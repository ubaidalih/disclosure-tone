Domestic nickel has the potential to become one of  the commodities of the future amid the world’s efforts  to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
The  world’s nickel demand will increase along with the rapid  development of electric vehicles.
Based on the 2020 Nickel Mining Booklet of the Ministry of  MEMR, the amount of Indonesia’s nickel reserves reached  72 million tons from the world’s nickel reserves was 139.4  million tons, in other words 52% of nickel reserves are in  Indonesia.
Not only that, Indonesia has the largest nickel  producer in the world of 800,000 tons from the total world  nickel production of 2.68 million tons.
After Indonesia,  there is Australia with nickel reserves reaching 15%, then  Brazil 8%, Russia 5%, and a combination of a number of  other countries such as the Philippines, China, Canada,  and others 20%.5 Since 2014, Indonesia has prohibited nickel ore export  to support the downstream of domestic nickel industry  which will give a positive impact to the economy.
Since  the implementation of the policy, investment in nickel  ore processing plants in Indonesia has experienced a  significant increase.
In 2021, around 37% of total world  nickel smelter production capacity was from Indonesia.
Of the total production capacity in Indonesia, mostly  produce FeroNickel (“FeNi”) and Nickel Pig Iron (“NPI”)  which is the main raw material of stainless steel.
The rise of nickel smelter investment in Indonesia is  certainly something to be grateful for.
Aside from being  inline with government program in nickel industry  downstream, the multiplier effect to the economic  improvement in the area of nickel development project  was also felt by the citizens.
On the other side, the  increase in supply of nickel processed products from  Indonesia, especially in FeNi and NPI, could cause the  market to be in the surplus and put pressure on nickel  price.  5 https://www.
Fortunately, the electric car industry is also significantly  growing.
The emergence of policy or policy discourse on  limiting carbon emissions in several countries, especially  in Europe, has driven the industry growth of electric cars  and electric car batteries.
This is a good opportunity for  the world nickel market.
The dominant battery technology  used by the electric car manufacturers today is nickel, as  one of main raw materials.
Even though in 2021 nickel  consumption for electric car batteries was only 7% of  total world nickel consumption, it is  projected to be 41%  in 2040.
It brings positive sentiment to the world nickel  market and has been the trigger of the recent increase  in nickel price.
Overall, the world’s nickel inventories in London Metal  Exchange (“LME”) warehouse continued to shrink, until  it touched almost 100,000 tons level by the end of 2021  and resulted in nickel prices continuing to climb up until  it touched US$21,135/ton which is the highest level in  2021.
