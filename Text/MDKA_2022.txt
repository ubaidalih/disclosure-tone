ANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Strategically positioned to become a significant copper,  nickel, and gold producer, Merdeka establishes itself as a  leading player in the clean energy transition.
Supported by a world-class management team, Merdeka  possesses a portfolio of globally significant assets as  follows: • Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine;  • Tujuh Bukit Copper Project; • Wetar Copper Mine; • Pani Gold Project; • Wetar/Morowali AIM Project; and • MBM.
Review of Operations Tujuh Bukit Copper Project Tujuh Bukit Copper Project is wholly owned by Merdeka and  is located beneath the existing Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine.
The  Tujuh Bukit Copper Project hosts Mineral Resources of 1.70  billion tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.47% copper and 0.50 g/t  gold containing approximately 8.1 million tonnes copper and  27.4 million  oz  gold, including an Indicated Resource of 442  million tonnes at 0.60% copper and 0.66 g/t gold.
During 2022, a total of 63 holes were completed underground  with eight in progress at year end for a total of 41,891 metres  drilled.
A total of twelve holes were drilled from surface in  2022 with two holes in progress at year end for a total of  7,167 metres.
Resource definition drilling will continue throughout 2023  with 50,000 metres of drilling targeted from underground  and surface.
The surface drilling will also include  geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations for both  surface and underground infrastructure.
Merdeka has invested US$143 million to date on detailed  feasibility work to advance the project including an  1,890-metre-long exploration decline, past and current  resource definition drilling, geological modelling and  ongoing technical studies.
The bulk of the Pre-Feasibility  Study expenditure during the year was spent on resource  definition drilling and technical studies.
No LTI occurred  during the year, with the project achieving 90,000 hours for  a total 1.5 million LTI free man-hours since project inception. 115 Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahan Corporate GovernanceTanggung Jawab Sosial Perusahaan Corporate Social Responsibility PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk Laporan Tahunan | Annual Report 2022SPK sedang meninjau potensi pengembangan operasi awal  SLC 4Mtpa sebelum beralih ke pengembangan operasi BC  24Mtpa.
The PFS is assessing a potential development of an  initial 4Mtpa SLC operation before transitioning to the  development of a 24Mtpa BC operation.
The phased  approach, as contemplated in the PFS, enables Merdeka  to significantly reduce upfront pre-production capital  investment and achieve earlier cashflow that can be re- invested into the development of the larger, more productive  BC operation.
The SLC operation will enable access to  higher grade portions of the deposit and increased orebody  knowledge to de-risk and optimise the block cave expansion.
MBM MBM consists of the following assets: • SCM mine: Holds the IUP for one of the world’s largest  pre-production nickel resources.
Within total resources  of 1.1 billion dry metric tonnes of ore at 1.22% nickel and  0.084% cobalt containing 13.8 million tonnes of nickel  and 1.0 million tonnes of cobalt.
• RKEF Smelters: Two operating nickel RKEF plants (CSID  and BSID) producing nickle in NPI.
Each plant has a  nameplate capacity of 19,000 tonnes of nickel in NPI  per annum.
A third smelter (ZHN) is currently under  construction with a nameplate capacity of 50,000 tonnes  of nickel in NPI per annum.
Construction is expected to  be completed by mid-2023.
MBM is planning to capture  additional value downstream by modifying one of the  existing RKEF smelters and installing converters to the  ZHN smelter to enable the production of a high-grade  nickel matte.
• AIM Project: A modern processing plant capable of  producing acid and steam for use in HPAL plants, in  addition to producing other metals such as copper, gold  and iron.
• IKIP: A joint venture between MBM and Tsingshan Holding  group to develop an approximately 3,500 hectares  nickel industrial park, with a focus on HPAL processing  technology for battery metals within the SCM IUP area.
• MBM also has interests in several companies with  projects that support the overall nickel processing chain,  including a limestone IUP and hydro power project.
MBM is a vertically integrated nickel producer.
The SCM  mine will supply saprolite ore to RKEF Smelters producing  NPI at the IMIP, including CSID, BSID and ZHN.
SCM will also  supply limonite ore to HPAL plants at IMIP producing Mixed  Hydroxide Precipitate.
Following the development of IKIP,  the SCM mine will also supply limonite ore to HPAL plants  within the industrial park.
Total combined production throughout 2022 was 2% above  annual nameplate capacity of 38,000 tonnes of nickel in  NPI.
Compared to last year, the NPI price increased by 12%,  resulting in higher revenue by 5%.
Offsetting the higher  revenue was an increase in operating cash costs, primarily  driven by higher commodity price for nickel ore, smelting  coal and electricity. 116 Laporan Manajemen Management ReportIkhtisar Kinerja Performance HighlightsProfil Perusahaan Company Profile PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk Laporan Tahunan | Annual Report 2022MBM sedang memperbaharui jalan angkut dari lokasi  pertambangan ke IMIP untuk meningkatkan akses dan  memungkinkan pengiriman bijih saprolite yang lebih efisien  dari lokasi pertambangan ke smelter RKEF.
MBM is currently upgrading the haul road from the mine site  to IMIP to improve access and allow the efficient delivery  of saprolite ore from the mine site to the RKEF smelters.
The construction is being managed by MMS and significant  progress has been made with 8.4 million cubic meters of  material movement representing 62% completion at the  end of December quarter.
MBM will continue to upgrade the  haul road with the aim of achieving a 9% grade by Q2 2023,  allowing the efficient transport of saprolite ore to begin.
As  of 31 December 2022, US$44 million has been spent on the  haul road upgrade with further US$$37 million expected to  be spent to complete the haul road upgrade.
In addition,  MBM is also monitoring Huayue’s Feed Preparation Plant  (“FPP”) construction project inside the SCM IUP and the  installation of a slurry pipe to a HPAL plant at IMIP.
This  construction is expected to complete by the end of Q2 2023  and will allow the transport of limonite ore to begin.
AIM Project The AIM Project will purchase high-grade pyrite ore from  Wetar.
The AIM plant, under construction at IMIP, is designed  to treat the pyrite ore from Wetar at a nominal rate of  1,060,000 tonnes per year.
The plant will produce sulphuric  acid, saturated steam, iron ore pellets, copper cathode, lead- zinc hydroxides, gold and silver doré.
Significant growth  in acid demand is expected as additional HPAL plants are  planned to be constructed in Indonesia.
China Covid lockdowns that commenced in February 2022  were ongoing until December 2022, resulting in delays to  some aspects of procurement and deliveries as different  cities go into lockdown.
These events that remain outside  the control of Merdeka have slowed design, procurement,  fabrication, manufacturing, and delivery for many structural  and mechanical items.
As a result, first acid at the AIM Project  is anticipated in 2H 2023.
Design reached 99.4% complete  while international procurement has reached 97.7%.
Pani Gold Project Merdeka owns a 70% effective economic and equity interest  in Pani.
Pani hosts a significant undeveloped gold resource  that is located across two adjacent mining tenements (Pani  CoW and Pani IUP) in Gorontalo Province, Sulawesi.
Merdeka  commenced drilling and feasibility study work during Q1  2022.
Pada tahun 2022,  pengeboran dengan mata bor intan menyelesaikan 38  lubang dengan luas 10.294 meter dan 100 lubang RC dengan  luas 16.190 meterBy the end of December 2022, eleven drill rigs were  operating at Pani targeting the central Baganite zone and  two rigs were operating in the Paceda area undertaking a  sterilisation drilling program, with a total of approximately  24,432 metres of diamond drilling completed.
A large drill  program is planned for 2023 of approximately 350 drill  holes for 55,000 – 70,000m.
The feasibility study program for Pani is advancing  and remains focused on optimising the project capital,  mining schedule and maximising throughput and  recovery opportunities from the early mining years, using  conventional processing methods.
The gravity/carbon-in- leach metallurgical test work program continues to return  high gold recoveries across all ore zones of the deposit.
Siting studies have identified two potential tailings storage  facility locations, with both now the subject of geotechnical  drilling, feasibility planning and early stage permitting  considerations.
As of 31 December 2022, the Pani Mineral Resource has an  estimated mineral resources of 263.6 million tonnes at 0.75  g/t gold containing 6.35 million  oz  of gold.
Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine This project is located about 60 km southwest of the central  government of Banyuwangi Regency or about 205 km  southeast of Surabaya, the capital of East Java Province.
In 2021, this project commenced its commercial production  that reached 124,730 oz of gold.
Gold production for the full year 2022 was 125,133  oz  at an  AISC of $1,131/oz net of silver credits, compared to target  of 110,000 to 125,000  oz  of gold at an AISC of $1,000  to $1,200/oz net of silver credits.
Full year 2022 cash  cost was $780/oz and the AISC was $1,131/oz net of silver  credits.
The implementation of several cost reduction initiatives  around processing consumable use (cyanide, cement, and  hydrogen peroxide) coupled with haul fleet and haul road  efficiencies assisted in mostly offsetting the rising prices of  consumables and components at Tujuh Bukit.
Recent drilling and updated geological interpretation for  controls on the gold and silver epithermal mineralisation  has identified multiple near mine targets to the current  operations.
Merdeka continued an aggressive drilling  program aimed at testing these new targets which are near  the existing open pit operations with the aim of extending  mine life.

With the change in capital structure in 2022, the group’s  Debt to Equity Ratio increased from 17.2% in 2021 to 46.3%  this year.
Based on the Management’s analysis, the group  has successfully optimized the use of its resources to  improve its capital ratio.
Basis of Selection in Capital Structure The group maintains a strong capital ratio to support its  business and maximize shareholders’ value.
In 2022, Merdeka had US$660 million of material  commitments for capital expenditures, which will be used  for construction costs of AIM Project, SCM Mine and ZHN  Smelter, exploration costs of Pani Gold Project and Tujuh  Bukit Copper Project, and capital goods of Tujuh Bukit Gold  Mine and Wetar Copper Mine.
Most of these capital goods  investments are denominated in US Dollar, Chinese Yuan  and Rupiah.
Merdeka plans to finance these capital goods  investments using cash generated from operation and debt,  and cash proceeds from MBM IPO.
The actual capital goods investments could be significantly  higher or lower than the budgeted amount due to various  factors, including, among others higher construction costs,  additional unplanned costs, and Merdeka’s ability to obtain  sufficient external funds for the capital goods investments.
