This was due to the post-pandemic scaring effect, high inflationary pressures due to  demand-supply imbalances, geopolitical conflicts, and structural problems in the world’s major economic countries.

In general the main commodities,  the decrease was quite significant compared to 2022.
For example, there were large declines in coal commodities (-55%  YoY), natural gas (-58% YoY), and palm oil (-28% YoY).
These commodity price declines throughout 2023 were due to the  normalization of the goods and services value chain, as well as moderate growth in the US and China.

Furthermore, the unstable relationship between the US and  China also filled the geopolitical conditions in 2023 which are expected to continue this year.
Fourthly, the increasing concern on environmental issues also impacted global conditions in 2023, including the El-Nino  phenomenon that started in April 2023.

As of Quarter III-2023, economic growth was 5.1% and was expected to close at 5.0% at the end of 2023, better  than the economic growth of other countries.
The domestic economy was supported by household consumption and  investments, and Government spending, while net exports still contributed positively, even though they decreased quite  significantly compared to their contribution in 2022.
Based on production, Indonesia’s GDP saw support from the primary and secondary sectors such as the mining sector,  processing industry and construction.
In the processing industry (manufacturing) subsector, growth was still solid in  the metal processing industry, basic metals, transportation equipment; whereas, export-oriented processing industries,  such as clothing and footwear, experienced contraction.

Inflation closed at 2.6% in 2023 with a core inflation low at 1.8%.
The risk of inflation lies in the food segment which will  reach 6.4% as of December 2023, caused by El-Nino and the protection policy of commodity exporting countries such  as India which has banned rice exports.

As an illustration, in the period August-October 2023 the outflow of foreign funds was -US$ 4.5  billion in the bond and stock markets, which caused the Rupiah exchange rate to depreciate to its weakest position of  IDR15,940 in October 2023.
However, the exchange rate gradually strengthened to reach IDR15,397 at the end of 2023 in  line with the more dovish monetary policy outlook of the United States central bank.

Business Support FunctionsCompany ProfileManagement Report2023 Performance206 From Local to GlobalManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance Operational Overview   per Business Segment Previously in 2022, BNI’s operating segments were divided based on main customer groups and products, as follows:  Corporate & International Banking, Institutional Banking, Enterprises & Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking,  Treasury, Head Office and Subsidiaries.
BNI applies the 3 Dimensional concept for internal performance assessment,  namely Segment Dimensions, Channel Dimensions and Product Dimensions, which this concept has been used since  2022.
For segment reporting purposes, the reported subject is based on Segment Dimensions.
In 2023, BNI implemented changes to the operating segments which were aligned with changes in the nomenclature  of the Board of Directors based on the results of the 2022 Annual GMS which was held on March 15, 2023.
Regarding  changes to the operating segments according to the Annual GMS, BNI made changes by moving the SME Business from  Enterprise & Commercial Banking and Business Programs from Institutional Banking were combined with Consumer  Banking to become the Retail Banking segment.
Further, this review contains an explanation regarding the operating segments which are also presented in the Audited  Financial Report Notes as part of this annual report.
The BNI segment is divided into 2 (two) aspects, namely: 1.
Operating segments describe BNI’s business segments based on main customer groups and products.
Previously in  2022, BNI’s consolidated operating segments were divided based on main customer groups and products, as follows:  Corporate & International Banking, Institutional Banking, Enterprises & Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking,  Treasury, Head Office and Subsidiaries. 2.
Geographic segments based on geographical distribution of BNI’s business, divided into Indonesia, the United States,  Europe and Asia.

Determining Operational Segments aims to develop solutions for customers end-to-end across channels, both physical  and digital, or across products.
Customers can then maximimize its use of all BNI products based on their needs through a  one-stop service presented by each regional relationship  manager.
Through customer analysis and portfolio management  (CAU), customer needs in the Business Banking sector are translated into a value-based industry analysis, business  banking sector portfolio management, review and improvement of Business Banking loan systems and procedures, and  customized loans for customers with minimal risk.
It is hoped that the results of this analysis will improve the quality of  BNI services focused on the “customer centric” principle, sharper in efforts to fulfill customer needs.
Adopting an operating segment system will then have an impact on the way BNI’s Operating Segment is measured and  performs based on customer ownership.
With this approach, BNI has proven that is increasingly capable of continuing  to improve overall in its branches, regionals, head office and overseas branch offices in terms of providing information  for decision making and improvements based on data and customer needs to maximize BNI’s performance.
In summary, each reporting per segment in BNI’s operating segment reporting is as follows: Wholesale & International  Banking Loans disbursed, customer  deposits and other transactions  belonging for corporate  customers, both SOEs and private  businesses including financial  institutions and overseas branch  office customers.

Meanwhile,  hibank aims to become a digital bank that acts as a provider of digital-based integrated financial solutions, especially in  the MSME segment, which will become a new and future growth engine for BNI.

This figure exceeded the Regulator’s  minimum requirement of 20%.
Quality improvements also occurred in the gross Bank Loan  Quality Ratio (NPL), which decreased to 1.2% in December  2023, an improvement compared to the gross NPL in  the previous period which was 3.4%.

As one of its digitalization strategies, BNI creates digital  innovations and initiatives on an ongoing basis through  quality digital products that provide added value for  customers from different segments, not only in providing  basic banking services but also “Beyond Banking” services  that meet people’s daily and thematic needs in collaboration  with various ecosystem partners.
BNI’s digital product  strategy also contributes to increasing the number of new  customers, increasing customer loyalty, sustainable income  and third party funds.
As well as financial benefits, digital  banking also improves accessibility, product diversification  and the customer experience.
In addition, digitizing  business processes is useful for simplifying business  processes and opening up new business potentials to  increase efficiency at BNI.
Apart from being internal, BNI’s digital initiatives are  also carried out to support the 2025 Indonesian Payment  System Blueprint issued by Bank Indonesia, to encourage  the payment industry to undergo digital transformation  within the framework of developing open banking, data  openness, improving the retail payment system, and  interlinks between banks and digital financial services.
To support customer convenience in carrying out banking  transaction activities, BNI has flagship products called  BNI Mobile Banking for retail customers, and BNIDirect  for wholesale customers.
These two flagship products  have won national and international awards.
They contain  customer-centric features to adapt to customer needs for  their daily activities.
These various digital products are  supported by powerful IT capabilities, advanced data  analytics and Open APIs connected to third party services.
Digital  Banking Based on data from Bank Indonesia (BI), digital financial  transaction performance remained strong in the third  quarter of 2023, where digital banking transactions recorded  IDR15,148.71 trillion, a growth of 12.83% (yoy).

Digital Banking Products and Services for  Consumers  1.
ATM/CRM This Banking service channel is ready to facilitate  customers 24 hours a day to conduct cash withdrawals  (Cash Recycle Machine/CRM), balance checks, transfers,  payments and purchases.

In addition, in the current era of digitalization, many people  are moving towards cashless transactions, where many people, especially in big cities, no longer depend on using cash for  transactions.
However, to accommodate the needs of certain segments that have not yet shifted, development continues to  be carried out.
In this case, the development of the ATM/CRM channel is carried out in collaboration with other parties to meet  the quite high transaction needs.
Currently, the development of the ATM/CRM channel focuses on developing joint partnerships with third parties such as  e-Commerce partners and BPDs in Indonesia that provide cardless cash withdrawal banking services and other services.
The  development of the ATM/CRM channel is also focused on developing the CRM channel, where customers can make cash  deposit and withdrawal transactions without needing to go to a branch.
In the long run, the use of this CRM channel makes it  easy for customers to transition from cash to digital transactions, thereby creating a cashless society supported by BNI digital  banking products. 2.

As infrastructure develops to  reach rural areas such as villages, this factor will have an  impact on the decreasing use of SMS banking.
However,  this is not an excuse for BNI not to pay attention to this  channel as it is an optional channel that can accommodate  customer needs in areas without adequate internet access.
So development of UI/UX was carried out in 2023 to provide  the same experience for customers when accessing the  BNI channel on their smartphone.3.

Deposits from Customers Following the tight banking industry liquidity conditions  during 2023, BNI’s TPF in 2023 amounted to IDR810.7 trillion,  an increase of 5.4% from the previous year’s position of  IDR769.3 trillion.
Of the total deposits, 71.6% were Current  Account Savings Accounts (CASA), or the equivalent of  IDR577 .5 trillion, compared to 3.6% growth, or IDR20.2  trillion the previous year, mainly supported by increase in  current accounts of 9.8% to IDR345.5 trillion.
This increase is in line with BNI’s policy to optimize funding  sources from low-cost third parties.
BNI’s Third Party Funds  (TPF) made a dominant contribution to liabilities, with  87 .0% and 86.5% of total liabilities in 2023 and 2022.
BNI’s  TPF portfolio composition is well diversified with 71.6  % savings and current account (CASA) and 28.4% time  deposits in 2023.
This showed that even during tight liquidity, BNI was able  to collect low-cost funding sources.
From the currency side,  BNI TPF in Rupiah had a dominant portion, with 78.2% and  81.8% in 2023 and 2022, similar to the loan disbursement  dominated in Rupiah.
On the other hand, the portion of TPF  in foreign currency was 21.8% and 18.2%.
TPF in foreign  currency reached IDR176.8 trillion, with TPF in US Dollars  having the dominant portion, reaching IDR165.8 trillion in  2022 and IDR134.0 trillion the previous year.
For 2023, the interest rate and annual profit sharing for TPF  in Rupiah was 0.0%-7 .5%; 0.0%-6.9% (US Dollar); 0.0%-1.8%  (Singapore Dollar); 0.0%-0.1% (Euro), and 0.0% (Japanese  Yen).

All the key steps for BNI’s NPL management. 2.

Return on Asset (ROA) BNI’s Return on Assets (ROA) was recorded at 2.6%, an  increase compared to 2022 of 2.5%.

Return on Equity (ROE) BNI’s Return on Equity (ROE) - Equity Based was 15.2%,  an increase compared to 14.9% in 2022.
This increase  was due to the significant increase in BNI’s profits in  2023, with BNI’s capital being sufficient to support the  Company’s operations. 3.
Net Interest Margin (NIM) BNI’s Net Interest Margin (NIM) in 2023 saw a slight  decrease from 4.8% in 2022 to 4.6% in 2023, which was  due to the significant percentage increase in interest  expense, which was above the growth in interest income. 4.
Ratio of Operating Expenses to Operating Income  BNI’s BOPO ratio (Operating Expenses to Operating  Income) decreased to 68.4% in 2023 from 68.6% in 2022.

BNI’s LDR in 2023  was 85.8%, an increase of 1.5% compared to 84.2%  the previous year.
This was mainly due to loan  disbursements growth (7 .0% YoY) compared to Third  Party Funds (TPF) that only grew by 5.1% YoY , mainly  due to the increasingly tight market liquidity. 2.
Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) BNI’s Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio in 2023  increased to 89.0% compared to 83.4% in 2022.
The  RIM ratio level in 2023 met the regulatory requirements  of 84%-94%.

Governance (Good Corporate Governance) Governance Assessment is an assessment of  the quality of Bank management regarding the  implementation of Governance principles. 3.
Profitability (Earnings) Assessment of the profitability factor includes  evaluation of profitability performance, profitability  sources, sustainability of profitability, and  profitability management. 4.
In assessing capital adequacy, BNI links  capital adequacy to its risk profile.
Bank Health Level Assessments are reported to the  regulator (OJK) every 6 months (semesterly) in the  June and December periods.
The results of the Bank  BNI Health Level assessment for the period December  31, 2023 are ranked “Healthy” , which means that: 1.
BNI’s condition is generally healthy, so it is  considered capable of facing significant negative  impacts from changes in business conditions and  other external factors. 2.

PRIME LENDING RATE (SBDK)  Based on OJK Regulation No. 37/POJK.03/2019 concerning Transparency and Publication of Bank Reports, and Bank  Indonesia Regulation No. 7/6/PBI/2005 concerning Transparency of Bank Product Information and Use of Customer  Personal Data (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2005 No. 16, Supplement to State Gazette of the Republic  of Indonesia No. 4475), Commercial Banks who carry out conventional business activities in Indonesia are required to  report and publish the Prime Lending Rate (SBDK) in Rupiah.
The prime lending rate implementation aims to provide clarity to customers and facilitate customers in weighing the  benefits, costs and loan risks offered by the Company.
In addition, publication of SBDK is intended to improve Good  Governance and promote healthy competition in the banking industry, among others, through the creation of better  market disciplines.
In addition, the prime lending rate is used as an indicator of the amount of loan interest rates that will be charged to  customers applying for Bank loans.
Therefore, BNI updates the prime lending rate in accordance with the movement of  the reference interest rate set by Bank Indonesia.
In general, SBDK is calculated based on 3 (three) components, namely  the Principal Cost of Funds for Credit (HPDK) arising from customer fund collection activities, operating expenses  incurred for fundraising and lending and the profit margin component set by the Company in its lending activities.
The  prime lending rate calculation does not take into account the risk premium component of the debtor, the amount of  which depends on the risk assessment of each debtor.
Thus, the loan interest rate charged to debtors is not necessarily  the same as the prime lending rate.
BNI is required to report the prime lending rate calculation to Bank Indonesia on a monthly basis and periodically  publish it in wider media.
The prime lending rate calculation applies to corporate loans, retail loans, micro loans and  consumption loans (KPR and non-KPR).
However, Bank Indonesia submits the classification of corporate loans, retail  loans and consumer loans (KPR and non-KPR) based on internal criteria used by each bank.

The  increase in prime lending rates in the second quarter had an impact on loan yields in the period from quarter 2 to quarter  3, which experienced an increase of 24bps.
On a YtD basis, SBDK for each segment increased by 5bps and loan yields  increased by 40bps.
In 2023, BI raised the benchmark interest rate 2 (two) times, at the beginning of the year in January 2023 and in October  2023, and until now it is at the same level as before the pandemic, namely 6%.
In total, BI raised interest rates by 50  basis points in 2023.
The Bank Indonesia Board of Governors (RDG) Meeting on October 18-19, 2023 increased the BI  7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) to 6%, the Deposit Facility interest rate to 5.25%, and the Lending Facility interest  rate to 6.75%.
These increases were to strengthen the policy of stabilizing the rupiah exchange rate from the impact of  increasing global uncertainty.
On December 21, 2023, Bank Indonesia started to use the name BI-Rate as the policy interest rate replacing the BI 7-Day  (Reverse) Repo Rate to strengthen monetary policy communication.
This name change does not change the meaning  and objectives of BI-Rate as Bank Indonesia’s monetary policy stance, and its operationalization continues to refer to  Bank Indonesia reverse repo transactions with a tenor of 7 (seven) days.
The Bank Indonesia Board of Governors (RDG) meeting on December 20-21, 2023 decided to maintain the BI-Rate at  6.00%, the Deposit Facility interest rate at 5.25%, and the Lending Facility interest rate at 6.75%.
The decision to maintain  the BI-Rate at 6.00% was consistent with the focus of pro-stability monetary policy, namely to strengthen the stabilization  of the Rupiah exchange rate, and were pre-emptive and forward looking steps to ensure inflation remained under control  within the target of 2.5 ± 1% in 2024.
This upward trend impacted BNI’s NIM that increased to 4.6% in 2023 compared to 4.8% (2022) and 4.7% (2021).

The Pension Funds increase was 35.3% compared to 2022.
The Bank  Guarantee Under Counter (BGUC) increase was 32.4% compared to 2022.
The Forex Trading increase was 29.1%  compared to 2022 in line with the increase in sales volume.
Social & Environmental ResponsibilityGood Corporate GovernanceCapital & Risk Management Practices ESG CommitmentFinancial Statements Annual Report 2023  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk321 BNI maintains a good level of liquidity and solvency.
This is demonstrated by BNI’s ability to fulfill all maturing obligations  on time, both in terms of debt principal payments and interest payments.  1.
Bank Liquidity: Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt BNI’s ability to fulfill short-term obligations is carried out by good liquidity management.
To increase short-term liquidity resilience, BNI maintains adequate liquidity by managing several indicators, including  Primary Reserve (Minimum Demand Deposit and Cash), Secondary Reserve (Liquidity Reserve), and Liquidity Coverage  Ratio (LCR) in accordance with regulatory provisions.
LCR is a comparison ratio between High Quality Liquid Assets  (HQLA) and estimated total net cash outflow for the next 30 days in a crisis scenario.
In December 2023, BNI’s LCR  reached 191.5% (bank only) and 197 .2% (consolidated), above the regulator’s provisions which stipulate that LCR  fulfillment is at least 100%.
To manage liquidity over a longer period (1 year), BNI maintains the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFSR) by increasing  the Bank’s funding stability, adjusted to the composition of assets and administrative accounts.
NSFR is a ratio  comparing the Available Stable Funding with the Required Stable Funding.
As of December 2023, BNI’s NSFR was  145.3% (bank only) and 146.4% (consolidated), above the regulatory provisions which stipulate NSFR compliance at  a minimum of 100%.

For capital management, the Bank considers factors such as: optimizing capital  return to shareholders, maintaining a balance between higher profits and gearing ratios, and the security provided by  a healthy capital position.
This is carried out so that BNI has a strong commitment to maintaining its capital structure  composition in accordance with the applicable provisions, and does not violate the minimum limit provisions applied  by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) as the banking regulator.
Core Capital Core capital represents the Bank’s capital and consists of main core capital and additional core capital in accordance  with the Financial Services Authority (POJK) Regulations concerning “Minimum Capital Requirements for Commercial  Banks” .
BNI’s core capital increased by 10.1% from IDR118.9 trillion in 2022 to IDR130.9 trillion in 2023.
This increase  was due to the current year’s profit in 2023, and the decline in the position of mark to market losses from the fair  value of financial assets measured at fair value in other comprehensive income compared to 2022. 2.
Supplementary Capital (maximum 100% of core capital) Supplementary capital (referring to the Bank’s capital) consists of general reserves for productive assets and capital  instruments that meet Tier 2 requirements.
BNI’s Supplementary Capital decreased from IDR12.4 trillion in 2022 to  IDR11.1 trillion in 2023, or 10.7%.
This decline was due the amortization of subordination bond values that can be  calculated as a component of complementary capital.

Business Support FunctionsCompany ProfileManagement Report2023 Performance334 From Local to GlobalManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceAssumptions Used in Formulating the 2023 T arget For the 2023 target preparation process, economic growth  was predicted to slow down compared to 2022.
At that time,  the narrative for a global recession was high, however BNI  believed that the Indonesian economy remained solid.
Economic growth in 2023 was estimated to be in a range  of 4.8 – 5.2%, supported by household consumption and  government spending.
Along the way, as well as these  two components, investments also became a contributor  to GDP , where economic growth in 2023 was estimated  to close at 5%.
For prices, the high inflation in 2022 (5.5%) as a result  of rising fuel and food prices in Semester II - 2022 was  expected to enter a normalization phase in June - July 2023  and close in a range of 3.0 - 3.8% by the end of 2023.
In 2023,  as expected, inflation did enter a normalization phase, but  it occurred one month earlier in May 2023, supported by  price stability in core groups of goods and services as well  as in volatile groups.
At the end of 2023, inflation closed  in line with projections at 2.6%, with low core inflation of  1.8% (lower than the average for the previous five years,  except during the pandemic period when it reached 3%).
The exchange rate projection for 2023 was based on  expectations of easing uncertainty concerning rising interest  rates in other countries, especially in the United States Business T arget    Achievements in 2023 (US), but it was supported by the good fundamentals for  the Indonesian economy, which where expected to be  a factor in attracting capital inflow in the second half of  2023.
In 2023, the exchange rate was estimated to be in a  range of IDR14,800 – 15,100 per US dollar.
As of December  31, 2023, the rupiah reached IDR15,250 per US dollar, due  to external pressure including the uncertainty regarding  interest rates in the US, and the additional political turmoil  in the Middle East.
The projected BI7DRRR interest rate (later changed to BI  rate) in 2023 was 5.50 – 5.75%.
This was based on several  simultaneous matters including inflation and global interest  rates - especially in the US, which were still relatively high.
In  terms of direction, this projection was realized, when interest  rates rose to 6%, or one percent above the original estimate.
Taking into account moderate economic growth in 2023,  BNI estimated the banking industry’s loan expansion would  be between 8 - 10%, supported by TPF growth of 6.8 - 9%.
In reality, the loan growth occurred as expected, closing at  10.3% FY23, at the upper limit of BNI’s projections.
But on  the other side, TPF saw lower growth than the average for  the last five years (except during the pandemic period), and  reached 3.8% FY23.
Even though loan growth was above TPF ,  the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) remained healthy, at 84% FY23.

Credit at the end of 2023 reached IDR695 trillion or grew 7 .6% from 2022, driven by expansion in the low-risk segment,  namely blue chip corporations, both private and state-owned, consumer credit and subsidiary companies.
When compared  to the 2023 target, credit distribution has relatively reached the target with an achievement of 97%.
To support this credit  expansion, Third Party Funds (DPK) in 2023 were recorded to grow 5.4%, to IDR810.73 trillion, which also reached the  target set by the company.

Achieving the Minimum  Capital Adequacy Requirement (KPMM) target was due to an increase in BNI’s performance during 2032.
BNI’s success  can also be seen in the management of the quality of productive assets.
Gross Non-Performing Loans (NPL) was reduced  to below the predetermined target.
This demonstrates BNI’s strong commitment to continuing to maintain the quality  of its assets.
Business Support FunctionsCompany ProfileManagement Report2023 Performance336 From Local to GlobalManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceMatters that potentially had a significant effect on  the Bank’s business continuity in 2023 Global conditions significantly changed over the last one to  two months, especially due to increasing geopolitical risks,  high bond yields in the United States, and the economic  slowdown in China.
One impact on the domestic economy was the volatility of  the rupiah exchange rate over the current year.
However, the  domestic economy and financial system stability remains  relatively well maintained, including the performance of  the rupiah where the fluctuations were not as deep as in  other developing countries.
Related to these conditions, BNI undertook strategic steps to  maintain a solid performance.
The transformation program  carried out in a disciplined manner, and the selective  and measurable growth strategy taken have guided the  company to deliver optimal income for shareholders, and  to carry out the intermediation function well.

Achieving quality asset and sustainable finance Management Assessment of Matters with a  Potentially Significant Influence on the Bank’s  Business Continuity Overall, BNI carries out scenario analysis covering 2 (two)  levels of crisis, namely liquidity and solvency.
Liquidity  crisis to see the impact of stress conditions on BNI’s liquidity  conditions as shown by liquidity indicators, namely MSR,  LCR and NSFR.
While, the solvency crisis is to see the impact  of stress conditions on asset quality (NPL Gross and NPL  Net), profitability (ROA, ROE and BOPO) and capital (KPMM  and KPMM CET 1) of BNI.
Each crisis condition includes  scenarios of idiosyncratic crisis conditions, market-wide  shock, and a combination of both. 1.
Liquidity Stress Test Scenario The liquidity stress scenario is divided into 3 (three)  scenarios, namely idiosyncratic, market wide, and  a combination, which are prepared based on Bank  Indonesia’s granular stress test scenarios, and the LCR  calculation scenario which is adjusted to BNI’s internal  conditions.
Social & Environmental ResponsibilityGood Corporate GovernanceCapital & Risk Management Practices ESG CommitmentFinancial Statements Annual Report 2023  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk337 a.
Idiosyncratic Scenario Liquidity stress is triggered by a decrease in BNI’s  trust or reputation that can be caused by evevnts such  as a decrease in BNI’s rating, IT failure, the occurrence  of significant internal fraud or other risk events that  have an effect on decreasing public trust in BNI that  can trigger large withdrawals by customers of TPF .
Market-wide scenario Liquidity stress is triggered by a decrease in liquidity  in the interbank market due to worsening overall  domestic and/or global economic conditions,  resulting in significant deposit withdrawals and  difficulty in obtaining funding in the market, either  through the liquidation of assets owned or through  interbank loans.
Combination Scenario Liquidity stress is triggered by stress resulting from a  combination of idiosyncratic and market-wide events. 2.
Solvency Stress Test Assumptions The solvency stress test assumptions for each scenario  are as follows: a.
Idiosyncratic Scenario Solvency stress is triggered by an inaccurate loan  growth strategy, and accompanied by an inaccurate  loan monitoring process, causing several debtors  to default using MEV in the baseline scenario.
The  default debtors are determined based on the results  of an assessment of the impact of macroeconomic  conditions on BNI’s loan portfolio for the Q3 2023  period.
It was projected that there was a shadow NPL  (collection of 1 restructured non-Covid and Pre NPL)  of IDR26.7 trillion, and assumption that 29% (IDR7 .79  trillion) of total shadow NPL will default.
Market-wide scenario Solvency stress is triggered by tight global financial  conditions, market financial turmoil and economic  recession that will have an impact on bank solvency  conditions in terms of loan risk and market risk,  including: • Decreasing GDP growth rate • Increasing inflation • Increasing interest rates • Changing exchange rates • Worsening commodity prices • Other macroeconomic worsening • Market risk increasing due to high Government  bond yields c.
Combination Scenario Solvency stress is triggered by stress from  idiosyncratic and market-wide conditions that  influence simultaneously.2.
Solvency Stress Test Scenario  The solvency aspect stress test is designed to see the  impact of changes in internal factors (idiosyncratic), as  well as external factors (market wide) or together, both  directly and indirectly, on the Bank’s solvency.
These  scenarios are interrelated with stress tests on indicators  of asset quality, profitability and capital.
A number of internal and external (market wide) factors  for stressful conditions are seen to be independent or  interrelated, influencing several bank performance  variables.
These changes are then transmitted into the  Balance Sheet and Profit/Loss items so that they have  an impact on the Bank’s financial ratios.
The relationship  between each solvency indicator in each stress scenario  will ultimately have an impact on the Minimum Capital  Adequacy Ratio (KPMM).
The stress test scenario is carried out for 3 scenarios,  the first scenario is the shock condition triggered by  internal factors (idiosyncratic) such as a decline in loan  quality, especially in a number of quality Debtors who  have shifted from current to default, then in the second  scenario the trigger factors taken into account come  from external factors.
The third scenario is a combination  of internal (idiosyncratic) trigger factors together with  external (market wide).
Some of these disturbances are transmitted into the  Bank’s financial performance in the form of changes  in a number of variables.
Changes in the quality of the  loan portfolio, Net Open Position, and market prices in  the securities and bond portfolio will affect the value of  Risk Weighted Assets (RWA).
Changes in income, reserve value, unrealized gains/ losses and other comprehensive income of the bank  will be transmitted to further influence Profit/loss for  the current period which has an impact on the Bank’s  capital.
In the end, changes in Profit/Loss and RWA will  affect the Bank’s minimum capital adequacy (KPMM).
Assumptions Used by Management in Conducting  Assessment of Matters That Have a Potentially  Significant Effect on the Bank’s Business  Continuity Several assumptions BNI considers when conducting a  business continuity assessment include: 1.
Liquidity Stress Test Assumptions The liquidity stress test assumptions for each scenario  are as follows: Business Support FunctionsCompany ProfileManagement Report2023 Performance338 From Local to GlobalManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceDetails of Matters   Arising in 2023 The following are details of the matters that arise throughout 2023, their impacts, and the handling efforts carried out  by BNI.
T rend of increasing interest rates Background: The increasing interest rates trend started in 2022, brought on by high global inflation due to rising commodity prices.
Central banks in  many countries responded by instigating policies to increase benchmark interest rates.
In Indonesia, the prediction was that the peak  inflation increase that occurred at the end of 2022 would subside in 2023.
However, uncertainty concerning global interest rates, as well  as pressure on the rupiah due to external factors, meant that for Bank Indonesia to maintain exchange rate stability and inflation they  had to raise interest rates in 2023, in January and October 2023 to 6.00%.
From a fiscal perspective, the Government held a conservative  expenditure realization viewpoint to stabilize prices and protect people’s purchasing power.
These two prudent policies helped to maintain  Indonesia’s economic fundamentals but had an impact on tight liquidity in the banking sector, as illustrated by the M-2 money supply  growth indicator that was at its lowest level, especially in the last quarter of 2023.
Tight liquidity, rising interest rates, and increasingly  intense competition in the industry all had an impact on increasing the cost of funds in national banking Impact on BNI: BNI’s Cost of Funds increased.
Fee Based Income is Not Y et Optimal Background: The Company’s Fee Based Income decreased year on year in 2023, with the decrease mainly due to a decrease in fees from securities, and  the migration of transfer transactions to BI Fast with its lower fees.
The decrease in fees from securities was due to the increase in bond  yields in 2023, which caused a decline in the securities market price.
In addition, the migration of transactions to BI Fast with its lower  fees resulted in a decrease in ATM and e-channel fees, but this decrease is estimated to only occur in 2023 considering that 90% of the  Company’s customer transfer transactions have switched to BI-Fast.
Impact on BNI: Fee based income has decreased compared to 2022 (year on year) Anticipatory Efforts T aken by BNI: • Encouraged cross selling and customer transactions to increase the contribution of non-interest income (fee based income), including  products from subsidiaries.
• Offered ecosystem business and comprehensive financial solutions to institutional banking segment customers, as well as the  Wholesale & International Banking segment.
• Increased wealth business by developing attractive investment services and products.
Social & Environmental ResponsibilityGood Corporate GovernanceCapital & Risk Management Practices ESG CommitmentFinancial Statements Annual Report 2023  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk339 Business Prospects    for 2024 As we enter 2024, the global economy is expected to  continue to slow.
Based on IMF projections, global economic  growth will reach 2.9%, lower than the projected figures for  2023 and 2022 of 3.0% and 3.5%.
At the same time, although  global inflation has decreased, the figure is still higher  than the average before the pandemic, so the prospect  of benchmark interest rates in many countries is not  expected to reach the normal phase.
The US central bank,  The Federal Reserve, is projected to lower its benchmark  interest rate (FFR) to 4.50-4.75% in 2024, with projected  individual expenditure inflation (PCE inflation) at 2.4%.
For  comparison, the average FFR interest rate in the five year  period before the pandemic (2015-2019) was 1.1%, and the  PCE inflation rate was 1.6%.
Normalization back to the 2%  inflation range is estimated to occur in 2026.
The implications of the global interest rate trend will have  an impact on the prospects for Bank Indonesia’s benchmark  interest rate, which was projected to fall to 5.5% from 6.0%  by the end of 2023.
In the context of time, a decrease in Bank  Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate is projected to occur  in the second semester, as inflationary pressure tends to  decline, followed by the potential for FFR cuts.
In terms of the domestic economy, GDP growth is projected  to remain solid at 5.0%.
The impact of the global economic  slowdown certainly had an effect on exports and investment,  however, the trend of private consumption (53% of the  national GDP pie) is estimated to increase along with the  effect of election spending (spending is projected to reach  0.6% - 1.3% of GDP), and the realization of more aggressive  fiscal spending.
Solid economic growth is projected to also  influence banking loan growth.
Loan growth is estimated to  remain solid at 7 .5-10% in 2024, supported by better liquidity  conditions amidst an increase in the money supply due to  the realization of the fiscal budget, election expenditure and  the potential for a reduction in the MSR level.
In terms of exchange rates, Rupiah volatility is expected  to be lower in the second semester of 2024 with the trend  of FFR cuts and a decline in the dollar index.
Foreign fund  flows are expected to be higher in the second semester  of 2024 so at to partially cover the current account deficit  which is projected to reach -0.5% to -1.0% of GDP in 2024.

Performance Indicator 2024 Projection Quality balance sheet growth Credit Growth 9% s.
d 11% TPF Growth 7% s.
d 9%   Gross NPL below 2% Profitability Net Interest Margin (NIM) at least 4.5% Return on Equity (ROE) - Equity Based 15% s.
d 16% Capital Structure Minimum Capital Requirement Ratio (KPMM) above 20% Dividends Dividend Payment Projection in 2024 40% s.
d 50% Credit growth has historically had a strong correlation with  GDP growth.
For this reason, with Indonesia’s solid GDP  growth, we project loan demand will increase, especially in  the second semester of 2024, mainly driven by consumer  credit and working capital credit.
From the internal side, we  also have aspirations to grow better.
Apart from the corporate  and consumer segments, we see opportunities for better credit  growth from the small and medium segments.
As enablers, we have strengthened credit processes, risk  management, and credit scoring models that will enable us  to grow healthily in the small and medium segments, with a  credit growth target in the range of 9-11%, which is in line with  projected credit growth in the industry.
To support the need for credit expansion, DPK, especially the  growth of current accounts and savings or CASA, will strive  to grow better from 2023 in the range of 7% to 9%.
In terms  of asset quality, the NPL ratio continues to show impressive  improvement.
The NPL ratio at the end of 2023 was at the level  of 2.1%, an improvement compared to 2022 which was 2.8%.
In line with BNI’s selective and prudent credit growth  over the last 3 years, the NPL ratio improvement trend is  projected to continue to improve below 2%.
This quality balance sheet growth projection is expected  to have a positive impact on BNI’s profitability, so that NIM  is projected to be above 4.5% and Equity Based ROE in the range of 15% to 16%.
This projected increase in profitability  is expected to be able to strengthen capital as reflected in  the KPMM ratio which is above 20%.
This level gives BNI  the ability to meet the BNI group’s business expansion and  investment needs, as well as promising dividends without  having a negative impact on capital adequacy.
With this improved performance projection, the company  is optimistic that profits in 2024 will increase.
This is in line  with BNI’s commitment to providing optimal value for all  stakeholders, especially shareholders To achieve this projection, BNI is pursuing various strategic  steps that will be taken in 2024, namely: 1.
Increase business expansion through the top tier  by strengthening risk management. 2.
Improvement of the Digital Platform to optimize  transactional banking and cross selling which focuses  on increasing sustainable AUM, CASA and FBI. 3.
Strengthening business networks through  optimizing outlets. 4.
Develop international business networks to  support global market penetration. 5.
Strengthen Human Capital and IT to increase  productivity. 6.
Optimization of the BNI Group in strengthening the  position of Subsidiary Companies.
Social & Environmental ResponsibilityGood Corporate GovernanceCapital & Risk Management Practices ESG CommitmentFinancial Statements Annual Report 2023  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk341 Marketing    Aspect The relatively well-maintained stability of the national economy  and domestic financial system amidst ever-increasing global  economic turmoil shows Indonesia’s resilience and success  in anticipating existing challenges.
Especially with digital  disruption bringing massive social change, BNI must respond  to these challenges and try to formulate various strategic  innovations to become practical solutions for users of financial  services, especially banking today.
Marketing Strategy In the digital era which continues to develop increasingly  rapidly, BNI has consistently been a leading bank that is  agile in facing rapid changes and market needs as well as  increasingly tight business competition.
BNI is committed  to always presenting the best products and services, which  not only strengthen its brand image and increase market  share, but also create added value for all stakeholders  anywhere and at any time.
BNI always carry out the continuous improvements to  banking services that are in line with the RACE values  (Risk Culture, Agile, Collaboration, Execution Oriented).
To communicate these products and services, a corporately  integrated marketing communications strategy and  company messages are needed with BNI’s products.
These  messages start from BNI’s commitment to becoming a state- owned bank with global capabilities, to BNI’s commitment  to becoming a digital-based bank.
As a national bank with competitive advantages in  international business, BNI has aspirations to contribute significantly to Indonesia’s economic growth and bridge  Indonesian business to the global arena.
BNI’s presence  abroad can also be seen as a door for investors, Diaspora  and potential customers to learn more about Indonesia  through BNI products and services.
This idea is the basis  of BNI’s corporate message and will be confirmed in 2023  with the theme “Global Reach, Indonesian Pride” on the  77th anniversary.
This theme reaffirms BNI’s mission to  realize big goals, achieve global market share, and become  a source of pride for the Indonesian people.
On the marketing side, in order to maximize the results  that will be obtained, marketing activities are focused on  the wider community through several digital platforms that  are available and used by BNI.
One of them is the use of  BNI’s organic social media.
As of December 31 2023, the  Twitter/X @BNI account has 1,246,998 followers, Instagram  @bni46 with 1,463,529 followers, then BNI Facebook has  406,906 fans and TikTok @bni46 with current followers of  430,900.
The engagement rate on BNI social media is one  of the best in the banking business sector.
Marketing communications are also carried out through  paid social media placement activities or using online  publishers, especially those that are always ranked in the  top 1 - 5 in monthly visitors.
This activity was carried out  with the aim of increasing the scope of the message to be  conveyed.
In addition to using digital media, the media also  used for marketing communications are offline media and  electronic media such as through national and international  iconic events, videotrons, television and radio.

BNI assets  in 2023 will increase to IDR1,087 trillion, with a market share value based on assets to industry of 9.5%.
Market Share based on  Third Party Funds (TPF) In the 2022-2023 period, BNI was able to maintain its position as one of the largest banks in Indonesia in terms of collecting  TPF .
With deposits reaching IDR811 trillion, BNI’s market share in terms of  TPF was 9.9% in 2023.
Market Share based on Loans Disbursed In line with the increase in TPF , BNI optimized its loans disbursed by paying attention to loan quality, as it reached IDR695  trillion.
This achievement was equivalent to a market share of 10.0% in 2023.
Social & Environmental ResponsibilityGood Corporate GovernanceCapital & Risk Management Practices ESG CommitmentFinancial Statements Annual Report 2023  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk343 Comparison of BNI Stock Performance and LQ-45 Index (YTD) in 2023 BBNI LQ-451-Jan 1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun 1-Jul 1-Aug 1-Sept 1-Oct 1-Nov 1-Dec16,5 3,6% In the midst of various external challenges in 2023,  especially related to increasing geopolitical risks, high  inflation and global interest rates, especially in the United  States, as well as the economic slowdown in China, BNI  was able to maintain solid performance in 2023 so as to  provide optimal returns for its shareholders.
Consistency in implementing transformation oriented  towards strengthening fundamentals has had a positive  impact as seen from improvements in the Cost of Funds  compared to pre-pandemic levels, a shift in the portfolio  to blue chip customers, as well as a reduction in the risk  profile as reflected in improvements in the NPL and Credit  Cost ratios.
This progress will ensure the Company can  continue to record a sustainable increase in ROE (Return  on Equity) in the future.
Meanwhile, within the conglomeration framework, the  Company’s focus in 2023 is to continue the transformation  and improvement of subsidiaries’ businesses, as being  intensified at BNI Finance and Hibank.
BNI Finance is  refocusing its business to financing the consumer segment,  so that the existence of BNI Finance will complement the  BNI Group’s product choices through providing Motor  Vehicle Credit (KKB).
Meanwhile, Hibank is aimed at  becoming a digital bank that acts as a provider of digital- based integrated financial solutions, especially in the MSME  segment, which will become a future growth engine for BNI.
Through these strategic steps and supported by increasingly  better financial performance, the Company has succeeded  in maintaining the trust of shareholders and the public regarding the strong fundamental performance of the  Company which increasingly provides a positive outlook  for BNI’s future performance.
This trust is reflected in the  good performance of BNI (BBNI) shares in 2023.
Until the close of trading on the Indonesian stock exchange  on December 29 2023, BBNI closed at a price of IDR5,375  per share or an increase of 16.5% year to date (YTD), much  higher than the LQ-45 index which was recorded to have  only grown 3.6% YTD.
This achievement means BBNI’s  Market Capitalization value has reached IDR200.5 trillion.
This achievement was accompanied by the achievement  of several records for the Company; (1) The market  capitalization value (market cap) of IDR200.5 trillion is the  largest ever recorded in the company’s history; (2) Market  cap continues to increase supported by high confidence  from investors, where throughout 2023 BNI recorded a net  foreign purchase value of IDR 3.5 trillion or the equivalent  of 1.75% of the total market cap.
This ratio was the best  on the Indonesian Stock Exchange in 2023; and (3) BBNI  ranked itself as the Top-7 issuer with the largest level of  trading liquidity (turnover) in 2023 with a total trading value  reaching IDR63 trillion.
We believe that this good stock performance is a reflection  of the quality of BNI’s performance during 2023, which is  also equipped with the right strategy for the long term.
In  the future, the company will continue to be committed to  achieving increasingly healthy and sustainable profitability  so as to provide optimal value for all stakeholders, especially  shareholders.
