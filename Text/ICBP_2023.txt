Statement of Profit or Loss  & Other Comprehensive Income Net Sales In 2023, ICBP delivered a healthy sales performance  despite the challenges.
Consolidated net sales grew 5% to Rp67.91 trillion driven by volume growth and higher ASP of domestic and overseas operations.
Domestic sales increased by 3% to Rp47.62 trillion while overseas sales increased by 9% to Rp20.29 trillion (equivalent to US$1.33 billion) representing approximately 30% of the consolidated net sales.
Over the past two years, significant price increases have led  to a higher inflation rate, impacting the purchasing power of  the lower income segment.
To address the challenge, ICBP’s  strategy was focused on providing daily food and beverage  products to consumers across all segments.
We ensured the  availability of our products in various categories, offering  different brands, variants, pack sizes and price points.
We  also enhanced our operational excellence throughout the year.

The increase in sales was supported by higher sales volume and ASP.
In 2023, the Dairy Division delivered total sales value of  Rp9.13 trillion which was 3% lower than Rp9.44 trillion in 2022 due to an industry slowdown and intensified competition.
