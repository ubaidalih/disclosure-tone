MANAGEMENT  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK9898 ANNUAL REPORT 2023GLOBAL ECONOMY AND  INDONESIA In 2023, the global economy was still recovering from the  impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war.
It was  promoted by the recovering global supply chain, with  the cost and delivery time returned to the pre-pandemic  conditions, which it aligned with the Public Health  Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of COVID-19  status by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 5,  2023.
However, global economic growth generally slowed  down with the higher global uncertainty and created  more divergence in international growth.
The influential  factors were the high inflation and the more aggressive  tightening of monetary policy by the Central Bank that  weakened economic activities.
The World Economic  Outlook (WEO) report in October 2023 predicted that the  2023 economic growth would slow to 3.0% compared to  2022 3.5%.
The developing countries (emerging markets  and developing economies) were still the primary motor  for global economic growth of 4.0%, while the growth for  developed countries (advanced economies) was only 1.5%.
The uncertainties will still be in the 2024 global economy.
Moreover, the 2023 economic challenge will continue  in 2024, such as the geopolitical tension, digitalization  stream, privacy and cyber security, and climate change.
The geopolitical tension between Russia-Ukraine, the  Palestine-Israel war, and the trade tension between the  United States-China triggered the economic, trading, and  investment fragmentation and created the aggressive  tightening of monetary policy in several countries.
Therefore, the global economy is predicted to slow from  2023 of 2.9% to 2.9% in 2024.
The Indonesian economic growth in 2023 was still  maintained amid the uncertainties of the global economy,  with the 3Q23 GDP growth progressing positively to  4.94%.
Although it was lower compared to the last  period, the economic growth in Indonesia was relatively  stable despite the previous global economic fluctuation.
Meanwhile, the economic growth in 2023 was 5.05%.
The  increasing private consumption supported the growth  aligned with the rising services sector consumption, consumer confidence, and investment growth as the  National Strategic Projects (Proyek Strategis Nasional or  PSN) continue to complete.
Moreover, the General Election  (Pemilihan Umum or PEMILU) in 2024 will also influence  Indonesia’s economic growth.
PEMILU can boost public  consumption, Government spending, and the growth of  specific industries such as publishing and printing, food  and beverage, and transportation.
Indonesia’s inflation rate in December 2023 was as low  as 0.41% (MtM), so the inflation rate in 2023 was 2.61%  (YoY), lower if compared to 2022 at 5.51% (YoY).
Therefore,  the 2023 inflation rate was still under control in a target  range of 3.0±1%.
The inflation rate was a positive result  of the consistent monetary policy and the great synergy  of inflation control between Bank Indonesia and the  Government (Central & Regional Government) through  the Central Controlling Inflation Team (Tim Pengendalian  Inflasi Pusat or TPIP) and Regional Controlling Inflation  Team (Tim Pengendalian Inflasi Daerah or TPID) with the  National Movement of Food Inflation Control (Gerakan  Nasional Pengendalian Inflasi Pangan or GNPIP) in  many regions.
Meanwhile, the Indonesia Stock Market recorded a good  performance in 2023 by enhancing the IDX Composite  (IHSG), which reached 6.16%, higher than last year’s 4.09%.
If we consider the main macro indicators, the currency  exchange of Rupiah towards USD in 2023 was relatively  stable.
The foreign exchange rate of the Bank of Indonesia  on January 2, 2023, was Rp15,514, and on December  29, 2023, it was closed at Rp15,493 per USD.
The Bank of  Indonesia reference interest rate or BI-Rate (previously BI  7-days Repo Rate) slightly declined from 5.75% on January  2023 to 6.00% on December 2023.
The Indonesian macroeconomic stability could be  perceived by the Assessment of Indonesia’s Sovereign  Credit Rating, one of which is the Fitch Rating, it retained  a credit rating on BBB and outlook stable on September  2023.
Another credit rating institution, Moody’s Investor  Service, also maintained Indonesia’s credit rating on Baa2  with a stable outlook as of March 2023.
It showed that  Indonesia’s economy still gained decent stability, though  it encountered the challenge of delayed global economy.
PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK99 99 ANNUAL REPORT 2023INDONESIAN  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  INDUSTRY The Indonesian Government is constantly encouraging  advancement in the telecommunication sector to  accelerate the national digital transformation.
The  Government has prepared three phases for developing  the digital economy up to 2045.
The first phase,  “prepare,” begins with improving the digital foundation to  ensure the public›s readiness to adapt.
The second phase,  “transform,”  is an acceleration attempt to transform the  public and the economy into a smart business.
Lastly, the  third phase, “lead,” will be done by producing standards  for technological innovations in the future.
Besides, The Government, through the Coordinating  Ministry for Economic Affairs Republic of Indonesia,  has determined six main pillars of digital economic  development and its strategic direction frameworks in  “Buku Putih Strategi Nasional – Pengembangan Ekonomi  Digital Nasional 2023”, such as: 1.
Infrastructure, with the strategic direction on the  availability and quality of digital infrastructure and  physical (i.
, fiber optic network, data center, and  electricity). 2.
Human resources, with the strategic direction on the  availability and advanced professional talents with  the required competencies to accommodate digital  economic development. 3.
Business climate and cyber security, with the strategic  direction on the end-to-end implementation of digital  business landscape and cyber security. 4.
Research, innovation, and business development, with  the strategic direction of acquiring, developing, and  implementing competency and technology to create  innovation inside or outside IT. 5.
Funding and investment, with the strategic direction  on the ability to generate/attract funding sources  and capital investment into ICT and other supporting  industries. 6.
Policy/regulation, with the strategic direction on the  adequacy of policies/regulations to support digital  economic development and capital investment.
To support the acceleration of the national digital  transformation, the Government has specifically assigned  Telkom to execute the Electronic Procurement System and  all its supporting systems, which cover funding, planning,  establishment, development, integration, operation,  and system maintenance.
This specific assignment was  officiated through Presidential Regulation number 17 Year  2023 regarding the Acceleration of Digital Transformation  in Government Procurement of Goods/Services.
This  assignment is part of Satu Data Indonesia Implementation  Framework and its interoperability between systems within  the Electronic-based Government System Framework  (SPBE).
This Presidential Regulation is expected to  accelerate the digital transformation of the Government  Procurement of Goods/Services as an effort to improve  independence and growth and ensure equal distribution  of the national economy.
The Central Bureau of Statistics data shows that the  telecommunication industry 3Q2023 grew by 8.52% from  the 3Q2022 of 6.95%.
The Government and stakeholders  have strongly supported creating a conducive ecosystem  that pushes the development of the telecommunication  sector.
It shows that there is still a growth opportunity for  the telecommunication industry, aligning with the rapid  growth of the digital technology ecosystem.
However,  there are a few challenges the telecommunication sector  faces, including the constant demand for frequency amid  the expensive spectrum price, high regulatory charges of  Operation Rights Fees (BHP) and USO, and the obligation  to build the infrastructure to remote areas with minimum  incentive.
These challenges prevented the growth of the  telecommunication industry from reaching its maximum  potential during its role as an enabler of the digital  ecosystem.
Therefore, comprehensive solutions and synergy between  the Government and telecommunication service  providers are needed to ensure the development of the  telecommunication industry ecosystem in Indonesia.
A  cohesive synergy is required to help advance the industry  and digital economy in Indonesia and prepare a conducive  digital ecosystem amidst a constantly growing digital era.
Furthermore, uncertainties in facing quick digitalization  growth can also hinder the flow of funding entering  Indonesia.
MANAGEMENT  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK100100 ANNUAL REPORT 2023On the other hand, with the growing demand for internet  connection services, Indonesia’s operators have shifted  to FMC business to create better customer experience,  unbreakable connection, efficiency, and synergy inter- services.
Recently, Telkomsel has aggressively developed  its FMC business with its product “Telkomsel One,” which  launched after the integration of IndiHome into Telkomsel  in 2023.
There was XL Axiata, which had previously  introduced the mobile and fixed convergence product of  “XL SATU Lite” and supported by the acquisition of LinkNet  and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison with the acquisition of  MNC Play.
Therefore, these initiatives could increase the  connectivity growth of Indonesia’s telco industry and give  significant added value services to subscribers.
The telecommunication sector is predicted to be one of  the most profitable and beneficial sectors from potential  growth at the beginning of the political year 2024.
Data  traffic is assumed to increase amid Christmas and  the 2024 New Year momentum, not to mention the  2024 Election from the start of the year, thus causing  an increase in internet data usage, especially in social  media.
To anticipate the spike in data traffic, Telkom has  prepared an infrastructure that will operate constantly,  both from the 28-submarine cable infrastructures nor the  international traffic route through the Batam & Manado  gateway, as well as other preparations to ensure a stable  and reliable network condition for all customers.
TELECOMMUNICATION  INDUSTRY COMPETITION The telecommunication industry nowadays is constantly  developing, specifically digital communication, as most of  the public chooses.
This condition provides an opportunity  for Telkom, the biggest telecommunication provider  in Indonesia, to proactively push the development of  digitalization across the country and benefit from the  various opportunities available to expand its business.
Therefore, Telkom will continue to focus on producing  products and services to fulfill the public’s needs, especially  amidst the vastly developing global digitalization.
Mobile Business In 2023, Telkom still stands as the mobile operator with the  most subscribers in Indonesia with 159.3 million subscribers  and 50.5% in market share.
The country’s other big mobile  operators are Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH), XL Axiata,  and Smartfren.
At the end of 2023, SIM card penetration  decreased 0.3% with 315.6 million subscribers compared  to the previous year.
Cellular data traffic also increased,  while voice and SMS had a declining trend due to the  lower usage of these services along with the available Over  the Top (OTT) service and more affordable smartphones.
To measure this decline and extend the service period,  Telkomsel initiates a personal and personification  marketing scheme to offer more added-value packages,  meet the subscribers’ needs, and increase voice package  penetration.
Telkomsel also commits to its mobile data  and digital services to ensure we will always meet growing  demands.
Fixed Broadband & Fixed Voice Business  (Fixed Business) At the end of 2023, Telkom, through the brand IndiHome  that has integrated into Telkomsel, still holds the position  of the market leader in fixed broadband business in  Indonesia with 10.1 million subscribers and 66.7% of market  share.
Other leading competitor operators of Telkom  in the fixed broadband industry are PT First Media Tbk  (First Media), PT Eka Mas Republik (MyRepublic), PT Supra  Primatama Nusantara (Biznet Home), PT MNC Kabel  Mediacom (MNC Play), Cyberindo Aditama (CBN Fiber),  PT XL Axiata (XL Home), PT Oxygen Multimedia Indonesia  (Oxygen.
id), and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (Indosat  HiFi).
The competition was fiercer with the newcomer of  PT Indonesia Comnets Plus (a subsidiary of PT Perusahaan  Listrik Negara) under the Iconnet brand.
With the relatively  low penetration of fixed broadband in Indonesia and the  other operators widening their coverage area, Telkomsel  commits to increasing its penetration and proactively  accommodating the fixed broadband market demand by  offering high-speed and better packages with excellent  infrastructure and coverage across Indonesia.
PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK101 101 ANNUAL REPORT 2023Data Center Business The Data Center business has become one of the main  pillars in the growth of TelkomGroup’s digital platform  business.
Telkom has been provided with a data center  with an integrated domestic and global network and is  supported by various flexible, modular, seamless, and  scalable comprehensive services.
Telkom’s subsidiary  responsible for managing the data center business in the  domestic market, Telkom Data Ekosistem (NeturaDC),  owns and operates Hyperscale Data Center at Cikarang,  Enterprise Data Center at Serpong, Sentul, and Surabaya,  as well as Edge Data Center.
NeutraDC competes with  several other companies that also provide data centers,  such as DCI Indonesia, Indosat Ooredoo, Moratelindo, IDC  Indonesia, BDx, Atria, Princeton DG, NTT Communication,  EdgeConnex, and Biznet.
Aside from those, Telkom also  operates in the global market through Telin, Telkom’s  subsidiary, which provides data centers globally and  competes with other providers in Singapore and Hong  Kong.
International Traffic and Interconnection  Business As for now, there are two traditional (non-VoIP)  international traffic IDD (International Direct Dialing)  operators in Indonesia, such as Telkom and Indosat  Ooredoo Hutchison.
However, non-VoIP services are less  desirable for the public with the emergence of OTT services  and digital communication, such as LINE, WhatsApp, and  Skype, which provide VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)  services that can also get international access.
It has  resulted in a constant decrease in Telkom’s revenue from  international traffic IDD (non-VoIP).
Therefore, Telkom  implemented added value by collaborating with OTT,  some of which are by providing connectivity, data center,  and Content Delivery Network (CDN) services that can  help increase revenue for TelkomGroup.
Network and Satellite Infrastructure  Business Telkom’s infrastructure business line, specifically  the tower, is managed by Mitratel.
There are a few of  Telkom’s main competitors in the tower business, such  as Tower Bersama Infrastructure and PT Profesional  Telekomunikasi Indonesia.
Mitratel conducts an organic  strategy to implement added value by building new  towers and co-locations to provide services to mobile  operators, implementing inorganic strategies through  tower consolidations in TelkomGroup’s internal, and  acquiring towers from other tower companies other than  TelkomGroup.
On the satellite business line, through Telkom’s subsidiary  Telkom Satelit Indonesia (Telkomsat), Telkom provides  satellite-based services, including cellular backhaul,  broadband backhaul, enterprise network, military and  government network, video distribution and contribution,  DTH Television, communication for aviation, maritime,  and plantation, disaster recovery, and other satellite- based services.
with customers across Asia Pacific,  especially South-East Asia.
Telkomsat operates two  satellites, Telkom-3S Satellite and Merah Putih Satellite,  which serve telecommunication needs across Indonesia  and parts of Asia.
Telkom is also strengthening its satellite  business portfolio through collaboration with SpaceX,  providing backhaul service with Low Earth Orbit satellite  constellation of StarLink that could be a solution to   an undeserved area with improper connectivity or  unserved area with none connectivity, specifically the   3 T region (frontier, disadvantaged, and outermost region).
MANAGEMENT  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK102102 ANNUAL REPORT 2023Digital Business The rapid digitalization development means fiercer  competition in the digital business, with several main  competitors expanding the vertical industries such  as logistics, e-commerce, financial services, and travel  services.
Telkom develops several digital products suited  to the public’s need to join the competition and accelerate  their digital business.
Through Telkom Digital Leap, Telkom aims to be at the  forefront of digital transformation and provides various  opportunities for economic growth.
Telkom Digital  Business is constantly improving the digital ecosystem in  Indonesia through digital innovations to offer innovative solutions to the public and bring transformations in  reaching the Indonesian economy to digital sovereignty.

Telkomsel also established a subsidiary focused on digital  business, PT Telkomsel Ekosistem Digital or INDICO.
INDCO focuses on three sectors: edutech (Kuncie),  healthtech (Fita), and gaming (Majamojo).
INDICO is also  building two business platforms: Digital Food Ecosystem  (DFE) and Digital Goods Commerce (DGC), which have  been highly relevant to Telkomsel’s telecommunication  assets over all these years.

PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK153 153 ANNUAL REPORT 20232023 was a recovery period after the COVID-19 Pandemic,  during which public activities returned to normal and  the economy recovered.
Nevertheless, many economic  challenges remained this year, specifically the global  economy.
Amid the challenges, Indonesia’s economy  remained relevantly secured, with a GDP growth of  5.05% in 2023.
Despite weakening growth compared to  2022, which was 5.31%, Indonesia could still maintain its  relatively strong economic activity amidst the increasingly  challenging global conditions.
For the telecommunication sector, the vast growth of  internet usage in Indonesia benefits Indonesia’s leading  telecommunication operators.
The Indonesian Internet  Service Providers Association (APJII) survey stated that the  total number of internet users in Indonesia is 78% of the  total population, exceeding the average number of users  in South East Asia, which reaches around 77% and is the  most internet penetration than other Asian regions.
It  also shows that 99% of Indonesians access the internet by  using smartphones.
These numbers are expected to keep  increasing with the higher smartphone use in Indonesia.
It is an excellent opportunity for the telecommunication  industry, specifically mobile operators, to grow its business  further.
As internet use rises, so does the public’s interest in  various digital services.
Many digital services in Indonesia  are gaining traction, including music streaming, video  content, games, and digital financial services such as  online payment like m-banking and QRIS.
The Indonesian  Telecommunication Providers Association (ATSI) data  shows that monthly, 400-500 million online transactions  occur.
Therefore, the telecommunication sector plays  a significant role as an economic locomotive in other  sectors.
To support Indonesia’s digital economic growth and  strengthen its position in the telecommunication  industry, Telkom constantly develops and improves its  infrastructure, including fiber optic network development  and increasing its network capacity.
Telkom has also  adopted the latest technology and provided various IoT solutions to give added value to customers.
Therefore,  Telkom can improve its service quality and competitiveness  with a reliable infrastructure.
On the other hand, the Government has specifically  tasked Telkom to support accelerating the national digital  transformation by launching the Electronic Procurement  System.
It was officiated through Presidential Regulation  Number 17 Year 2023 regarding the Acceleration of Digital  Transformation in Government Procurement of Goods/ Services.
Telkom has prepared the adequate infrastructure  and capacity to support the acceleration of this digital  transformation.
Telkom has owned 175,692 km of fiber optic network  covering 501 cities/regencies.
Two satellites with 109  transponders, 231,226 base transceiver stations (BTS), and  42,106 telecommunication towers support this network.
Telkom also possesses supportive digital platforms of 31  data centers, with 26 domestic data centers and 5 abroad.
In the Mobile segment, Telkom notices the opportunities  from the increasing public interest in digital services.
Therefore, Telkom is trying to maximize the growth of  digital connectivity and platforms to develop digital  services by utilizing 5G network connectivity.
Telkom  will also be gradually developing IoT solutions, cloud  computing, and artificial intelligence following the  maturity and stability of the connectivity ecosystem.
Meanwhile, Telkom focuses on improving the customer  experience to maintain its market share and attract new  subscribers in the Consumer segment.
