For example, the  United States, which is one of the important players in the  global economy, recorded a recession at -32.9% in Quartal  2 2020.
In addition, countries in Asia and Europe such as  Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany and Italy remain  on the brink of economic recession in 2020.
Based on the World Economic Outlook, in October 2020  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted global  economic growth is to contract by -4.4%, but based on  the latest data released by the IMF in January 2021, the  global economic prediction in 2020 will only experience a  contraction of -3.5%.
National Economic Analysis Based on data from the World Economic Outlook and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), the world economy  contracted -3.5%.
The weakening of the world economy  also has had an impact on the national economy.
This is  reflected in the data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  growth released by the Central Statistics Agency (BPS)  which shows a significant contraction, namely -2.07%,  with the previous year’s GDP of 5.02%.
Bank Indonesia (BI) itself as the Central Bank which has the authority to maintain national monetary stability has also made several efforts lowering the BI 7-day repo rate.
BI continued to lower interest rates  from 5.00% to 3.75% in 2020.
With the efforts made by the  Government of Indonesia and Bank Indonesia, Indonesia  attempted to maintain inflation in 2020 at 1.68% The decline in the Indonesian economy in 2020 was due to  a decline in GDP in several essential sectors including the  mining and quarrying sector, manufacturing, construction,  trade and repair.
The mining and excavation sector itself  recorded a decline in GDP of -1.95%.
The decline in GDP in  the mining and quarrying sector was due to the decline in  the prices of several key commodities such as coal which  had been throughout 2020 as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic.
Until 2025, global demand  for coal will remain stable although by 2030 to 2050 it will  decline.
This is due to various climate change movements  that have been implemented around the world such as: a.
Paris Agreement  The Paris Agreement is a binding agreement on  climate change commitments adopted by 196  countries, agreed on December 12, 2015 and effective  on November 4, 2016 (Source: The United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change Website).
Each country must determine, plan and regularly  report on the contributions it is making to reduce  carbon emissions.
Power Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) Establishment of an Alliance of countries and non- governance aimed at accelerating the transition from  coal to clean energy, with 34 member countries, 35  subnational governments, and 44 world organizations  (website: PPCA).
Renewable Portfolio Standard This regulation requires for increased energy  production from new renewable energy sources.
This  requires power providers to generate a fraction of the  electricity to use new renewable energy sources.
Regarding price, the coal price trend is still improving for  2020 to 2040, based on Wood Mackenzie data for 6000 NAR  calorie coal which until 2040 is expected to rise from the  price range of USD58.91/mt to USD86.27 and is expected to  decrease slightly in 2040.
For 5000 GAR calories, according  to Wood Mackenzie data, remain stable despite a decline  in 2040.
