However, economic activity has not been able  to reach pre-pandemic conditions, especially in emerging market and developing countries.
Several significant factors continued to hinder recovery, such as the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, the ongoing war in Ukraine and increasing geo-economic fragmentation between the US and China as well as China and Taiwan.
In 2023, global economic activity has not been able to reach pre-pandemic conditions.
Several significant factors continued to hinder recovery, such as the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, war in Ukraine, and geoeconomic fragmentation between the United States and China.
PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report161 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04Other factors were more cyclical, such as extreme  weather events like El-Nino affecting harvests and driving global food crises, as well as monetary policy tightening to control inflation.
However, global inflation rate is starting to come under control from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the decline in the global inflation rate will continue in 2024 to 5.8%.
The US still faced inflation above target which  triggered high interest rates, increased fiscal pressure and the erosion of excess savings overshadowing economic weakening.
The US economy in 2023 only managed to grow to 2.5% from 2.1% in 2022 and still far below the 5.9% growth in 2021.
Economic condition in Eurozone countries also had not improved, with increasing fiscal deficits accompanied by persistently high inflation.
The economic growth in Eurozone countries weakened from 3.5% in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023.
The economic downturn in Eurozone countries  was mainly influenced by the impact the Russia-Ukraine war, including high inflation and central bank interest rate hikes.
The slowdown in the US and European economies has affected trading partners of the US and Europe.
China’s economic performance has not yet shown  the expected improvement amidst the widespread crisis in the property sector.
China’s weak economic performance in turn affects global commodity demand.
INDONESIA’S ECONOMIC RESILIENCE  REMAINS INTACT Indonesia’s economy demonstrated strong  resilience amidst various global dynamics.
Despite the pressure from declining commodity prices, including coal and palm oil, Indonesia managed to achieve positive growth throughout 2023.
The country’s economic growth remained above 5% for 7 (seven) consecutive quarters since the fourth quarter of 2021.
In the first quarter of 2023, Indonesia recorded  growth exceeding expectations at 5.03% (yoy), surpassing the 5.01% growth in the previous year’s fourth quarter.
This positive growth momentum continued into the second quarter of 2023, with a growth rate of 5.17% (yoy) driven by high private consumption and export performance.
However, entering the third quarter, domestic demand began to slow down, including weakening import and investment growth, as well as a slowdown in private sector credit growth.
Meanwhile, export performance weakened due to further declines in commodity prices.
Economic growth in the third quarter of 2023 declined to 4.94%.
Tinjauan Makroekonomi Macroeconomic Review PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report163 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04Despite the decline, cumulative national economic  growth until the third quarter of 2023 reached 5.05%.
This achievement placed Indonesia the fourth among G-20 countries in the third quarter.
Indonesia’s consistent growth demonstrates resilience and better economic performance compared to many other countries amidst the threat of recession due to interest rates, global geopolitical tensions, and various other threats.

Domestic demand and supply growth remained robust.
Household consumption and investment continued to grow at above 4%.
Meanwhile, exports grew slightly, and imports weakened due to the global economic downturn.
Inflation also remained controlled at 2.61% (yoy) as of December 2023, much better than the projected 3.6% for 2023.
Hence, on an annual basis, Indonesia recorded  economic growth of 5.05% in 2023, slightly lower than the 5.31% in the previous year.
This is in line with projections from several international institutions, including the IMF projecting Indonesia’s economic growth in 2023 at 5%, the World Bank at 5%, the OECD at 4.9% and the Bloomberg Consensus at 5%.

GCNI coal prices touched US$122 per ton in November 2023, down 72% from a high of US$434 per ton in September 2022, before experiencing an increase in December 2023 driven by rising natural gas prices due to tensions in the Middle East region as a result of Israel-Hamas conflict.
The drop in coal prices was mainly triggered by  falling import demand from China and India, the world’s two largest coal users.
After an anomalous situation occurred in 2022, especially as a result of geopolitical  conflicts in Europe in 2022, during 2023, coal prices continued to be corrected to approach a new equilibrium when a balance begins to occur between demand and supply.
China yang masih mengalami perlambatan  PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report167 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04reduce imports and meet most of its coal needs from  domestic mining production.
The same situation also occured with India.
Coal production in Shanxi Province, which is China’s main coal producer, was approaching 900 million tons in the first 8 (eight) months of 2023.
This has reduced China’s import volume significantly and is the main cause of the decline in coal prices to their lowest level in 2 (two) years ago.
India, the world’s second-largest coal importer, has  reduced its imports by 9% until end of September 2023.
India’s coal needs were met from domestic mining production.
India’s coal production in 2023 increased by around 12% compared to the previous year.
More than 80% of India’s coal production of 67.2 million tons was supplied by Coal India Ltd.
(CIL), a coal mine owned by the Government of India.
In 2022, natural gas prices soared as Russia cut Nord Stream 1 gas supplies to Europe in response to economic sanctions imposed on Russia for their invasion of Ukraine.
However, gas prices gradually returned to normal  since end of 2022, prompting several European countries to reactivate gas-fired power plants to replace their coal power plants.
The shift from coal to gas was also linked to the high price of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a greenhouse gas emissions trading system to encourage decarbonization in energy and industry.
Despite the continued decline, GCNI coal price in  2023 was still at the level of US$173 per ton, higher than US$142 per ton in 2021.
Looking at the trend, observers believed that  coal prices would reach a new equilibrium when demand became more stable due to strong supply.
The average GCNI coal price in 2023, which was still higher than the pre-pandemic level, raised the assumption that a new price equilibrium would Tinjauan Industri Industry Overview PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report169 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04bahwa equilibrium harga baru akan terbentuk di  atas angka psikologis US$100 per ton.
For coal mining businesses, this price level was still quite profitable as long as the productivity and efficiency of the mine were well controlled.
HEAVY EQUIPMENT MARKET  WEAKENS Production and sales of heavy equipment in 2022  were mainly driven by sectors related to mining commodities and construction.
The surge in coal and nickel prices boosted heavy equipment demand growth so that Indonesia’s heavy equipment sales in 2022 reached an all-time high, amounted to 20,546 units, up 40% from 14,705 units in 2021.
Conditions in 2023 were different as factors driving  demand and supply instability began to ease.
In the first quarter of 2023, heavy equipment sales has decreased by 4% year-on-year.
The decline in demand mainly occurred in the mining sector in line with the downward trend in commodity prices.
In the midst of a weakening market, some heavy  equipment players still recorded an increase in sales.
Realized sales of Komatsu heavy equipment by UT reached 3,145 units in the first half of 2023, up 9% compared to 2,873 units in the same period in 2022.
Most of Komatsu heavy equipment sales were absorbed by the mining sector at 63%, the remainder was absorbed by the construction (15%), forestry (14%) and agro (8%) sectors.
But most of the heavy equipment handed over to customers in the mining sector is for 2022 order fulfillment.
The  sluggish demand for heavy equipment   continued until end of 2023.
According to Industry  Research Data “Heavy Equipment Sales Trends in Indonesia” (www.
com) and the Indonesian Heavy Equipment Sole Agent Association (PAABI), the realization of heavy equipment sales in 2023 was only able to reach 18,123 units, down 13% from 20,546 units in 2022.
Association (Hinabi), national heavy equipment production until end of 2023 was recorded at 8,066 units, down 9% from 8,826 units in 2022.
Overall, the decline in demand for heavy equipment  was triggered by global uncertainty that impacted commodity prices, rising benchmark interest rates, and restrained budget absorption for government infrastructure projects ahead of the 2024 Elections.
Most businesses that use heavy equipment choose to be conservative and wait-and-see approach amidst the government transition and international geopolitical situation.
GOLD REMAINS PROSPECTIVE Gold prices in 2023 continued their rebound trend starting from the fourth quarter of 2022.
The strengthening of gold prices was mainly caused by recession fears and the policy of The Fed, which began to limit interest rate increases of 50 basis points (bps) in December 2022 after previously raising interest rates 4 (four) times to 75 bps.
Dovish interest rate policy slightly pressured the US dollar and lowered US government bond yields, making gold investment more attractive.

The Hamas-Israel war that has occurred since October 2023, has also triggered an increase in gold prices.
In December 2023, gold prices were above US$2,000 per troy ounce.
Hence, the price of gold from January to December 2023 increased by 7% with an average price of US$1,942 per troy ounce, 8% higher than 2022 average price of US$1,801 per troy ounce.
The increase in gold prices was also influenced by  market response to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.
These minutes reflected the Fed’s more cautious stance amidst US economic uncertainty, dynamic US economic data, and tight financial markets in determining how long high interest rates will be maintained.
The committee also agreed that long-term high interest rates remain necessary as long as US inflation is not yet in the 2% range.
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY  STAGNATED Infrastructure remains the backbone and one  of the main drivers of construction market.
The government has engaged the private sector to participate in the development, financing, and management of major infrastructure projects.
In 2023, the government had two priorities related to infrastructure.
Firstly, accelerating the completion of national priority infrastructure development.
Secondly, promoting the growth of new economic centers, including the National Capital City (IKN).
The government center core area in IKN is being built through the state budget (APBN).
Meanwhile, for the development of buffer zones, the government offers opportunities to private investors.
The government allocated a budget of Rp392  trillion for infrastructure development in 2023 State Budget (APBN), up 7% from 2022 budget of Rp366 trillion.
Some of these budgets were used for the development of basic service infrastructure, such as housing, schools and clean water supply system (SPAM).
For connectivity infrastructure, the government will construct new roads, toll roads, including the Trans Sumatera Toll Road (JTTS), bridges, underpasses, flyovers, 6 (six) new airport locations and railway lines.
The Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing  (PUPR) is assigned tasks through Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 120 of 2022 pertaining to Special Assignments for Acceleration of Infrastructure Development Implementation.
With this regulation, the Ministry of PUPR has been assigned 21 tasks to carry out infrastructure rehabilitation in various sectors, such as water resources, civil works, highways and housing.
The Ministry of PUPR was allocated a budget  of Rp125.18 trillion, larger than the 2022 budget allocation of Rp116 trillion.
However, in implementing the infrastructure spending program for 2023 fiscal year, the Ministry of PUPR focused on completing ongoing construction work, particularly National Strategic Projects (PSN), before the term of the Indonesia Maju Cabinet ends.
In other words, the government will not initiate new infrastructure projects.

The government tightened its budget structure and carefully selected projects to be carried out in 2023.
Several priority infrastructure projects and basic or connectivity infrastructure are targeted to be completed in 2023, or at the latest in the first semester of 2024.
According to the Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data,  the construction industry in the first quarter of 2023 experienced a slowdown from 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.3%.
This slowdown was caused by limited liquidity, capital, or budget at the beginning of the year, in line with historical pattern.
However, in the second, third and fourth quarters, the construction industry continued to grow by 5.2%, 6.4%, and 7.7% respectively on the back of strong domestic demand and the commencement of work activities on several new projects and government infrastructure development activities in various regions of Indonesia, including the IKN project in East Kalimantan.
PT United Tractors Tbk Laporan Tahunan 2023174 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis04NICKEL PROSPECTS IN THE GLOBAL  ENERGY TRANSITION ERA Indonesia boasts the world’s largest nickel reserves,  with approximately 72 million tons of nickel, accounting for 52% of the world’s total nickel reserves of 139 million tons, spread across Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, and North Maluku.
Historically, nickel demand was driven by the  stainless-steel industry.
In 2022, about 70% of nickel demand came from the stainless-steel industry.
Indonesia ranks as the world’s second-largest source of ferronickel for stainless-steel industry.
However, the global energy transition will increase demand for batteries for electric vehicles.
Battery sector will drive high growth in nickel demand in the future, although currently, the volume is still relatively small.
According to EV Volumes report, global electric  vehicle sales reached 10.52 million units in 2022, up 56% from 6.77 million units in the previous year.
Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Global Electric Vehicle Outlook projects global electric vehicle sales to reach 14 million units in 2023, growing around 35% from 2022.
Global demand for refined nickel reached reached  2,783 kilo tons in 2021 and is expected to increase with a CAGR of about 2.5% to reach 3,366 kilo tons by 2027.
Asia will be the dominant consumer of nickel, accounting for approximately 82% of global nickel demand in 2027.
Meanwhile, the supply of refined nickel reached 2,635 kilo tons in 2021 and is projected to reach around 3,390 kilo tons by 2027.
Indonesia is leveraging its strategic position as  the world’s largest nickel producer to develop the domestic electric vehicle industry.
The government has implemented policies to promote downstream nickel development to increase value-added.
The ban on the export of unprocessed nickel ore has spurred rapid growth in downstream sectors, including nickel smelters, stainless-steel producers, and battery factories.
Harga Nikel Bulanan 2022-2023   Monthly Nickel Price 2022-2023 AS$/troy oz | US$/troy oz 40,000 35,000 30,000 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 022,35533,924 21,48228,947 16,461 Jan 2022Feb 2022Mar 2022Apr 2022May 2022Jun 2022Jul 2022Aug 2022Sep 2022Oct 2022Nov 2022Dec 2022Jan 2023Feb 2023Mar 2023Apr 2023May 2023Jun 2023Jul 2023Aug 2023Sep 2023Oct 2023Nov 2023Dec 2023However, global nickel market did not perform  well in 2023.
The global economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions, geo-economic fragmentation between the US and China, as well as weaker-than-expected growth in China have impacted world nickel prices.
The average nickel price in 2023 only reached US$21,521 per metric ton (MT), down 17% from the 2022 average price of US$25,834 per MT due to slowing battery demand in China and high supply growth, especially from new production lines in Indonesia.
The start of additional production capacity in China  and Indonesia has led to an oversupply of class 2 nickel for stainless-steel, representing about two-thirds of the global nickel market.
At the same time, battery technology development using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has slowed the growth of nickel usage for the battery industry in China.
Nickel prices are expected to further decline by 10% in 2024 due to increased production in Indonesia and the Philippines, the two largest nickel producers globally.
However, electric vehicle battery demand is projected to increase in 2025 and become the main driver of nickel demand in the future.
RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT Indonesia’s renewable energy sector showed some positive sentiments that could affect the growth and investment prospects.
First, the government’s commitment to achieve the renewable energy target of 23% by 2025 was strengthened by the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) agreement between Indonesia and the International Partners Group (IPG) at the G20 Summit in Bali in 2022.
This partnership aims to achieve the electricity sector’s peak emissions target of 290 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030 and achieve a renewable energy mix of 34% by 2030.
Through the JETP agreement, IPG is expected to provide support cheap funding to accelerate the energy transition in Indonesia.
In addition, the demand for renewable energy  from industry, especially from energy-intensive industrial sectors such as cement, mineral refining and processing, mining, and data center, also increased rapidly.
In addition to the use of Rooftop Solar Power Plants (PLTS Rooftop), the construction of ground mounted PLTS and Floating PLTS was a quick solution for several industries.
Apart from this positive sentiment, the increase  in the renewable energy mix highly depends on PLN.
The way that PLN overcomes excess supply, conducts power plant auctions on a regular and scheduled basis, and relaxes rooftop PLTS permits, will determine the addition of renewable energy power plants.
In fact, according to the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) report, the trend in renewable energy development in 2023 slowed down, reaching only 0.97 GW from the target of 3.4 GW until the fourth quarter.
If this trend continues, Indonesia will not be able to reach its targeted peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2060 or earlier.
Indonesia already has energy transition plan and commitments by issuing various policies, including Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 112 of 2022 on the Acceleration of Renewable Energy Development, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation (Permen ESDM) No. 26 of 2021 on Rooftop Solar Power Plant Connected to the Electricity Grid of the Holder(s) of Electric Power Supply Business License for Public Interest, and updates to the National Energy Policy by the National Energy Council.
(Permen ESDM) No. 26 of 2021 has been revised by the minister of ESDM with Permen No. 2 of 2024 which was issued in January 2024.
However, classic factors such as the slow  implementation of existing regulations, certainty regarding the target of early retirement of coal-fired power plants before 2030 and the availability of competitive domestic funding for renewable energy are still major challenges that require a government breakthrough in efforts to improve the renewable energy investment climate and to encourage the acceleration of the energy transition.

PT United Tractors Tbk Laporan Tahunan 2023218 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis04Entering 2024, there are several factors of  uncertainty and risk.
On one hand, the global inflation slowdown and signals from the US Federal Reserve to delay interest rate hikes and ease monetary policy (dovish) increase the prospects of the global economy.
On the other hand, the Chinese economy, as a driver of the Asian economy, is expected to remain constrained.
The decline in commodity prices also becomes a challenge for several countries, including Indonesia.
High uncertainty risks have led the World Bank and IMF to revise their projections for global economic growth in 2024.
The World Bank revised it to 2.4% from the previous projection of 2.7% and the IMF revised it to 2.9% from the previous 3.0%.
However, the situation may change direction with  the expected plan from the Fed not to persist in high interest rate policies.
With the downturn in the heavy equipment market and increasing competition, the Company’s  strategy is to enhance sales coverage and explore opportunities in sectors that are still growing, such as the mining sector, mineral downstreaming, and agriculture, considering the government’s strong support for these sectors.
PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report219 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04rates during 2023 successfully lowered the US  inflation rate to around 3%.
The benchmark interest rate increase by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2023 also succeeded in lowering the inflation rate to around 3.4%.
Success in controlling the inflation rate potentially encourages central banks to gradually lower the benchmark interest rates.
In its report titled East Asia and The Pacific  Economic Update, October 2023 edition, the World Bank projected Indonesia’s economic growth in 2024 to slow to 4.9%.
The main factors contributing to the growth slowdown are the decline in global commodity prices affecting Indonesia’s export performance and income, as well as the influence of China’s economic slowdown.
Prospek dan Rencana ke Depan Prospect and Future Plans particularly in the infrastructure sector.
However, the World Bank also assesses that Indonesia has strong economic fundamentals and is capable to overcome existing challenges.
Private consumption, business investment, and  public spending are expected to increase after the General Election.
The inflation rate is forecasted to increase to 3.2%, higher than 2.6% in 2023 due to rising energy and food prices, but still controlled within the range of 2.5% plus or minus 1%.
Economic growth is expected to slightly decline to the range of 4.9% in 2024-2026 from 5.1% in 2023 mainly because commodity prices have returned to normal conditions.
This also aligns with Bank Indonesia’s prediction, which forecasts Indonesia’s economic growth in 2024 in the range of 4.7-5.5%.
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK Coal prices experienced strengthening starting in November 2023 approaching the psychological level of US$130 per ton.
Assuming conflict in the Middle East does not escalate, coal prices are expected to fall in 2024 and 2025 but remains well above pre-pandemic average prices.
The forecast assumes that consumption growth will slow in 2024 and 2025, with increasing demand from China and India, but declining in the US and Europe.
Coal consumption for the electricity sector in  Europe is expected to decline due to the strong growth of renewable energy and lower-cost natural gas production.
Conversely, consumption for the industrial sector is expected to increase by the end of 2024 and 2025 amid improving economic prospects, especially in Asia.
Coal production is forecasted to exceed demand, with strong growth in the three largest producers: China, India, and Indonesia.
In the mining sector, declining prices of commodities like coal and nickel lead consumers to adopt a wait-and-see approach, waiting for future commodity price developments.
In the construction sector, budget absorption for  infrastructure projects has been stalled since 2023 until the lead-up to the 2024 General Election.
Many infrastructure projects have not progressed according to their budget allocations.
These factors will drive a decrease in demand for heavy equipment, although the needs of the agricultural sector are expected to remain stable or not significantly affected.
Several heavy equipment manufacturers and distributors are taking a realistic approach by adjusting and reducing their sales targets for 2024.
Short-term gold price volatility is likely to continue  alongside increasing geopolitical risks.
At the same time, inflation and interest rate issues will be the main factors driving gold prices in the medium term.
The price of gold is expected to experience a slight decline in 2024 and 2025 as concerns about inflation and recession ease.
Prolonged conflicts in the Middle East are expected to increase global uncertainty.
If conflict escalation intensifies and spreads, the price of gold will continue to rise as investors shift their investments to safe-haven assets.
The Indonesian construction industry is projected to  grow by 4.7% in 2024.
Civil sector activities, including infrastructure, transportation, and utilities, are expected to increase by 4.1% to reach Rp156 trillion.
Major civil projects driving this growth include roads and bridges, dams, ports and civil works, and power plants.
The building sector is expected to grow by 5.2% to reach Rp193 trillion with significant contributions from housing and industrial projects.
There is an urgency for the government to complete programs and strategic projects that have been initiated in recent years, including the continuity of the development of the New National Capital City (IKN).
This commitment is crucial to ensure a smooth and sustainable transition to the next government.
To support the infrastructure agenda in 2024, the government has allocated a budget of Rp423 trillion in the 2024 State Budget, up 5.8% from the estimated realization of the infrastructure budget in 2023 amounting to Rp400 trillion and is the highest infrastructure budget allocation in the past 5 (five) years.
FUTURE PLANS Construction Machinery Segment The business climate outlook for 2024 will depend  on various factors, including geopolitical conditions and the success of the General Election held in February 2024, leading to the transition to a new government in October 2024.
With the downturn in the heavy equipment market and increasing competition, UT’s strategy is to enhance sales coverage and explore opportunities in sectors that are still growing, such as the mining sector, mineral downstreaming, and agriculture, considering the government’s strong support for these sectors.
In conditions of increasing competition, UT will continue to strive to maintain its market leader position with a market share in the heavy equipment industry of around 30%.
UT is committed to supporting green energy and  prioritizing sustainability principles in every aspect of its business.
One tangible step taken by UT is obtaining Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) at UT branch offices scattered across Indonesia.
REC is a form of service provided by PLN to facilitate customers in obtaining transparent, accountable,  PT United Tractors Tbk 2023 Annual Report223 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis 04yang transparan, akuntabel, dan diakui secara  internasional.
and internationally recognized recognition for using renewable energy, proving that the electricity per megawatt-hour (MWh) used by customers comes from PLN’s renewable energy generators.
For the first phase, UT targets to obtain REC for 15 branch offices.
Mining Contracting Segment Facing volatility in coal prices, PAMA consistently prioritizes operational excellence and cost leadership as fundamental pillars to run efficient production processes.
Furthermore, PAMA continues its digitalization development, combining initiatives such as Big Data, to enhance productivity and cost efficiency in production and enable timely business responses and decision-making.
In addition to focusing on coal mining activities, PAMA continues to explore diversification opportunities towards mineral extraction such as gold, nickel, and copper, as well as utilizing renewable energy to anticipate future declines in global coal demand.
Mining Segment – Coal Turangga Resources anticipates market uncertainty conditions by optimizing selling prices and quantities when prices are still favorable but prepares for deeper price declines.
Setting the sales price scheme must be precise, considering various possibilities.
From the operational side of the mines, hauling, and port, Turangga Resources will review the entire operational process to optimize productivity and increase efficiency.
The Company will ensure that long-term plans are implemented according to targets.
Mining Segment – Gold PTAR’s long-term strategy is to achieve sustainable business by continuously exploring new resources and reserves, maintaining operational excellence across all Company activities, as well as conducting studies, innovation, and facility development to extend the mine’s lifespan.
Prospek dan Rencana ke Depan Prospect and Future Plans In mid-2024, PT Sumbawa Jutaraya (SJR), the  Company’s gold mining concession on Sumbawa  Island, West Nusa Tenggara, will start production.
Initial production capacity is expected to reach  25,000 troy ounces of dore bullion per year and can  reach optimal capacity of 65,000 troy ounces per year  by 2025.
SJR’s production rate will stabilize at around  65,000 troy ounces over 10 years, based on current  total reserves calculations.
Thus, cumulatively, PTAR  and SJR are expected to produce around 300,000  troy ounces of gold in the future.
Construction Industry Segment Construction industry still holds promising  prospects.
However, the impact of General Election  and government transition has led businesses to  adopt a wait-and-see approach at least until the  third quarter of 2024.
Despite this, there are still  construction sectors growing amid these conditions,  which present opportunities for ACSET, such as the  construction of modern warehouses, data centers,  hospitals, national toll road infrastructure, mining  civil works, and renewable energy civil works.
With operational excellence strategies and vertical  integration restructuring in the supply chain, ACSET  aims to achieve its 2030 aspiration as the ”Top of  Mind” for foundation, structure, and infrastructure  development.
