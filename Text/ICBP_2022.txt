Statement of Profit or Loss &  Other Comprehensive Income Net Sales ICBP continued to deliver a healthy sales  performance in 2022, registering consolidated net sales of Rp64.80 trillion which grew 14% from Rp56.80 trillion in 2021 driven by sales volume and ASP growth in both domestic and overseas markets.

However, gross margin declined to 33.6% from 35.7% in 2021 on higher raw material costs.
