The geopolitical conflicts that occurred in several  regions, which culminated in the Russian invasion to  Ukraine, had a huge impact on the world economy.
Prices for energy commodities, especially oil and gas,  have jumped significantly due to reduced supply.
These  conditions led to the disruption of global supply chains  so that the inflation rate also soared.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the World  Economic Outlook report published in February 2023  predicted global economic growth in 2022 only reached  3.2%, down quite drastically from the previous year of  6.0%.
The decline in economic growth was also followed  by soaring global inflation to a level of 8.8% from only  4.7% the previous year.
Responding to economic conditions throughout 2022,  the United States Central Bank (The Fed) adopted a  policy to raise the benchmark interest rate.
Throughout  2022, the Fed was noted to have raised interest rates  7 (seven) times in a row to 4.25%.
This means that  throughout 2022, The Fed’s interest rate has increased  by 425 bps because at the end of 2021, The Fed’s interest  rate was recorded at 0%.
The increase in The Fed’s policy interest rate amidst  the uncertainty of global conditions resulted in the  appreciation of the US Dollar against various currencies,  including Rupiah.
The average Rupiah exchange rate  was Rp14,850 per US Dollar in 2022, experienced a  weakening of around 3.8% compared to the average  exchange rate of Rp14,308 per US Dollar in 2021.
The Indonesian economy was also affected by the  various turmoils that occurred at the global level.
natural wealth, the Indonesian economy can still grow  quite well in 2022, namely by 5.31%, higher than the  previous year of 3.70%.
The relatively high economic growth in 2022 was mainly  contributed by an increase in household consumption  which was previously restrained during Covid-19.
In addition, Indonesia’s economic growth was also  supported by excellent export performance so that  in general, Indonesia’s trade balance experienced  a surplus of USD 54.46 billion.
This achievement was  recorded as the highest in history.
Improvement in the national economy was also  reflected in the performance of various business fields  and all regions which remained well.
This was driven by  improving domestic demand in line with the continued  increase in mobility and the continued completion of  the National Strategic Program (PSN).
However, Indonesia’s inflation rate in 2022 increased  significantly to 5.51% from 1.87% in the previous year.
This  was partly due to the increase in the price of subsidized  fuel oil by the Government in September 2022 due to  the soaring world crude oil prices as a result of the war  between Russia and Ukraine.
In addition, Indonesia’s  dependence on imports of wheat, soybeans, meat,  pharmaceuticals, energy, and high-tech machinery  also has an impact on rising inflation.
To reduce the inflation rate, Bank Indonesia (BI) took a  policy to raise the benchmark interest rate or BI 7-Day  Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) quite aggressively from  3.50% at the end of 2021 to 5.50% at the end of 2022 to  ensure that future core inflation returns to within the  3±1% target.
ENERGY INDUSTRY REVIEW In line with the process of national economic recovery,  the national energy demand has experienced a  significant increase.
This was due to an increase in  people’s mobility and economic activity which was  gradually recovering, having previously been held back  by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The main national energy sources still came from fossil  energy, namely oil and coal.
In line with the increase in  demand and coupled with the Russia-Ukraine war, oil  and coal prices experienced a sharp spike in 2022.
This  forced the government to adopt a policy to increase  subsidized fuel prices in September 2022 because the  burden of subsidies was too large.
However, amidst these conditions the utilization of New,  Renewable Energy (EBT) in the national energy mix until  2022 was not yet optimal.
Although it increased from the  previous year, the increase was still not optimal.
Until the  end of 2022, the use of EBT in the national energy mix has  only reached 14.11%, a slight increase from the realization  in 2021 which was 13.65%.
Under these conditions, the  NRE target in the National Energy General Plan (RUEN) of  23% in 2025 will be difficult to achieve if there is no policy  support from the government.
At the G20 Summit in Bali, last November 2022, the  government together with G20 member countries  announced an acceleration of the energy transition,  including ensuring the achievement of sustainable  global development targets, in 2030.
In particular for  access to reliable, sustainable, and affordable modern  energy for all.
The G20 Energy Ministers agreed on the “Bali Compact”,  which was the result of the Energy Transitions Ministerial  Meeting (ETMM), which contains nine principles.
“Bali  Compact” is an important part of accelerating the  energy transition.

Area Lumut Balai Realization of production equivalent to electricity in the  Lumut Balai Area in 2022 will reach 448.5 GWh, or 105%  of the RKAP of 427.33 GWh, due to electricity production  being optimally absorbed by PLN.
Sibayak Area PLTP Unit I and II belonging to PT Dizamatra Powerindo  were not operating because the condition of the main  equipment was not supportive, and not feasible to  operate, so the PLTP repairs were stopped, according to  PT Dizamatra Powerindo’s letter No.059/DP-SBY/III/2016.
Based on the above matters, PT Pertamina (Persero)  as the Company’s Shareholder has sent a Request for  a Legal Opinion to the Attorney General of the Republic  of Indonesia through Letter No. 690/M00000/2017-S0  dated October 30, 2017, on Issues related to the  Implementation of the Steam Sales Contract (SSC)/ Steam Sales/Purchase Agreement with PT Dizamatra  Powerindo.
This request was submitted because until  now the Company cannot utilize the steam produced  from the Sibayak Area, because according to the SSC  the steam can only be sold to PT Dizamatra Powerindo.
SEGMENT REVENUES The Company obtains revenue through: 1.
the Company’s own operations, which consist of  the sale of electricity and steam generated at PLTP  and steam wells to PLN and other IPPs based on  various ESC and PJBUs that have been signed by the  Company, and 2.
production allowances obtained from KOB  Contractors that the Company has contracted  to operate within the Company’s WKP, which  are usually worth 4% of the KOB Contractor’s net  operating revenues, except for operations carried  out by Star Energy Darajat which is 2.66% of its net  operating revenues.
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES In ensuring the availability of geothermal steam to  fulfill sales and purchase contracts and a sustainable  business, the Company carries out exploration and  development activities throughout the WKP according  to the business strategy in the Company’s Work Plan  and Budget (RKAP) and the Company’s Long-Term  Plan (RJPP).
Exploration activities consist of geoscience  studies (geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and  geomatics and start with surveying, processing,  modeling, analysis, evaluation, interpretation of  geoscience data, and exploration drilling until a project  is ready to generate electricity.
