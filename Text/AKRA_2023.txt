ECONOMIC AND  INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Global and National Economic Analysis The global economy has been gradually recovering over  the past three years from the crisis that impacted the world.
As per the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its January  2024 World Economic Outlook Update, global economic  growth is estimated at 3.1% in 2023 and is anticipated to  remain the same in 2024, with growth of 3.2% expected  in 2025.
Forecasted global economic growth, however, remains  below the level achieved during the period of 2000-2019,  which averaged 3.8%.
Tensions arising from events such  as the Russia-Ukraine war, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,  extreme weather conditions, and increased monetary  policy tightening compared to previous times could  potentially have adverse effects on supply chains and the  long-term economic outlook.
The impact of supply chain disruptions led to notable  levels of inflation in 2023, although it decreased against  2022 from 8.7% to 6.9%.
Consequently, the Federal Reserve  responded by increasing the benchmark interest rate to  5.25-5.50%, the highest rate seen in decades.
The rise in benchmark interest rates amid uncertainty has  led to uneven economic growth, with European countries,  China, and low-income nations falling behind compared  to North America and major Asian countries.
Amidst the challenges posed by global economic  conditions, Indonesia’s economy maintained its robust  growth.
According to the Bank Indonesia Report for the  fourth quarter of 2023, the domestic economy expanded  by 0.3% from 5.2% in 2022 to 5.5% in 2023, driven by  rising consumption, electoral activities, and increased  investment, particularly in infrastructure projects such  as the Capital City of the Archipelago (IKN), part of the  National Strategy Projects (PSN).
As of December 31, 2023, domestic inflation was reported  to be well-managed, marking the lowest rate in the past  two decades.
According to Indonesia’s Coordinating  Ministry for Economic Affairs, inflation stood at 2.61% (year- on-year), showing a decrease compared to 2022’s rate  of 5.51% (year-on-year).
The core component of inflation  registered at 1.80% (year-on-year), maintaining stability  albeit in a declining trend.
Industry Analysis and Company Position in the Industry Deceleration in economic growth led to fluctuations in  global crude oil prices in 2023, where, by the end of the first  quarter, Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices  had decreased by 7.92% and 7.33% respectively.
The imminent risk of recession has compelled crude  oil-producing nations, particularly members of the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and  their Allies (OPEC+), such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, to  curtail their production in a bid to stabilize the oil market.
This decision led to a reduction in global oil inventories and  impacted the volatility of global oil prices throughout the  entirety of 2023.
Oil price fluctuations globally have a direct impact on  Indonesia, given its status as a net oil importer.
The  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) reports  that Indonesia continues to import approximately 35% of  its daily petroleum oil requirement, which ranges from 1.3  to 1.4 million barrels.
Consequently, increases in global oil  prices also influence domestic petroleum prices.
As a petroleum distribution company, AKR has effectively  pass through the oil price, due to the formula based  pricing based on Mean of Platts Singapore.
Consequently,  the Company’s oil supply and prices are less affected by  the fluctuations caused by the pandemic or geopolitical  tensions.
Fluctuations in petroleum prices, combined with the  government’s initiative to promote clean energy adoption in  industry and transportation, have motivated the Company  to participate in biodiesel distribution nationwide.
AKR is  involved in receiving biodiesel shipments as part of the  B35 program implemented in 2023.
To support the adoption of clean energy nationwide,  the Company initiated efforts within the Java Integrated  Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE) industrial area through a  Joint Venture (JV), focusing on supplying natural gas and  utilizing JIIPE gas to meet the increasing demand for clean  energy.104 Annual Report 2023 OPERATIONAL  OVERVIEW Business Segments Served by the Company The Company and its subsidiaries were managing four  operating segments at the end of 2023: 1.
Trade and Distribution: The distribution of petroleum  products and various basic chemicals, such as caustic  soda, sodium sulphate, PVC resin, and soda ash. 2.
Services & Logistics: A range of logistics services,  including storage tank and warehouse rental, packing  services, loading and unloading, and transportation  services.
These services mainly cater to liquid and solid  chemical products in Indonesia, as well as petroleum.3.

This decrease can be attributed  mainly to lower oil and chemical prices compared to  2022, although the Company’s business model effectively  transfers these lower prices to consumers.
The industrial estate sector contributed 5.5%, marking  a substantial rise of 102% compared to the prior year’s  contribution of 2.4%.
This was petroleumed by considerable  land sales in 2023, totaling 91 hectares.
In 2023, the logistics segment contributed 1.9%, growing  by 11% compared to 2.4% in 2022.
This significant growth  was due to the high utilization rate of the Company’s  third-party logistics fleet, with high consumer demand.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing segment experienced  a 30% decline in revenue, and the contribution declined  from 1.7% to 1.3% in 2023.

Product Revenue of Trading & Distribution Segment in Bilion Rupiah 31,86936,327 18,953 4,759 2023 2022 20216,344Petroleum Basic Chemical Petroleum Oil The Company only carries out business activities in the  distribution sector.
Therefore, there is no production data  that can be reported.
Petroleum distribution is generally divided into:  1.
Non-subsidized biodiesel and other petroleum products  for industrial customers;  2.
Subsidized biodiesel for retail customers with quotas  allocated by the Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory  Agency (BPH Migas);  3.
nonsubsidized petroleum and non-petroleum services  for retail customers; and  4.
In response to the requirements of petroleum distribution  across the Indonesian archipelago, the Company has  established a robust business model with an efficient  mechanism to tackle economic and geopolitical  challenges.
This includes adapting to fluctuations in global  oil prices and currency exchange rates, which are then  adjusted and passed on to customers.
Additionally, the  Company has implemented a risk management system  based on prudent principles and maintains effectiveness  in managing net open positions.
The Company guarantees that essential petroleum  products are delivered promptly and efficiently to all  industrial customers located throughout the Indonesian  archipelago.
A robust logistics network and an extensive  supply chain, which includes ports, storage terminals,  and transportation facilities equipped with IT monitoring  systems, play a vital role in facilitating the Company’s  successful distribution efforts.
In addressing variations in petroleum prices and in  alignment with government directives mandating the use  of biodiesel across industrial and transportation sectors to  bolster trade balance and support the local Crude Palm  Oil (CPO) industry, AKR played a role in the achievement  of the B35 program, which involved blending diesel with  alternative petroleums, contributing to its success.
For 11 consecutive years, AKR has earned the government’s  trust to distribute specific types of subsidized petroleum.
Between 2018 and 2022, the Company was designated a  P3JBT agent by BPH Migas.
These outlets are equipped  with a technology system capable of monitoring the  products from the feeding tank or dispenser nozzle to the  customer, a digital monitoring system utilized to oversee  the distribution of subsidized diesel, ensuring it reaches  the intended consumers as per target requirements.
The Company partnered with bp Global to form a joint  venture (JV) aimed at building an nonsubsidized retail  petroleum network in Indonesia.
At the end of 2023, the  JV had launched 10 new outlets, bringing the total to 46  gas stations situated in Jabodetabek, Surabaya, Gresik,  Malang, and Toll Rest Areas.
The majority of these outlets  are Company Owned and Company Operated (COCO),  with a substantial presence of Dealer Owned and Dealer  Operated (DODO) outlets as well.
The Indonesian government is steadfast in its commitment  to phase out low-octane petroleum as part of its Net- Zero target.
This is accompanied by a shift in consumer  preferences towards higher-grade products.
To meet  market demands, AKR, through its joint venture (JV),  offers superior-quality petroleums, while the retail outlets  provide an enhanced customer experience by offering  non-petroleum services such as beverages, mini markets,  vehicle light maintenance facilities, and ample parking  space.106 Annual Report 2023 Petroleum Oil Sales in bilions of Rupiah In 2023, the Company’s petroleum sales amounted to Rp31,869 billion, or a decrease of 12% from Rp36,327 billion in 2022.

COMPARISON OF TARGET  AND REALIZATION AKR established several targets to reach at the start of 2023.
A comparison between the targets set and the actual  accomplishments for the fiscal year 2023 follows: Description 2023 Realization Target 2023 Net profit +16% +14% - +16% Trading and distribution segment gross profit growth -5% +5-6% Industrial Estate land sales (Hectares) 91 75 Sales and Revenue AKR operates a passthrough business model in its  petroleum trading and distribution segment, adopting a  commission-based model for the basic chemical trading  and distribution segment.
The trading and distribution  segment significantly contributes to revenue and aligns  its selling prices with international price standards or  benchmarks.
The Company demonstrates efficient pricing  strategies by passing on product prices to consumers  effectively, and its performance remains unaffected by  fluctuations in product prices.
As a result, the Company did not set a revenue target  for 2023.
Despite a decline in revenue by 11% to Rp42.087  billion in 2023, gross profit and net profit increased.
The  Company focused on achieving net profit growth for 2023  by estimating the volume of products to be distributed and  the associated margins, in addition to aiming for a specific  amount of land sales in the Industrial estate segment.
Net Profit The net profit achieved in 2023 amounted to Rp2.780  billion, a 16% increase compared to Rp2.403 billion in 2022  and aligning with the target set for 2023.
This growth was  primarily attributed to the successful maintenance of  the trading and distribution segment’s performance as  planned, along with the industrial estate segment selling  91 hectares of land, surpassing the management’s target  of 75 hectares for 2023.
Net profit growth can be attained through several  strategies, such as: 1.
Sustaining profitability levels and ensuring high  service quality and safety standards in the trading and  distribution segments. 2.
Promoting the JIIPE industrial estate as a special  economic zone with a range of incentives, both fiscal  and non-fiscal, to attract investors and encourage  investment in JIIPE.
Investment Type Investment ObjectiveInvestment Value (IDR Billion) Office Equipment Operational Support 8 Ship Fleet Capacity Improvement 148 Assets under Construction Construction of Vessel and Tank Facilities 313 Total Investment 933130 Annual Report 2023 2024  PROJECTION Bank Indonesia forecasts Indonesia’s economic growth to  expand throughout 2024, ranging from 4.7% to 5.5%.
This  projection marks an improvement from the estimated  economic growth in 2023, which was around 5.05%.
The  growth acceleration is attributed to rising household  consumption, bolstered by higher minimum wages and  government social assistance.
Additionally, increased  government spending, petroleumed by preparations  for the general elections and higher infrastructure  investments, contributed to the growth momentum.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation target for 2024  is set at 2.5% ± 1%, which represents a decrease compared  to the 2022 projection of 3% ± 1%.
To manage inflation  effectively, the government has implemented consistent  monetary and fiscal policies, with a particular focus on  controlling food prices and overall inflation expectations.
In 2023, the government ramped up the adoption of  biopetroleum blends, including the relaunch of the B35  program, which involves increasing the percentage of  biodiesel in petroleum blends to promote the utilization of  New Renewable Energy (EBT) sources.
AKR is among the companies actively contributing to  fulfilling the demand for biodiesel and petroleum oil.
In  2023, AKR received a biodiesel allocation of 899,125 kiloliters (kL) as per the Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources (ESDM) of the Republic of Indonesia No. 205.
This allocation aligns with the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) target of achieving  a biodiesel utilization of 12.5 million kiloliters (kL) by 2024.
The anticipated rise in biodiesel demand, coupled with the  overall growth in the petroleum trading and distribution  business, has instilled confidence in the Company to  target a gross profit growth of 6-8% in both the trading  and industrial segments.
Furthermore, the demand for  basic chemicals, driven by the increasing requirement  for smelters as part of the government’s mining sector  downstream program, also contributes to this projection.
In the industrial estate segment, JIIPE experienced  significant growth in 2023, with land sales realization  reaching 90 hectares, surpassing the projected target  of 70-75 hectares.
The growing number of tenants  from industrial and business sectors has contributed to  increased demand for utilities such as electricity, water,  and gas, as well as from the port sector.
Additionally, the  strong demand for smelters as part of the downstream  mining industry is anticipated to enhance the appeal to  both domestic and foreign investors.
The Company recorded business projections for 2024, as  follows: Description 2023 Realization Target 20242024 Target  against Net profit +16% +12-15% +12-15% Trading and distribution segment gross profit growth -5% +6-8% +6-8% Industrial Estate land sales (Hectares) 91 130 +43% Sales and Earnings In the industrial estate segment, KEK JIIPE has recorded  significant growth in 2023, with land sales realization  reaching 90 hectares, surpassing the projected target  of 70-75 hectares.
The growing number of tenants  from industrial and business sectors has contributed to  increased demand for utilities such as electricity, water,  and gas, as well as from the port sector.
Additionally, the  strong demand for smelters as part of the downstream  mining industry is anticipated to enhance the appeal to  both domestic and foreign investors.
Net Profit The Company set a high net profit growth target for  gross and operating profit.
A smoothly running IT  infrastructure provides support for higher productivity,  which can minimize expenses.
The Company’s working  capital management is efficient, with the aim of reducing  financial costs.
Capital Structure In 2024, the Company does not intend to make substantial  alterations to its capital structure or modify its capital  structure policy.
As of December 31, 2023, equity comprised  79% of the total capital, amounting to Rp14,043 billion, and  the cash balance stood at IDR6,536 billion, with the net  gearing ratio indicating a net cash position of -0.16x.

*Before stock split 1:5 in 2022132 Annual Report 2023 BUSINESS  OUTLOOK Prospects for Petroleum Trade & Distribution The Company employs a robust business model to manage  its petroleum distribution, adaptable to market demands  by utilizing the formula based pricing based on Mean of  Platts Singapore (MOPS) to maintain price stability, the  Company passes-through fluctuations in global oil prices  and currency exchange rates to customers, aiming to  achieve a zero or negligible net open position.
In 2023, the distribution of petroleum to industrial and  business customers experienced growth, primarily  petroleumed by increased industrial activity in eastern  Indonesia associated with the mineral downstream  program.
The Company anticipates this upward trend to  continue in 2024. 1.
Mining The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources aims for  coal production to reach 710 million tons, higher than  the 2023 target of 695 million tons, driving petroleum  demand, particularly for mining companies with  pre-stripping capabilities, leading to a higher mine  production stripping ratio.
Several mineral mines are  intensifying their mining activities in response to  growing demand for raw materials like nickel, bauxite,  and others, propelled by the government’s downstream  program.
Nickel mining companies in Indonesia have  announced plans to boost production in 2024. 2.
Smelter The value addition in the mining sector creates a  demand for petroleum products and chemicals.
Law  No. 3 of 2020 on the Amendment to Law No. 4 of  2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining mandates that raw  materials should not be exported.
The downstream  program encourages using raw materials to produce  advanced products with higher added value.
Minerals  such as copper, nickel, gold, tin, bauxite, and aluminum  must be smelted before obtaining an export permit.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources targets  the operation of 30 nickel smelters by 2024, with 13  already operating and 17 under construction, bringing  the total to 53 operational smelters by 2024.3.
Plantation Domestic consumption of crude palm oil (CPO)  is expected to rise in 2024.
In 2023, national CPO  consumption was projected to reach 23.28 million  tons, up from 21.14 million tons in 2022.
The Executive  Director of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI),  Mukti Sardjono, stated that CPO consumption in 2024  is estimated to increase by around 9.08% to 25.40  million tons.
The demand for food, biodiesel, and  oleochemicals will rise, especially with the B35 biodiesel  mandate driving a significant increase in local CPO  consumption.
The government plans to increase the  biodiesel mandate from B35 to B40 and potentially B45. 4.
Bunkering Services (Petroleum Delivery &  Transportation Services) Mining and fisheries bunkers rely on petroleum from  AKR.
The growth prospects for petroleum sales in  mining bunkers align with the mining industry’s  outlook.
Meanwhile, petroleum supply for fisheries  bunkers depends on factors affecting fishing activities  such as weather conditions, location, and regulatory  policies in the marine and fisheries sector. 5.
General Market Increased economic activity will lead to broad demand  for products distributed by the Company, including  those in the manufacturing, trading, construction, and  transportation sectors 6.
Power Plant The Company supplies petroleum to both government  and private power plants as required. 7.
Retail Company The Company sees significant potential in the retail  sector, with a relatively low ratio of gas stations to  Indonesia’s population and a rising number of motorized  vehicles each year.
The retail business is conducted  through AKR Retail Outlets and AKR-bp joint venture  outlets.
AKR-bp aims to operate 46 outlets by 2023 and  is targeting to operate up to 50 more gas stations by  2024.
Additionally, the government’s policy to align the  selling price of RON 92 petroleum with market prices is  expected to boost volumes significantly in the coming  years.4.
PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (PEFINDO) reaffirmed the ratings for the Company and AKR’s 2017 sustainable bonds  I phase I Series C as idAA (double A) with a Stable Outlook in the Rating Certificate issued on March 13, 2024.

Until 2023, PT Dirgantara Petroindo Jaya, a  joint venture between AKR and Air BP, manages the  Company’s aviation petroleum sales activities.
Prospects for Basic Chemicals Trading & Distribution The Company is aiming for sustained financial growth in  2024, building upon achievements in 2023.
This optimism  is boosted by positive prospects in the basic chemical  industry, as well as the petroleum distribution to the  JIIPE Special Economic Zone (KEK JIIPE) project, which is  experiencing favorable growth trends.
The demand for basic chemicals like caustic soda and  other chemicals used across multiple industries, including  smelters, is on the rise.
This trend is expected to persist  throughout 2024, driven by the ongoing progress in  mining’s downstreaming initiatives.
Manufacturing Outlook The Company’s manufacturing sector overseen by Aruki is  significantly impacted by the property market and timber  industry in Indonesia, with an expected growth in furniture  and craft exports.
The Indonesian Furniture and Handicraft  Industry Association (HIMKI) aims for exports to reach  USD 5 billion by 2024.
With this target in mind, Aruki, as a  subsidiary of AKR, is anticipated to have a more optimistic  outlook regarding the domestic property and furniture  market.
Logistics Outlook The Company anticipates an increase in third-party  logistics revenue in 2024 due to significant investments  in vessels, trucks, and enhanced efficiency to cater to  the Eastern Indonesia market.
The Company boasts  comprehensive logistics and supply chain facilities, with a  total of 17 operational ports as of 2023. 1.
Petroleum Storage & Transportation Tanks Government policies promoting the downstreaming  of mineral mines in 2023 have spurred demand for  petroleum and biopetroleum, expected to continue  in 2024.
This surge necessitates increased liquid bulk  distribution and storage facilities.
The Company utilizes  14 ships, barges, and Self Propelled Oil Barges (SPOB)  for petroleum distribution, continuously expanding  this fleet to enhance service quality and strengthen  AKR’s logistics and supply chain.
Land distribution is  managed by AKR Transport Indonesia (ATI) with a fleet of 229 trucks. 2.
Jakarta Tank Terminal (JTT) With a storage capacity of 350,000 cubic meters (cbm),  JTT anticipates continued growth in capacity utilization  to meet escalating petroleum demand.
Located in  Jakarta, JTT primarily serves the import and distribution  market in Jakarta and Java Island. 3.
Bulk and Containers The Company’s dry bulk and container loading/ unloading operations are overseen by its subsidiary,  Usaha Era Pratama Nusantara (UEPN), situated in  Surabaya.
PT Berlian Manyar Sejahtera (BMS) manages  port services at Manyar Terminal in Gresik Port, East  Java, holding a 76-year concession from the Ministry  of Transportation.
BMS’s capacity expanded to handle  up to 5.4 million metric tons per year in 2022.
Currently,  BMS is extending its jetty to support the copper smelter  facility at JIIPE Gresik, expanding from 2 to 4 points.
Prospects for Industrial Estates The JIIPE Gresik Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was  founded in 2013, a realization of the AKR’s vision to  enhance connectivity for businesses in Indonesia.
The  project spans 3,000 hectares and encompasses Industrial  Estates, Deep Sea Ports, and Residential Estates.
JIIPE,  with comprehensive facilities such as integrated industrial  estates and ports, water supply with minimal runoff,  telecommunications services, and connectivity with land  transportation, including in-house power plants.
In 2024, JIIPE’s income is expected to be derived primarily  from three sources.
Firstly, land sales revenue is projected,  with 850 hectares of land available to be monetized.
Secondly, there will be increased demand for electricity,  water, and gas, particularly from copper and glass smelters  within the zone.
Lastly, income from port operations,  capable of handling 10 million tons of bulk cargo, will  contribute to JIIPE’s revenue streams.
Alongside contributions from the trading and distribution  business, which historically have been the highest  contributor to AKR, the KEK JIIPE industrial estate and  port are forecasted to account for 22% of AKR’s gross profit  in 2024.
This contribution is expected to increase to 32%  by 2030.
In 2024, the Company anticipates increased revenue from  JIIPE, driven by two main factors: 1.
Land sales to heavy industries from both foreign and  domestic investors. 2.
Increased revenue from the utilities segment, including  the sale of electricity, water, and other utilities.
This  growth is expected as major tenants like the copper  smelter, glass factory, and advanced copper products  factory commence operations.134 Annual Report 2023 DIVIDEND POLICY AND DISTRIBUTION Dividend Policy Chronology of Dividend DistributionAccording to the Initial Public Offering prospectus in 1994, AKR has a policy of distributing cash dividends to all shareholders  at least once a year.
