EXPANDING OUR HORIZONS 2023 Annual Report PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk21Over the past  five years, due  to successful  acquisitions,  targeted  exploration, good  operatorship and  good governance,  MedcoEnergi  has been able  to deliver  significant  growth in scale,  profitability  and shareholder  returns.
In 2023 MedcoEnergi met all of our  operational guidance, for oil & gas  production, power sales, unit costs, capital  expenditure and debt reduction.
We also  increased our cash dividend, exceeded  financial expectations, extended the  Corridor PSC, closed the Block 60 and  Block 48 Oman acquisitions, met our  reduction targets for Green House Gas  emissions, two years ahead of plan and  improved our ESG rating.
Finally, of  course the Amman IPO was executed in  July, the largest Indonesian IPO of the  year.
Generally, oil prices in 2023 were  again supportive, although around   US$20/bbl below 2022 levels.
Brent  averaged around US$83/bbl in 2023  and despite the unstable geopolitical  environment in the Middle East, prices  were less volatile than in 2022.
Brent  opened 2023 at US$82/bbl, peaked  in late September at US$98/bbl,  before declining to exit 2023 at around   US$78/bbl.
In line with this MedcoEnergi’s  average realized liquids prices in  2023 were US$78/bbl compared to   US$96/bbl in 2022.
Our commodity- linked gas price fell to US$9.9/mmbtu  from US$11.6/mmbtu in 2022.
Fixed  gas prices were US$5.9/mmbtu versus  US$6.8/mmbtu in 2022, and the  consolidated average realized gas price  decreased to US$7.0/mmbtu from  US$8.2/mmbtu in 2022.
Interest rates in 2023 in Indonesia and the  United States continued their steady rise,  with the Fed Funds rate ending the year  at 5.5%, up from the 4.5% at the end of  2022.
Expectations for 2024 are that the  Fed may be able to cut interest rates in the  second half of the year and central banks  around the world will then begin to follow.
In 2023 MedcoEnergi net Finance Charges  were US$226 million, up US$7 million from  the US$220 million in 2022.
The modest rise in net Finance Charges year on year  despite drawing US$470 million to close  the acquisition of the Oman blocks was  the result of continued multi-year debt  repayments and bond buybacks.
Consolidated debt closed the year up  US$144 million from US$3,151 million  in 2022.
In 2023, we secured a new   US$350 million financing facility, a  US$300 million amortizing loan, and  successfully issued a US$500 million  USD Bond.
The proceeds from these  financings were used to close the Oman  acquisition, repay maturing debt and  accelerate our deleveraging strategy  through capped tender offers which  retired US$425 million of USD notes.
NET INCOME AND EBITDA  Mainly as a result of the reduced  commodity prices 2023 EBITDA  decreased to US$1,255 million, down  from the US$1,593 million in 2022.
Net Income also fell to US$331  million, a drop of US$200 million from   US$531 million in 2022.
The Company’s  share of AMMN Net Income in 2023 was   US$55 million, down US$198 million from  the US$253 million in 2022 because of  the unprecedented flooding at the mine  site and a delay in the renewal of AMMN  export permit.
Our Oil & Gas Net Income  continued to be underpinned by our  fixed prices contracts, a strength of the  Company, and these performed strongly.
Net Income was also affected by several  non-cash items.
DD&A charges in 2023  were US$108 million below 2022, due  to additional reserves added in 2023,  mainly at the Corridor and Natuna Blocks  following the signing of new long term gas  contracts.
The IPO of AMMN in July was a  great success and resulted in a dilution gain  of US$84 million.
The bargain purchase  from Oman acquisition was US$36 million,  largely from the continued higher price  environment since the acquisition.
Financial   Review 2023 Annual Report PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk 22 Company  ProfileBusiness  Activities2023 PerformanceSustainability Corporate Governance Attachment Management Discussion and AnalysisThere was also a fair value gain of US$24 million at DSLNG  because of higher reserves from its supplying fields.
However,  continued challenges at the Block A gas plant resulted in  an impairment of US$59 million, and a further write-off of US$44 million of VAT which is unlikely to be recovered  under the current PSC rules.
We also took the decision to  sell our Libya asset which resulted in a further write down of   US$50 million.

Total capital spending in Oil & Gas was   US$261 million, in line with guidance of US$250 million.
Capital  spending in Medco Power was slightly below guidance of  US$80 million, mainly due to the divestment of the Sumbawa   Regas project.
In 2023, we were pleased to make final investment decisions  for the 34 MW Ijen Geothermal plant, the 25 MWp East  Bali solar PV installation and the add-on combined cycle  39 MW project at Energi Listrik Batam which will use waste  heat to increase generating capacity.
These three projects  demonstrate our firm commitment to the energy transition  and our sustainability.
Construction is ahead of schedule on  all three projects.

The total final  dividend for 2022 was US$65 million, approximately  IDR 38 per share, higher than guidance of Rp15-20 per share.
Despite the lower prices in 2023, the Company  was able to increase its interim cash dividend.
In 2023  MedcoEnergi paid a US$40 million final dividend for  2022 and a US$25 million interim dividend for 2023.
The  final 2023 dividend will be recommended at the AGMS  in May 2024.

This is the right thing to do for  society and the environment.
It is also for good business by  facilitating access to competitive capital markets and debt.
Stakeholders recognize that we meet our sustainability and  ESG commitments, which we set in line with global standards  and best practices.
Our relationships within the finance  providers remain positive and productive.
The outlook for 2024 is positive with an improving macro  environment in commodity prices and the prospect of lower  interest rates.
We are on track to fully repay the Corridor  acquisition debt by mid-2024.
MedcoEnergi’s strategy  remains to deleverage quickly and absent the December  draw of the Oman acquisition debt we delivered on the  commitment to reduce debt down to 2018 levels, the same  debt as prior to the Ophir acquisition in 2019.
The Company  has achieved significant growth in scale profitability and  liquidity since 2018.
We have delivered sharp increases in  shareholder returns through successful acquisitions, targeted  exploration, good operatorship, and good governance.
We  will continue to do so.
