The Company’s operating segment is divided  into 4 (four) operating segments to describe the  Company’s and Subsidiaries’ business activities.
This segment  distributes petroleum  products and various  types of basic  chemicals such as  caustic soda, sodium  sulfate, PVC resin and  soda ash.
This segment  provides various  logistics services  including rental  of storage tanks  and warehouse,  packing services,  handling charges  and transportation  services, especially  for liquid and solid  chemical products  in Indonesia and  petroleum products  in Indonesia.
This segment  produces adhesive  materials by the  subsidiary, Aruki.
This segment of  the Group is under  BKMS, an indirect  subsidiary of the  Company through  UEPN.
The Trading and Distribution segment is the largest contributor to  the revenue, with 92% in 2020 (93.1% in 2019).
Revenue is heavily  dependent on international prices of oil and selective chemicals  like Caustic Soda, Soda Ash etc.
In 2020, international oil and  chemicals declined resulting in a 19.7% decline in segment  revenue and 18.4% decline in overall Company revenue.
Logistic  services had 0.8% revenue growth and its share of total revenue  increased from 4% to 5%.
Manufacturing revenue declined by  15.1% compared to 2019, mainly due to lower ASP .
Its contribution  to revenue was relatively unchanged at 2%.
Revenue from industrial estate segment (JIIPE) had a strong 21%  growth from 2019.
Its share to overall revenues increased to 2%  from 1%.
This segment delivers high gross margin and has much  higher share of gross profit.
The growth in revenue and income  from JIIPE was delivered by higher land sales and lease income.
JIIPE attractiveness has been increasing due to its unique features,  designation as a National Strategic Project by the Indonesian  Government and approval for Special Economic Zone status by  relevant authorities.
Petroleum The Company’s business activities are limited to distribution only.
Therefore, there is no data to report on production process and  capacity.
The distribution is broadly segmented into: 1) Non-subsidized  petroleum to industrial customers, 2) Subsidized petroleum  (diesel) to retail investors with quota allocated by the Oil and  Gas Downstream Regulatory Agency (BPH Migas) and 3) Non- subsidized petroleum and non-fuel services to retail customers.
Industrial non-subsidized petroleum is distributed to customers  across a broad range of industries and sectors.2018 2019 202022.428 5.288 17.140 15.741 12.86520.200 4.45916.219 3.354 Kimia Dasar Basic ChermicalsBBM Petroleum 114 Laporan Tahunan Annual Report  2020 PT AKR Corporindo Tbk ANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN  Management Discussion And AnalysisTETAP FOKUS DALAM SITUASI YANG MENANTANG Remaining Focused in Challenging TimesPada tahun 2017, Perseroan dan BP Global telah mendirikan  perusahaan Joint Venture (JV) untuk mengembangkan BBM ritel  nonsubsidi di Indonesia.
Grab-Car Branding; 5.
In 2017, the Company and BP Global established a Joint  Venture (JV) company to develop and grow non-subsidized  retail petroleum in Indonesia.
The first BP-AKR gas station at De  Latinos-Serpong was opened in November 2018, followed by  the 2nd gas station at Jababeka-Cikarang, and then at Cibubur,  Bintaro.
As of 2020, there were 16 BP-AKR gas stations that have  been operating in the Jabodetabek, Surabaya, and toll rest areas.
Currently the development of the bp service station is included  in the DODO (Dealer Owned Dealer Operated) agreement.
The  Company has targeted to open more retail outlets in Indonesia in  the future, with an initial focus on big cities such as Jabodetabek,  Bandung and Surabaya.
The Company has been entrusted by the government for nine  consecutive years to distribute certain types of subsidized fuel.
In November 2017, BPH Migas assigned AKRA as a P3JBT agent  for 5 years to distribute subsidized diesel for the period of 2018- 2022.
AKR has 132 operational outlets dedicated to distributing  subsidized diesel fuel.
The operating outlets are equipped with  a technology system to monitor the products distribution from  storage tanks or from dispenser nozzles to customers.
A digital  monitoring system is used to control the distribution of subsidized  diesel fuel so that it reaches target consumers.
Indonesian customers are gradually shifting from using the  subsidized low-octane gasoline to the non-subsidized-high- octane-gasoline.
This is resulting in higher growth in the use of the  latter.
To capture this shift in market trend, AKR in 2016 introduced  AKRA 92 gasoline products for its own outlets.
The joint venture  with BP is also part of this strategy.
In 2020 BP-AKR Retail performance was as per plans.
Even though  it was impacted by the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB),  currently the sales volume has rebounded to the level of before  the Covid-19 period.
This business offers quality petroleum  combined with comprehensive services (non-petroleum) to  provide the best experience for customers.
The sales from BP- AKR outlets have almost returned to pre-pandemic levels with a  steady growth rate every month.
The marketing activities in 2020  were made to increase public knowledge of BP-AKR retail through  various channels: 1.
Loyalty Points (PONTA); 2.
Promotion of NFR/Non-Fuel Revenue (Non-Petrol); 3.
Grab-Car Branding; 5.
Targeted digital media & influencer marketing through  mobile advertisements, 6.

The stated objective is  to improve Trade Balance and support the domestic CPO industry.
AKR has been supporting this Biofuel policy since its inception.
In  2020, the Company has been reappointed to distribute B30 and  became a private company with the largest FAME quota.
As a distributor of petroleum products across the Indonesian  archipelago, the Company has developed a robust business  model whereby the company has efficient mechanisms to  overcome economic fluctuations, where changes in world  oil prices and currency exchange rate are passed through to  customers.
The Company has a prudent risk management system  and manages the net open position effectively.
Petroleum Sales The Company’s petroleum sales in 2020 of Rp12,865 billion were  18% lower from Rp15,741 billion in 2019 in line with decreases  in sales price.
The contribution of petroleum distribution to the Company’s  consolidated sales and revenues was 73% in 2020.
Basic Chemicals  The Company’s basic chemicals business is only trading and  distribution activity.
Therefore, there is no data to report on  production or capacity.
The Company serves as a distributor  in Indonesia for domestic and international basic chemical  manufacturers.
Basic chemical products are the raw materials  needed by a large number of industries, such as chemicals,  textiles, pulp and paper, consumer goods, fertilizers, plywood and  refined wood products, food, pharmaceuticals, alumina etc.
Basic Chemical Sales Basic chemical sales were Rp3,354 billion in 2020, lower by 25%  from Rp4,459 billion in 2019.
The revenue decline was both due  to lower volumes and selling prices.
The decline in sales volume  is in line with reduced demand for chemicals as a number of  customers have had to reduce production or delay expansion  due to the impact of the pandemic.
Basic chemical sales in  2020 contributed 19% to the Company’s consolidated sales and  revenue.
Despite lower revenue in the trading and distribution segment,  the gross profit from this segment grew by 6% and gross margin  was up from 8% in 2019 to 10% in 2020.
This is because the  Company operates on a formula-based pricing where changes in  product prices are passed on to the customers.
In 2020, the Company strived to improve the efficiency,  effectiveness of operation and risk management, to grow profit  and increase competitiveness.
MANUFACTURING As of 2020, the Company only has one subsidiary engaged in the  manufacturing business segment, PT Arjuna Utama Kimia (Aruki)  which produces wood adhesives in Surabaya.

There was no  additional production capacity during 2020.
Adhesives Sales Aruki’s sales decreased from Rp443 billion in 2019 to Rp376  billion in 2020, down by 15%.
This was mainly due to the decrease  in ASP .
Lower revenue was more than offset by Improved efficiencies and  strict control over costs.
The 2020 gross profit increased 18% with  27% gross profit margin.
LOGISTIC SERVICES The Company provides an integrated logistics service to third  party customers in major ports across Indonesia.
This covers port  operations, transportation, rental of storage tanks, warehouses  and others.

Outlook of Manufacturing Aruki’s growth is related to the furniture industry in Java &  Indonesia.
Although domestic demand is not as good as the  export market, the Indonesian furniture industry is ready to meet  changing consumer patterns during the adaptation period to  new habits.
This is evidenced by stretching sales of furniture or  furniture in East Java, which have begun to show an increase  in demand.
This condition was triggered by the lifting of the  lockdown policy to face the Covid-19 pandemic by several export  destination countries.
Business players in the furniture sector are  optimistic that manufacturing utilization will return to normal by  the end of Q1 2021.
The majority of export destination countries for East Java furniture  are the United States, Japan, and England, as well as countries in  Europe, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium  153 Laporan Tahunan Annual Report  2020 PT AKR Corporindo Tbk Prospek Logistik  Pemerintah Indonesia telah menetapkan penurunan biaya  logistik sebagai salah satu prioritas.

and Italy.
Most imports of furniture products come from China.
The Minister of Trade, Muhammad Lutfi, predicts that the furniture  industry will have bright prospects in 2021, particularly in the  market share of developed countries such as the United States.
This  is supported by the increasing demand for home furniture after  the new habit of working from home which increases the demand  for home decor, crafts and furniture.
In addition, it is supported  by the decline in the main players in the furniture industry in the  US market because the status of exported wood does not meet  the requirements.
The improvement in the performance of the  furniture industry is also supported by the existence of an online  trading platform for furniture/crafts products that is increasingly  being used.
In 2021, Aruki targets revenue growth to revert to historic levels.
Cost efficiency to achieve optimal profit will be the main target  in 2021. 154 Laporan Tahunan Annual Report  2020 PT AKR Corporindo Tbk ANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN  Management Discussion And AnalysisTETAP FOKUS DALAM SITUASI YANG MENANTANG Remaining Focused in Challenging Times  2.

Assessment Conducted by Manag  AKR Management regularly monitors the performance of the  Company.
Monitoring is carried out jointly with the Board of  Commissioners and the Audit Committee.
Based on the results of  the monitoring, AKR Management concluded that the Company  is still in a very good position and has great potential to continue  to grow.
Business Development Potential  The Company still has enormous potential for continuously  growth In the petroleum segment, with the strength in logistics  infrastructure which is further strengthened by a partnership with  BP for retail and aviation fuel, the Company sees a positive outlook  for the growth of petroleum volumes in the current segment and  new segment.
In the retail sector, the Company will continue to encourage the  development of its gas station network.
The Company believes  that the retail sector has a huge potential.
Currently, the ratio of  the number of gas stations compared to Indonesian population  is still very low.
Besides, the increase in the number of vehicles  every year is also quite high.
To that end, the Company will  continue to encourage the development of a gas station network,  both gas stations that use the AKR brand (subsidized fuel and  non-subsidized fuel) as well as BP-AKR brand (specifically non- subsidized fuel).
In addition, the Indonesian economy is predicted to continue  improving in the coming years and increase people’s purchasing  power meaning the economy will be moving forward.
This is an  opportunity for the Company to boost the sales volume of basic  chemicals and petroleum.
In the basic chemicals segment, the  Company is also working with Petronas to further develop the  basic chemical market in Indonesia.
AKR will continue to develop the Java Integrated Industrial  and Port Estate (JIIPE) located in Gresik in East Java as one of  Company’s expansion strategies.
Through JIIPE, the Company is  providing logistics and energy solutions to industrial customers.
The project will be one of the largest integrated industrial and port  estates in Indonesia.
JIIPE will make a better contribution to the  Company in the future.
Income from the land sales and leases also  supporting infrastructure will become a new revenue source for  the Company.
