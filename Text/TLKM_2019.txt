In the European region, several factors that influence the uncertainty are the unfinished Brexit process and concerns about the increasing debt crisis of countries in the region.
Furthermore, the trade war between the United States and China also continues until the end of 2019.
Although most of the trade war policies are aimed at attacking each other between the two countries, the impact has affected not only the supply chains of both parties but also the countries other Asian countries.
Besides, the emergence of the initial case of the COVID-19 virus at the end of December 2019 in China also had an impact on the world economic situation.
Financial market uncertainty increased after the WHO statement about COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
Investors tend to attract the placement of funds in financial markets in developing countries and divert to financial assets and commodities that are considered safe such as US T-Bonds and gold.
This condition then put pressure on the world financial markets and put depreciating pressure on many global currencies, including Indonesia.
The economic challenges faced during 2019 are the continuing China-United States trade war.
This has an impact on the  economic slowdown in several countries including Indonesia, especially export performance.
Indonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019 grew quite well reaching 5.02%.
The biggest contribution from  economic growth, which is around 56%, still comes from household consumption.
This indicates that people’s purchasing power is relatively good, which is partly due to the massive development of infrastructure in the last few years.
Inflation was moderately controlled at 2.72% and was able to maintain people’s purchasing power.
In terms of key macro indicators, the exchange rate of the Rupiah against the USD in 2019 was relatively stable and even tended to strengthen, with the Bank Indonesia transaction rate of Rp14,465 per USD on January 2, 2019, and on December 31, 2019 closing at an exchange rate of Rp13,901.
Likewise, Bank Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate (BI 7-day Repo Rate), which tends to decline from 6% in January 2019 and is at the level of 5% in December 2019.
When compared to the previous year, economic growth slowed.
However, in general, the condition of the Indonesian  economy is quite strong and this is still considered positive by the world economic rating agencies.
The international rating agency Standard & Poor gave a BBB rating (Stable) on May 31, 2019, and the Fitch Rating set BBB/F2 for rating Indonesia on March 14, 2019.
With this rating, Indonesia is still considered to have a stable economy and is worthy of being an investment objective (investment grade).
From a political standpoint, the Election activities held in April 2019 were successfully held smoothly, safely, and  peacefully.
This also gives confidence to business people to realize their business plans, which may have been delayed due to political uncertainty in the previous year.
INDONESIA’S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY The growth of the telecommunications industry in Indonesia in recent years has been driven mainly by growth in fixed and mobile broadband customers.
The main driver of the growth of the telecommunications industry in Indonesia is an increase in data usage due to more affordable prices, improved services, and smartphone penetration.
The shift from legacy services (such as voice and SMS) to data services continues, supported by the availability of cheaper smartphones and the development of the youth segment.
Data services continue to grow, but SMS and voice services have decreased significantly.
Over The Top applications have become a part of Indonesian people’s lives, including voice and video calls, supported by the advantages of these applications compared to conventional services, such as easier usage and variety and quality of service continues to increase.
But on the other hand, the increase in digital economic activity in Indonesian society also caused major changes in the activities of all aspects of the economy.
The telecommunications industry, particularly the mobile segment, is still at the intense competition in recent years.
Intensive promotions by operators, such as giving bonus data to attract new customers, are still being carried out even though the intensity has decreased compared to the previous year.
Customers are still quite sensitive to data prices, and low margins are still pressured on telecommunications operators.
Throughout 2019, the cellular industry which refers to the 3 largest cellular operators, grew in the range of 5.1%.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW 2019 Theme Highlight TelkomReport of The Board of Commissioners  and DirectorsAbout Telkom Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social ResponsibilityPartnership and Community Development Program (PKBL)Appendices Consolidated Financial Statements101 Annual Report 2019 PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Based on internal calculations and publicly available data, SIM card penetration in the cellular industry in Indonesia is more  than 100% so that the growth space is limited.
The number of customers, based on data disclosed by market players and company internal data, the three largest cellular operators in Indonesia are Telkomsel, Indosat, and XL Axiata.
They accounted for more than 80% market share as of December 31, 2019, and Telkomsel remained the largest cellular provider in Indonesia, with around 171.1 million customers, growing 5.0% with a market share among the three operators around 59.6%.
Data consumption in the mobile segment continues to increase, and it is expected that the level of consumption per user  will continue to increase each year.
This growth in data consumption requires significant capital expenditure support to provide increased capacity and coverage needed to accommodate this growth.
Data is the main revenue driver for telecommunications companies, in the form of traffic volume mainly driven by HD/Ultra HD video streaming, video on demand, games, and an increase in the number of other devices connected to the network.
To support the increase in data traffic, the company continues to invest in additional BTS, core networks, and towers, both in the form of macro or micro towers.
The growth of data traffic is supported by 4G technology and cellular operators are working to increase the capacity and reach of this service.
Telecommunications companies have 3G/4G coverage which covers all of Java and adjacent islands.
Operators usually start with a certain scope then invest in the capacity to meet demand due to customer adoption and increased usage.
Lower margins for telecommunications companies due to shifting focus to the data business from legacy services require telecommunications operators to make cost savings.
Meanwhile, the fixed broadband industry grew by around 22% in 2019, which refers to the 2 main fixed broadband players  with an estimated market share of 93%.
Demand for fixed broadband services in Indonesia will increase in 2019, both in large, medium, and small cities.
This is marked by an increase in the number of fixed broadband subscribers, although for Indonesia there is a geographical challenge to connect populations spread across the archipelago.
Indonesian users increasingly expect high-quality internet connectivity to their homes, thus encouraging fixed broadband operators to invest in the development of fiber optic networks.
At present, the national fixed broadband market is still dominated by several of these service providers.
The service penetration is also still very low at around less than 15% at the end of 2019.
Considering that building a fiber-optic network requires a large amount of money and a relatively long time, the obstacles to enter the fixed broadband market are still high.
As of December 31, 2019, Telkom had 7 million IndiHome fixed broadband customers and around 2 million fixed broadband non IndiHome customers.
To attract new customers, operators offer pay-TV bundles and TV on-demand, as well as packages with other value-added services.
COMPETITION IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY Telkom has a variety of products and services including cellular services, fixed broadband, and fixed voice, enterprise, interconnection to satellite services with the general picture of competition as follows.
Mobile BusinessAs of December 31, 2019, Telkomsel remained the largest cellular provider in Indonesia, with approximately 171.1 million  cellular subscribers and a market share of approximately 59.6% based on our internal estimate of the number of total subscribers.
We believe the next largest providers were Indosat and XL Axiata, based on the number of subscribers as of December 31, 2019.
Several other smaller operators also provide cellular services in Indonesia, including Hutchison, which is part of the Hutchison Asia Telecom Group and operates under the “3” or “Tri” brand, and Smartfren Telecom, which is part of the Sinar Mas Group.
The penetration of SIM cards in the cellular industry in Indonesia is quite high, at well over 100%, making continued growth  in penetration increasingly limited.
There were approximately 341 million cellular subscribers in Indonesia as of December 31, 2019, an increase 6.6% from approximately 320 million as of December 31, 2018.
The shifting trend from legacy services (such as voice and SMS) to data services continues to develop, driven by cheaper prices of smartphones as well as the rapidly growing youth customer segment.
Data traffic has grown significantly, while service traffic has decreased.
Minutes of usage per mobile subscriber also started to decrease in the second half of 2017.
These trends continued in 2019 and are likely to continue in the foreseeable future, as they are attributable to the substitution of traditional voice and SMS services to Over the Top based calling and messaging services as smartphone penetration in   Indonesia has risen.
Theme Highlight TelkomReport of The Board of Commissioners  and DirectorsAbout Telkom Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social ResponsibilityPartnership and Community Development Program (PKBL)Appendices Consolidated Financial Statements PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2019102 Fixed Voice & Broadband Business (Fixed Business) In the fixed broadband industry, Telkom is faced with major competitors including the First Media, BizNet Home, MNC  Play, and MyRepublic brands.
Among some of Telkom’s competitors, First Media has the largest number of customers.
In recent years, Telkom has also faced competition from MNC Play and My Republic which focus on established household market targets in the Greater Jakarta area.
BizNet is quite competitive in the corporate and business segments, especially in Java and Bali.
However, Telkom is still superior in terms of coverage and infrastructure that has spread to all parts of Indonesia.
In the last two years Telkom has also sought to migrate DSL technology to fiber-based broadband to provide better service quality and expand digital services.
Competition is getting tougher into 2019 with the emergence of newcomers, including a subsidiary of the state-owned electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) under the ICON + brand and Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) with the Gasnet brand which began offering commercial Internet and TV services.
Supported by the distribution network that is owned by its parent company, these competitors have the potential to benefit outside of Java.
At the end of the year, market changes continue with an announcement from MNC Vision to acquire Link Net.
In addition, XL Axiata and Indosat also started to enter home services by launching product namely XL Home and Indosat GIG.
Data CenterWe are committed to providing the highest level of data center solutions to our customers in Indonesia and the  region.
Supported by our proprietary self-owned submarine cable network, our comprehensive colocation services are designed to be flexible, modular, seamless and scalable to meet our customers’ business needs.
Some other companies, including DCI Indonesia, Indosat Ooredoo, Moratelindo, IDC Indonesia, NTT Communication, Global Axcess System, Biznet, Centrin Online, Cyber TechTonic Pratama, and JupiterDC also provide data center in Indonesia.
In the region, our subsidiary, Telin, competes with other major data center providers such as Equinix, Global Switch, SGX, and Epsilon in Singapore.
In Hong Kong, Telin competes with other major data center providers such as SUNeVision, Equinix, OneAsia Network, HKCOLO, and HK Exchange and Clearing.
International Traffic and Interconnection BusinessThe current operators of traditional international traffic IDD (non-VoIP) in Indonesia are only Telkom and Indosat.
But the rivalry in this business line is the presence of OTT or digital communication services such as Skype, Line, and WhatsApp, or other VoIP service providers that open international access.
Its contribution to Telkom revenue lessened significantly by the presence of OTT.
To overcome this competition, Telkom preferred to provide the OTT service platform than confront it directly.
Telkom  emphasized revenue and profit of broadband use through a digital hub and Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Network and Satellite Infrastructure BusinessIn infrastructure business especially tower, Telkom competes with other companies such as Tower Bersama Infrastructure,  PT Profesional Telekomunikasi Indonesia, and Solusi Tunas Pratama, as well as other telecommunication operators such as Indosat and XL Axiata.
Its operating activities were managed by Telkom subsidiary Mitratel and Telkomsel.
Its strategy was building a new tower or co-location by leasing the existing tower to cellular operators.
Telkom also delivers traffic carrier service as the operator that has a backbone network.
In 2019, tenancy demand was more stable as a result of the expansion of mobile broadband.
The Asia Pacific region, and especially Southeast Asia, continues to need satellites for both telecommunications and  broadcasting infrastructure, due to the characteristics of the region as an archipelago.
The capabilities provided by satellites include cellular backhaul, broadband backhaul, enterprise network, occasional usage TV, military and government network, video distribution, DTH television, flight communication, and disaster recovery.
In satellite business management, Telkom competed with many other satellite operators with satellites covering  Southeast Asia and South Asia, and several operators are in the process of developing satellites with coverage over these regions.
The Telkom-3S satellite became operational in April 2017 and the Merah Putih Satellite became operational in September 2018.
The Telkom-3S satellite, operates at orbital slot 118 E, the Telkom-2 Satellite operates at orbital slot 157 E and the Merah Putih Satellite operates at orbital slot 108 E.

It is the largest contributor to  TelkomGroup’s consolidated revenue, which contribute 65.1%.
The performance of Mobile segment for the past three years can be seen as follows: Mobile Segment2019-2018 2019 2018 2017 (%) (Rp billion) (US$ million) (Rp Billion ) (Rp Billion ) Revenues 3.0  87,897 6,331  85,338  90,073 Expenses 2.4 (41,019) (2,955)  (40,041)  (39,452) Result 3.5  46,878 3,376  45,297  50,621 Throughout 2019, the Mobile segment recorded revenues of Rp87,897 billion (US$6,331 million).
This achievement increased by Rp2,559 billion, or 3.0% of revenue from the previous year.
The increase in revenue of  Mobile segment in 2019 was mainly due to an increase in mobile data traffic by 54,0%, which encouraged positive growth of cellular internet and data revenue in 2019.
The increase in data traffic was driven by effective marketing programs by offering various attractive data packages at competitive prices.
On the other hand, there was decrease in voice and SMS revenue.

This program aims to explore the potential revenue from assets that are not optimal, increasing efficiency, and reducing asset maintenance costs.
In cooperation, Telkom provides service solutions in providing data connectivity or internet access, call centers, security, and other products as additional facilities to indirectly increase the value of assets and help diversify the ecosystem digital Telkom Utilization of assets within the TelkomGroup is mostly carried out by Telkom’s subsidiary, PT Graha Sarana Duta (Telkom Property).

Therefore, Telkom and its subsidiaries always support technological developments and respond to market developments by supporting new technologies.
In practice, TelkomGroup continues to adapt and create new products, services, standards, and business models created with technological change.
Furthermore, Telkom and its subsidiaries make large investments to develop additional products and services, so they can provide different values     compared to c ompetitors’ products and services.
Mobile Segment Market Share Telkom’s subsidiary, Telkomsel, had 171.1 million cellular subscribers in 2019, including 110.3 million mobile broadband customers.
The number is increase from 163.0 million cellular subscribers in 2018.
Based on the number of subscribers, We estimate Telkomsel’s market share in 2019 for the cellular segment reached a 59.6% increase from 59.1% compared with previous year.
Indosat and XL Axiata are Telkomsel’s main segments in the Mobile segment.
In addition to these operators, in 2019  Telkomsel saw an increase in competition in Indonesia from other cellular operators.
Some of them are PT Hutchison 3 Indonesia (“Hutchison”) which is part of the Hutchison Asia Telecom Group and is operated under the “3” or “Tri” brand, as well as the Sinar Mas Group business group, namely PT Smartfren Telecom Tbk.

Cellular operators have the potential to do so to reduce operating costs and increase broader spectrum allocation.
Thus, cellular operators have greater resources and opportunities to increase business excellence.
From the Government side, the Ministry of Communication and Information (MoCl) supports the merger, acquisition and consolidation efforts by not issuing new or additional licenses for cellular operators.
One example that occurred was the acquisition of XL Axiata to PT Axis Telekom’s majority shares that had been  conducted since 2014.
After the acquisition, XL Axiata obtained an additional frequency allocation to provide 4G / LTE services.
XL Axiata also enlarged its customer base by taking over PT Axis Telekom’s customers.
MARKETING OVERVIEW Theme Highlight TelkomReport of The Board of Commissioners  and DirectorsAbout Telkom Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social ResponsibilityPartnership and Community Development Program (PKBL)Appendices Consolidated Financial Statements PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2019120 In addition to technology, the market share of the Mobile segment is also influenced by various other factors, such as  price competition, competition with OTT that provides voice and text services, and the ability to expand networks.
In contrast to previous years, the intensity of price competition in 2019 was slightly reduced.
However, price pressures may continue in the future along with the increasing competition between cellular operators and OTT supported by the penetration of smartphone usage in Indonesia.
In the face of competition in 2019, several competitors are also working to increase service coverage by expanding outside Java.
Of all the challenges that must be faced, the biggest challenge of Telkom and its subsidiaries in the Mobile segment is  competition against OTT.
Telkomsel is facing a rapid increase in customer acquisition by OTT, which is supported by the rise of new technologies that are more effective and efficient in providing voice and text services.
This risks losing market share and can harm Telkomsel’s business, finance and operations.
Consumer Segment Market Share In the Consumer segment, TelkomGroup has IndiHome’s main products and services that compete with other fixed broadband service providers such as First Media, BizNet Home, MNC Play and MyRepublic.
Among competitors, First Media has the largest number of customers.
In terms of customer segmentation, MNC Play and MyRepublic become competitors that target middle and upper-class household customers in Greater Jakarta, while BizNet is very competitive in the corporate market, especially in Java and Bali.
In addition, XL Axiata and Indosat also started to enter home services by launching product namely XL Home and Indosat GIG.
Throughout 2019, IndiHome’s marketing and sales will continue to focus on potential customers in various segments  throughout Indonesia.
Despite facing competitive competition, by the end of 2019, TelkomGroup had won an additional 1.9 million new customers, leaving the total number of IndiHome subscribers to be 7.0 million subscribers.
With this achievement, the fixed broadband market share is equal to 86.5% based on our internal calculations.
This position is more than the previous year with a market share of 84.5%.
This success in increasing market share is supported by an increase in the reach of access infrastructure, appropriate marketing strategies and the use of information technology that can improve service quality and customer satisfaction.

In recent years, through IndiHome products, TelkomGroup has sought migration of customers from home legacy products and services to IndiHome which combines fixed voice with fixed broadband, IP-TV and digital in one product and service.
However, TelkomGroup still faces great challenges from the massive growth of OTT.

Mitratel’s market share in 2019 increased 4.1%, from 19.8% in 2018 to 23.9% in 2019 based on internal calculations.

At present, TelkomGroup has the largest network infrastructure capacity in Indonesia.
The existence of these regulations will reduce the competitiveness of TelkomGroup because competitors can use the infrastructure network of Telkom and its subsidiaries with more affordable capital and expenses.
Digital and Other Segments Market Share Competition in the digital segment is very broad and can cover various business sectors, such as transportation, retail, and finance.
TelkomGroup has an e-commerce platform BLANJA.

Throughout 2019, TelkomGroup can maintain the flow of funds to manage short-term and long-term debt as expected.
To maintain liquidity, Telkom utilizes cash flow from various sources, including the availability of internal funds, operating profit for the year, debt instruments, bank loan facilities, or other sources that are legal by   Indonesian law.
SHORT-TERM DEBT The ability of TelkomGroup to pay short-term debt can be seen from the current ratio, quick ratio and cash ratio in 2019.
These ratios are always closely monitored to ensure liquidity and availability of funds for payment of maturities short-term debt can be fulfilled.
On the other hand, Telkom and its subsidiaries also need to maintain optimal liquidity and can be used productively.
In the 2019 performance period, Telkom’s strategy to maintain the ability to pay short-term debt, among others, is to  maintain the current ratio above the industry average current ratio and maintain the availability of loan facilities that can be withdrawn if needed.
The short-term liquidity ratio of Telkom and its subsidiaries is shown in the following table: Ratio 2019 2018 2017 Current Ratio 71.5%  93.5%  104.8% Quick Ratio 52.9%  66.8%  81.3% Cash Ratio 32.2%  40.5%  60.2% LONG-TERM DEBT In measuring the ability to pay long-term debt, Telkom and its subsidiaries monitor the debt to equity ratio, debt to  EBITDA ratio and EBITDA to interest expense ratio.
Telkom and its subsidiaries’ consolidated financial statements as of the end of 2019 show a debt to equity ratio of 0.44 times, debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.80 times and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 15.3 times.
The performance of these ratios shows the ability to pay long-term debt is good with a relatively low risk of default.
Currently, financial condition indicators are quite strong and to maintain the company’s financial stability and improve  the effectiveness of financing and working capital management, Telkom need to carry out a debt reprofiling strategy, which is to improve the debt profile by shifting a portion of floating interest debt to fixed interest.
The main objective of this debt reprofiling effort is to reduce interest expense and exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the future.
Some of the strategies that have been carried out are as follows: •  Optimizing the use of internal funding sources t o fulfill the corporate funding requirement.
• Balance the proportion of inter est rates between floating rates and fixed rates.

In line with that, throughout 2019, TelkomGroup has continued to optimize the cost of capital (weighted average cost of capital), tax benefits, and also maintain the balance of capital structure by using financial ratios as a monitoring mechanism.
TelkomGroup can renew the funding scheme if it is considered more efficient and profitable.

In the future, TelkomGroup  can use internal and external funding sources, such as bank funding, debt instruments or additional share capital for investment in capital expenditure by its business planning.
DENOMINATED CURRENCIES OF MATERIAL COMMITMENT FOR CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE By its investment characteristics, Telkom uses several currency denominations in material commitment for investment  in capital expenditure, namely Rupiah and foreign currency such as US Dollar, Euro, and HKD.
The largest material commitment is in the Rupiah currency of Rp9,412 billion.
As of December 31, 2019, the composition of material commitments for capital expenditure in Rupiah and foreign  currencies can be seen as follows: Table of Material Commitment based on  CurrenciesAmounts in Foreign  CurrenciesEquivalent in Rupiah (in million) (in billion) Rupiah 9,412 US Dollar 87.78 1,219 Euro 1.06 16 HKD 0.77 1 Total 10,648 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MITIGATION OF MATERIAL CONTRACTS FOR  CAPITAL EXPENDITURE The use of foreign currencies, especially in the material commitment of capital expenditure, has risks and opportunities  from the volatility of the exchange rate.
For this reason, Telkom determines that time deposits and receivables in foreign currencies at least 25% of short-term liabilities in foreign currencies owed.
With this policy, Telkom could offsetting between gains on time deposits and receivables with exchange rate losses from material commitments for capital expenditure to minimize exchange rate risk.
A description of the material commitments for investment in capital expenditure and foreign exchange risk can be  seen in Notes 33 Significant Commitment and Agreements and Notes 35 Financial Risk Management in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements.

RECEIVABLES COLLECTABILITY Theme Highlight TelkomReport of The Board of Commissioners  and DirectorsAbout Telkom Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social ResponsibilityPartnership and Community Development Program (PKBL)Appendices Consolidated Financial Statements151 Annual Report 2019 PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk To meet the principles of transparency and accountability in carrying out good corporate governance, Telkom discloses  information and material facts that occurred after the date of the accountant’s report as of December 31, 2019, as follows:MATERIAL INFORMATION AND FACT AFTER  ACCOUNTANT REPORTING DATE No Material Information and Facts 1 The Company will buy back its shares from public, with a maximum amount Rp1,500 billion, and will be  carried out in stages since March 30, 2020 until June 29, 2020. 2 On January 11, 2020, Telkomsel paid its bank loan to Mandiri amounting to Rp3,000 billion. 3 On May 11, 2020, TII paid its bank loan to MUFG Bank amounting to US$6.7 million or equal to Rp101 billion. 4 In January 2020, the Company received tax refunds for VAT for fiscal periods February and August 2011 and  January to December 2017 amounting to Rp29.6 billion and Rp747 billion, respectively. 5 On March 31, 2020, the Government issued Government Regulation in Lieu of the Republic of Indonesia Number 1 Year 2020 which stipulates, among others, reduction to the tax rates for corporate income tax payer and permanent establishments entities from previously 25% to become 22% for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and 20% starting fiscal year 2022 and onwards, and further reduction of 3% for corporate income tax payers that fulfill certain criteria.
The new tax rates will be used as reference to measure the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities starting from fiscal year 2020. 6 Since the beginning of 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on business activities and economic growth in Indonesia, due to restrictions on social activities.
In this case, the Government has taken a number of policies to respond and anticipate the effects of this pandemic.
Group has determined that this event is a non-adjusted event after the reporting period, so that these consolidated financial statements are not adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic impact because the Government’s handling process is still ongoing and cannot be determined for a period of time, so specific impacts such as on business, the revenue and recoverable value of the Group’s assets and liabilities cannot be determined reliably.
The Company’s operations have and may continue to be impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 virus which started in China and subsequently spread to other countries including Indonesia.
The effect of COVID-19 virus to the global and Indonesian economy include effect to economic growth, decline in capital markets, increase in credit risk, depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates and disruption of business operation.
The future effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 virus to Indonesia and the Company are unclear at this time.
A significant rise in the number of COVID-19 virus infections or prolongation of the outbreak may affect Indonesia and the Company.
The Company is presently evaluating and has not yet determined the effects of COVID-19 virus on its financial statements.
As of the completion date of these financial statements, there has been decline in Rupiah foreign currency exchange rates which partially due to impact of COVID-19 virus.
To address the above conditions, management has conducted and plans to do the following:i.
Adjust some programs and initiatives in order to deliver services to customers by accelerating sales digitalization to ensure product and service availability.
Maintaining the Company’s cash flow to be positive and mitigate foreign exchange fluctuation.
Intensify cost leadership by prioritizing programs and initiatives.
Ensure IT system and networks readiness to deliver optimal customers experiences.
The explanation can be found in the 2019 Telkom Consolidated Financial Statements, particularly in notes   38 Subsequent Event.

In 2019, the assessment was carried out using a risk management approach and refers to the COSO Framework method that was published in 2014.
The results of the assessment indicate things that can affect the sustainability of Telkom’s business, both from internal and external aspects, namely:1.
The dynamics of the macro-envir onment that has  the potential to change in a negative direction and less favorable for the digital and telecommunications industry sectors, such as poor liquidity, the uncertainty of monetary policy, and trade war. 2.
Declining reputation, especially if financial and corpor ate governance performance is not going well. 3.
High pressure fr om Over The Top (OTT) drive the  decrease in legacy income faster than expected. 4.
The risk of uncertainty in digital business due t o  changes in the digital age is very fast. 5.
Risk of uncertainty in business dev elopment  through in-organic initiatives, namely through the alliance & acquisition strategy, which requires   large investments.   6.
Efforts to monetize or ganic investment to cover  the decline in income due to OTT pressure have not   met expectations.     7.
Potential f ailure of infrastructure operations due  to various things, both by natural disasters and   human activities.     8.
Increasing cyber thr eats to Telkom’s infrastructure,  applications or services.     9.
There are r evenue leaks and fraud caused by SIMBOX  Fraud, Toll Fraud and A2P SMS.     10.
Challenges in developing digital capability and Entrop y  in organizations, especially related to the performance of human resources.     11.
Changes in domestic telecommunica tions regulations  that can cause increased expenses, lower revenue, and limit Telkom’s operations.      12.
Although it has not significantly disrupted the sustainability of Telk om’s business, the existence  of important cases faced by Telkom needs to be continuously monitored and managed properly to avoid negative impacts in the future.  13.
Increased risks to Internal C ontrol (ICOFR) need to  be cautious in line with the development of business operations in the future.     14.
Very dynamic financial risks relat ed to liquidity risk,  fluctuating foreign exchange risk, credit risk and interest rate risk need to be managed by Telkom to prevent a negative impact on Telkom, such as the decline in the value of assets and the increase in liabilities.
In connection with the continuity of Telk om’s business  throughout 2019, several important events that have become a concern and can increase or decrease the risk of Telkom’s sustainability include:1.
Geopolitical turmoil that is still heating up due t o  trade wars between the United States and China.
Tariff war, sanctions, regulatory changes in technology protection, supply chain uncertainty, and the threat of data leakage due to global competition became a serious threat to Telkom    2.
Domestically, Indonesia has carried out the 2019 elections w ell.
Although the Election Vulnerability Index  in Indonesia is quite good, investors take a cautious stance if there is political and economic instability   3.
Telkom still f aces important cases from the previous  year, among others related to the lawsuit of PT Citra Sari Makmur related to the termination of cooperation in the utilization of the Fixed Network and Supporting Facilities (Transponders) and heirs of H.
Ali related to the land on which the location of STO Telkom Pettarani.
In this case, Telkom continues to make the best legal efforts to oversee the proceedings of the lawsuit.    4.
In terms of regulations, se veral things that concern  Telkom, namely:     • Revision of Gov ernment Regulation No.52 and 53  of 2000 related to network (backbone) sharing and frequency sharing will be counter productive   to Telkom.
• The implementation of Minist er of Communication  and Informatics (MoCI) Regulation No. 13 of 2019 which changes the Minister of Transportation Decree No. 21 of 2001 concerning the Delivery of Telecommunications Services has the potential to change the dynamics of the telecommunications and information industry.
• The implementation of Law No .28 of 2009 regarding  Regional Taxes and Levies, specifically related to the levies of controlling telecommunications towers at a maximum of 2% of the tax object sale   value (NJOP).

• implementation of Goverment R egulation Number  71 Year 2019 regarding the Implementation of Electronic Transaction of and Systems (PSTE) which states that providers of public electronic systems can place data outside the territory of Indonesia.
• Several other DOC r egulations related to Over  The Top (OTT) services, telecommunications joint technical infrastructure, and tariffs for providing telecommunications services.  5.
Indonesia’s macroeconomic challenges tha t grow in  the range of 5%, but still experience a budget deficit.
Although Indonesia has the largest economic posture in Southeast Asia, this needs to be watched out because it can hurt national economic stability, especially in the long term.
In connection with the foregoing, the impact on T elkom  is the increase in Telkom’s risk profile in 2019 which includes strategic, operational and compliance risks.
Also, from the financial side, Telkom has a risk of increasing   uncollectible receivables.
Furthermore, in  analyzing the company’s business  sustainability, Telkom uses several assumptions on strategic decisions making in 2019, namely:1.

Data connectivity and digital services are now the basic needs of the community, and even their use has penetrated in small towns and rural areas.
As for institutions and business people, digital services have become the main need to improve services and to maintain and develop their businesses.
Telkom, with all of its infrastructure and facilities, is at the forefront to take these opportunities and continue to grow   in the future.
For the Mobile segment, there is business potential in three  focus areas, namely increasing potential growth in high-value customers, mobile solution services for the enterprise segment, and developing various digital services such as mobile financial services, games, and video.
Currently, high-value customers make a significant contribution to Telkomsel’s revenue.
To provide the best experience to maintain loyalty while increasing the number of high-value customers, we do profiling of high-value customers and utilize big data analytics so that they can offer diverse and quality services according to their personal needs.
We also develop products to meet the needs and demands of the youth segment through by.
U products to fulfill their lifestyle because young people will still dominate in Indonesia demographic structure for few next years.
Telkom also continues to develop innovative products and digital solutions for the enterprise segment or B2B including mobile security, NB-IoT and other cellular solutions that utilize the Telkomel myBusiness product portfolio.
Meanwhile, on digital services, we focus on providing lifestyle experiences such as video, games, and music.
Along with the increasing use of smartphones, by the end of  2019 169.5 million of our customers have used smartphones (up 4.6% from last year), and it is expected to continue to grow.
The wider use of smartphones will also encourage the growth of digital services & solutions where Telkomsel has prepared platforms, applications and content to anticipate the needs of these customers.
Globally the cellular business is experiencing pressure on yield data (data prices per gigabytes), which in Indonesia is quite low compared to global benchmarks.
This happens because the level of competition is still competitive.
In the enterprise segment, opportunities to increase business  growth are still wide open.
We always strive to find new sources of growth that are sustainable (recurring).
One of the business lines that we will develop is the data center.
We believe that the data center business has high potential demand along with the development of digital services such as e-commerce and various other digital solutions and provides a fairly good level of profitability.
We also believe that the trend of digitizing business processes in corporations will continue to strengthen, as will government agencies and institutions, both central and regional.
Also, the penetration of ICT services among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is still relatively low.
We hope that our presence by providing ICT services can help business development among SMEs given the enormous benefits generated, and at the same time is a market opportunity for us to be able to grow together.
We also actively explore opportunities for enhancing digital capabilities through inorganic activities to strengthen integrated digital services.
In the Consumer segment, opportunities to continue to grow  are still wide open.
Besides, the level of competition is also relatively low since fixed broadband service providers require relatively high capital expenditure requirements, which is one of the barriers to entry for newcomers or for existing operators to expand to various regions.
In terms of products and services, Telkom always provides additional choices for customers by offering more varied services and products so that they can reach a wider market niche according to customer needs.
Among of them, we develop Indihome Lite products that offer affordable prices to reach a wider market segment.
For the wholesale and International Business segment, by  connecting the SEA-ME-WE 5 connectivity line with the SEA-US through the Indonesia Global Gateway (IGG) which is a submarine cable communication system owned by Telkom, this makes Telkom stronger in playing a role as a possible Hub Telkom provides alternative direct broadband connections between Europe, Asia, and America.
We continue to develop the data center business.
After 2019, TelkomGroup increases the capacity of neuCentrIX data centers in Indonesia to accommodate customer demand, we also build a new neuCentrIX data center in Jakarta which is expected to be completed in 2021.
Besides, we also strengthen the tower supply business.
In 2019, Telkom through Mitratel acquired 95.0% of share capital in PT Persada Sokka Tama, which has 1,017 towers located throughout Indonesia.
Then, in October 2019, Mitratel signed an agreement to buy 2,100 telecommunication towers from PT Indosat Tbk.
The development of towers either organically or through acquisitions will strengthen the tower business line and open up even greater opportunities, moreover, it is predicted that in the next few years new cellular technology, 5G, will need higher tower densities.

The model has been criticized for not being able to meet the needs of users of financial statements because it does not always provide an appropriate representation of rental transactions.
Specifically, the model does not require lessee to recognize assets and liabilities arising from operating leases.
N/A IFRS 16 introduces the single lessee accounting model and requires tenants to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with a period of more than 12 months, except for low-value underlying assets.
The lessee recognizes the right of use asset that represent his right to use the leased assets and lease liabilities that represent his obligation to make the lease payment.
The lessee will also separately recognize interest expense on lease liability and recognize depreciation expense on the leased assets.
