In 2023, the global macroeconomic condition exhibited a mix of recovery and challenges.
Many countries continued to grapple with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, striving to balance reopening efforts with ongoing concerns about public health and economic stability.
While some regions experienced robust economic growth driven by stimulus measures and vaccine distribution, others faced setbacks due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions.
Indonesia's macroeconomic condition in 2023 reflected  these global trends while contending with domestic factors.
The country navigated a delicate balance between stimulating economic recovery and managing inflationary pressures.
However, a mix of challenges continued to persist as GDP growth momentum softened to 5.05% in 2023.
In 2024, we maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook,  considering the ongoing escalation of geopolitical tensions and the high-interest rate environment in the US, both of which contribute to persistent inflationary pressures.
These factors pose potential risks of foreign capital outflow and depreciation of the Indonesian Rupiah currency domestically.
Having said that, it's worth noting that monetary policy measures may not transition to an expansionary cycle as quickly as anticipated.
On a brighter note, we anticipate a potential boost in  consumer spending due to the upcoming election, coupled with favorable fiscal measures likely to mitigate inflationary pressures stemming from the El Nino impact and rising oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
Additionally, although commodity prices have declined from their peak levels, their sustained elevation should continue to provide some degree of support to the overall economy. 97 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate Governance Tanggung Jawab Sosial Lingkungan Corporate Social ResponsibilityA Journey of Continuous TransformationAnalisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & AnalysisTinjauan Industri Industry Overview Sektor petrokimia global pada tahun 2023 terdampak  secara signifikan oleh melemahnya harga jual produk, terutama akibat kemunduran perekonomian Tiongkok.
The adverse impact was significant as China accounts for a large global petrochemical market share.
This resulted in lower utilization and decreased margins for petrochemical manufacturers worldwide.
Despite the considerable volatility experienced in the  petrochemical sector, the domestic consumption of plastic products has shown resilience, maintaining relatively healthy growth in alignment with overall economic expansion.
This robust growth in domestic demand can be attributed to fundamental structural factors, including low per capita plastic consumption and limited domestic capacity.
These conditions create significant opportunities for sustained growth over the coming years, with ample room for expansion.
Indonesia’s renewable energy outlook is promising,  driven by government commitments, abundant natural resources, and increasing awareness of the importance of transitioning to clean energy.
Indonesia can achieve its energy goals by harnessing its renewable energy potential while contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.
The integration of additional renewable energy capacity, as outlined in the latest National Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL), is projected to constitute approximately 50% of the new power plant installations, with an anticipated acceleration in deployment expected between 2024 and 2030.
On the potential renewable energy capacity addition,  Indonesia boasts abundant renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal.
These resources present significant opportunities for the development of clean and sustainable energy sources across the archipelago.
In the geothermal segment, Indonesia will likely maintain its leading position as a nation with the largest untapped reserves.
Geothermal provides unique position, as it is the only  renewable power with low intermittency factor, making it as the most reliable source of renewable energy.
wind segment, although wind energy currently represents a smaller share of Indonesia’s renewable energy portfolio, the government has identified coastal regions and islands with favorable wind conditions for wind farm development.
Investments in wind energy infrastructure are expected to increase in the coming years.
Despite its vast renewable energy potential, Indonesia  faces challenges such as regulatory barriers, financing constraints, and grid infrastructure limitations.
Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from the government, private sector, and international partners.
However, overcoming these obstacles presents opportunities for innovation, job creation, and sustainable economic development ahead.
The revenue contributed by each business segment for the last 2 (two) years were as follows: 99 Analisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate Governance Tanggung Jawab Sosial Lingkungan Corporate Social ResponsibilityA Journey of Continuous TransformationAnalisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & AnalysisPetrokimia Petrochemical Lini bisnis petrokimia Perseroan dikelola oleh Chandra  Asri.

Indonesia’s economic growth trajectory in 2024 is anticipated to stabilize, hovering around the 5% mark according to IMF.
However, several challenges may emerge from uncertainties surrounding global monetary policies, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing policy reforms.
In the coming years, the green energy sector stretches out  promising bright horizons in the long term.
Commitment and real-world action to carry out the energy transition opens up opportunities and potential for business actors to continue to innovate and transform for a better future.
In the energy sector, Indonesia is steadfastly increasing  its emissions reduction target to 358 million CO 2 by  2030.
This is being achieved through the development of renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon fuels, and clean coal technology.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) has identified an enormous renewable energy potential in Indonesia, amounting to 3,687 gigawatts (GW).
Of this, solar energy potential is the largest, reaching 3,294 GW.
By consolidating our energy pillar, we succeeded in bringing BREN, our subsidiary, to carry out an Initial Public Offering, which received an extraordinary response from investors.
Apart from that, diversification in our petrochemical sector into chemical and infrastructure solutions has also been done, thanks to our capable subsidiary strategy.
Geopolitical conflicts still influence weaker performance  in 2023.
Still, in terms of business portfolio, our energy segment continues to provide the necessary cushion to withstand the impact of the volatile petrochemical segment, so consolidated EBITDA is still positive at US$612 million (+28.8% YoY).
Meanwhile, we also managed to record a Consolidated Net Profit After Tax of US$100 million (+213% YoY).
We have maintained a prudent financial policy throughout  2023, as demonstrated by our strong liquidity pool and healthy leverage matrix.
The Company remains committed to implementing an  expansion strategy through group restructuring and consolidating renewable energy assets to strengthen our position in the renewable energy sector and supplement our geothermal portfolio with other renewable energy such as wind.
We also diversified our business in the petrochemical sector, which now includes the infrastructure segment.
This strategy is expected to strengthen the Company’s position as a diversified and integrated petrochemical and energy company and enable the Company to support Indonesia’s economic growth and achieve the net zero emission target.
Conversely, the petrochemical industry is poised to grow and emerge as a critical pillar supporting the economy in the years ahead.
Supported by downstream policy, the petrochemical sector’s robust investment realization performance reached Rp46.3 trillion by 2023.
Inisiatif strategis ini meningkatkan kemampuan operasional kami dan meletakkan dasar yang kokoh untuk ekspansi dan At Barito Pacific, we remain committed to conducting our business operations and expansion plans with a prudent and expedient approach.
