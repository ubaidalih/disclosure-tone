Anticipating a potential decline of asset quality, the Bank  has implemented an Early Warning System (EWS) to monitor changes in debtor repayment capacity as preventive actions to minimize the risk of default.
BCA periodically reviews business performance and ﬁnancial performance of its debtors and immediately takes the necessary actions if the debtors experience business or ﬁnancial difﬁculties.
Liquidity  BCA maintains an adequate liquidity position and monitors the balance between short-term liabilities that must be fulﬁlled, and the availability of short-term funds held by the Bank.
BCA ensures sufﬁcient funds for short-term, liquid, and low-risk placements, especially in the risk-free placement of securities issued by Bank Indonesia.
Most of BCA’s liquidity comes from current accounts and  savings accounts (CASA) with low interest rates.
In 2021, CASA grew 19.1% to Rp764.6 trillion and contributed 78.9% of total third-party funds.
High CASA ratio is one of BCA’s strengths in facing future challenges, particularly related to the potential of interest rate hikes that may occur in the future.
BCA’s Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) in December 2021 was  62.0%.
This is inseparable from the CASA growth that increased higher than loan growth amidst the low credit demand during the pandemic.
Meanwhile, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) were solid at 396.3% and 180.7%, respectively.
In order to maintain the overall position of third-party funds, BCA  proactively reviews suitable deposit rates in accordance with  liquidity conditions.
Capital Position  To support sustainable business growth at the Bank and its subsidiaries, BCA maintains an adequate capital condition.
In 2021, BCA had a consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 26.9%.
The Bank’s capital needs are fulﬁlled from organic capital growth supported by solid proﬁtability.
In accordance with POJK No.14/POJK.03/2017 regarding the  Recovery Plan for Systemic Banks, BCA issued subordinated bonds amounting to Rp500 billion in 2018 to fulﬁl obligations to issue debt securities with capital characteristics.
Exchange Rate Risk Amid ﬂuctuations in the rupiah exchange rate against foreign currencies due to global economic pressures, BCA manages risks related to foreign currency exposure by maintaining a conservative Net Open Position (NOP).
BCA’s NOP was 0.08%, far below the maximum limit of 20% imposed by the regulator.
BCA constantly monitors foreign exchange transactions,  to comply with the provisions and internal policies of the Bank, as well as Bank Indonesia Regulations (PBI) and Financial Services Authority Regulations (POJK).
Transactions processed through the branches are monitored, recorded, and reported to the Treasury Division as the coordinator who manages all foreign currency transactions.
Each branch is required to cover its foreign exchange rate risk at the end of each working day in accordance with the NOP tolerance limit given to the branch network.
Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk due to inadequacy or non-functioning internal processes, human error, system failure, and/or external events affecting Bank operations.
Operational risk is taken into account in the calculation of capital adequacy.
In managing operational risk, BCA uses the Operational  Risk Management Information System (ORMIS) application, a web-based application that includes Risk Control Self-Assessment, a Loss Event Database, and a Key Risk Indicator.
BCA continually reviews operational risk in every product, service, and new activity.
Furthermore, to instill risk culture, BCA socializes the implementation of operational risk management and regularly holds Risk Awareness programs for all units.
Related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank has taken  several actions to minimize the risks, such as:1.
Outreaching to employees with information related to  COVID-19, anticipation of its spread, and preventive actions.
In addition, a call centre was also provided for employees to seek more information related to COVID-19. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  145Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance 2.

To ensure BCA can continue to operate in the event of force  majeure, BCA has a Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) integrated with two Data Centers in different locations.
INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT As the Main Entity of a ﬁnancial conglomerate, BCA has implemented an integrated risk management framework to mitigate risk faced by BCA and its subsidiaries.
BCA has monitored and managed ten types of risk, eight of which are faced by the Bank: credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, reputation, strategic, and compliance risks, and two other risks: intra-group transaction risk and insurance risk.
In accordance with POJK No. 26/POJK.03/2015 dated 4  December 2015 on the Requirement of Integrated Minimum Capital Provision for Financial Conglomerates, BCA and its Subsidiaries have an adequate integrated minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio of 269%, above the speciﬁed minimum requirement of 100%.
BCA controls and manages ﬁnancial conglomerate risk  exposure in reference to four main pillars, summarized in the following table: 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 146 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH 4 Main Pillars of Integrated Risk Management 1.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management is also conducted through regular reports submitted to the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors.
These reports include a Risk Management Policy Implementation Report, Risk Proﬁle Report, Risk Update, and other related reports.
Implementation of Basel Accords The Bank continues to prepare for the implementation of the Basel Accords in Indonesia and participate in supporting the implementation of Basel III, both in capital and liquidity, such as through the Quantitative Impact Study (QIS).
BCA participates in the implementation of QIS on capital position, Leverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Operational Risk, as well as being involved  in the testing of Credit and Operations RWA calculation reports conducted by OJK.
OJK has implemented the NSFR ratio policy since 2017.
BCA  has complied with these rules, with regard to both reporting and the minimum ratio.
Starting March 2020, the Bank has reported and published the Leverage Ratio.
Risk Appetite The Bank deﬁnes risk appetite as the level and type of risks which the Bank is willing to take to achieve its business objectives.
The risk appetite set by BCA is reﬂected in the Bank’s business strategies and objectives.
Stress Test BCA continually and regularly performs stress testing under   a variety of scenarios and consistently deepens the factors and parameters of these tests.
Stress test scenarios consider macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, inﬂation rates, gross domestic product (GDP), exchange rates, fuel prices and others.
The methodology used in conducting stress tests, in addition to statistical models based on historical data, also employs judgment methods that consider qualitative risk factors.
Stress testing is carried out to see the impact of changes in macroeconomic factors on various key indicators, including the NPL, proﬁtability, liquidity, and capital.
The results of the Bank’s stress testing for credit, market, and  liquidity risks have been satisfactory, while the capital and liquidity of the Bank are sufﬁcient to anticipate estimated potential losses based on the built-in scenarios.
Additional to these Bank-only stress tests, BCA has conducted an integrated stress test that includes its subsidiaries.
BCA Capital Capital Structure  BCA’s capital structure consists of the following: 1.
Core capital (Tier 1) reaching 96.3% of total capital or Rp196.1 trillion, an increase of 9.0% from the previous year. 2.
Meanwhile, 3.7% of total BCA capital or Rp7.5 trillion is supplementary capital (Tier 2).
Supplementary capital is mainly  general reserve of Allowance for Asset Quality Assessment (PPKA).
Capital Component (consolidated - in billion Rupiah)  2021   2020   2019 Capital  203,621  186,953  177,888  Tier 1 Capital  196,114  179,945  170,750  Tier 2 Capital  7,507  7,008  7,138  Risk Weighted Assets (Credit, Operational and Market Risk)758,289 695,144  721,917  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) - consolidated 26.9% 26.9% 24.6% Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) - non consolidated 25.7% 25.8% 23.8% 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  151Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance Management Policy on Capital Structure BCA ensures an adequate capital position to support the  business development of the Bank and its subsidiaries.
The Bank’s capital adequacy is calculated using the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) indicator.
BCA has an adequate capital level with a CAR of 25.7%, above the minimum requirement according to the risk proﬁle plus an additional 5.0% as a buffer.
BCA has formed this buffer in accordance with the prevailing regulations regarding systemic bank compliance to fulﬁll a conservation buffer, a countercyclical buffer, and a capital surcharge.
The Bank and all its subsidiaries have carried out integrated  stress tests using various scenarios including various changes to NPL levels and their effects on income, liquidity position  and capital position.
In general, the stress tests results show  that the liquidity and capital positions of BCA and subsidiaries are adequate in anticipating losses from potential risks, based on the tested scenarios.
BCA capital requirements can be fully met from its healthy  ﬁnancial performance.
Most of the Bank’s net proﬁt is retained to increase its capital each year.
Basis for Management Policy on Capital Structure   BCA’s capital policy is regularly adjusted with reference to business potential and the application of the prudential principle.
Regarding the provisions of the Financial Services Authority, the Board of Directors prepares a capital plan as part of the Bank’s Business Plan and obtains the approval of the Board of Commissioners.
The capital structure policy refers to OJK Regulation No.11/POJK.03/2016   dated 2 February 2016 and No.34/POJK.03/2016 dated   26 September 2016 on the Minimum Capital Requirement   for Commercial Banks.
Disclosure of Risk Exposure and Implementation  of Risk Management The following is an overview of the risk exposures faced by  BCA in conducting its business and the application of risk management designed to minimize the impact of these risks.
Disclosure of Credit Risk Exposure and  Implementation of Credit Risk Management  Organization of Credit Risk Management BCA has developed a structured credit risk management process to support strong credit principles with strong internal controls: 1.
The Board of Commissioners,  responsible for  approving the Bank’s credit plans and overseeing its implementation, approving the Bank’s Credit Basic Policy, and requesting an explanation from the Board of Directors should there be any deviations in loan disbursement from the stipulated policies.  2.
The Board of Directors,  responsible for preparing the  credit plans and credit policy, ensuring the Bank’s compliance with the prevailing regulations on credit and credit policy, and reporting to the Board of Commissioners on matters such as the implementation of credit plans, irregularities in loan disbursement, loan portfolio quality, and credit in the special mention or in the non-performing loan category.    3.
Chief Risk Ofﬁcer,  is a BCA director responsible for the  management of credit, market, operational, and other risks within the Bank’s organization, which is referred as Compliance and Risk Management Director.
The role includes:  • Guiding, supervising, and ensuring the  implementation of credit policy, strategy, authority, and credit risk management   framework.
This includes setting the risk limit by taking into consideration the risk appetite and risk tolerance according to the Bank’s condition.
• Ensuring the implementation of credit risk  management is effective, amongst other through monitoring the development and the problems of Bank’s business activities related to credit risk and monitoring the credit risk of subsidiaries in the framework of integrated risk management. 4.
Work units that perform functions related to credit   risk management    The units related to credit risk management are as  follows:• Business unit performing credit disbursement  activities • Credit risk analysis unit conducting credit  worthiness analysis • Credit recovery unit handling bad debt issues.
• The Risk Management Work Unit independently  responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the credit risk, such as regularly providing input on the formulation of credit policy, developing and reviewing risk management methodology, monitoring and reporting credit risk development (including limits) and so on, to Senior Management, Compliance and Risk Management Director, and/or other Directors as necessary.
The Bank has dedicated committees assisting the Board of  Directors in the lending process: 1.
Credit Policy Committee The main function is assisting the Board of Directors  in formulating credit policies, especially those relating to the prudential principle in lending, monitoring, and evaluating the implementation of credit policies, conducting periodic reviews of the Bank’s Credit Basic Policy (KDPB), monitoring the credit portfolio’s progress and condition, and providing suggestions and corrective measures based on the results of evaluations.  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 152 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH 2.
Credit Committee  The main function is providing guidance should a more  in-depth and comprehensive credit analysis need to be performed, suggesting decisions or recommendations on the draft of credit decisions related to key debtors, speciﬁc industries or at the speciﬁc request of the Board of Directors, as well as coordinating with the Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) in terms of funding for credit and adjustment of corporate lending rates.   3.
Risk Management Committee The main function is developing policies, strategies,  and guidelines for risk management implementation, determining matters related to irregular business decisions, and enhancing the implementation of risk management based on evaluation of the effectiveness of the risk management process and system.
Risk Management Strategies for Activities with  Signiﬁcant Credit Risk Exposures   Risk management strategies are formulated in accordance with the overall business strategy and based on risk appetite and risk tolerance.
Risk management strategies are designed to ensure that BCA’s risk exposure is prudently managed in line with its credit policy, BCA’s internal procedures, laws and regulations, and other applicable provisions.
BCA has designed a structured risk management strategy  based on the following general principles:  • Risk management strategies should be long-term and  oriented for the sustainability of BCA’s business by considering economic conditions and cycles • A comprehensive risk management strategy must be  able to control and manage the risks of BCA and its subsidiaries • Maintaining expected capital adequacy and allocating  adequate resources to support the implementation of risk management.
The factors considered in designing risk management  strategies are as follows:• Economic and business development and the potential  impacts of risks faced by BCA • The organizational structure of BCA, including  the adequacy of human resources and supporting infrastructure • The ﬁnancial condition of BCA, including its ability  to generate earnings and the ability to manage risks arising from both external and internal factors • The composition and diversiﬁcation of BCA’s portfolio.
Credit Concentration Risk Management Policy  Portfolio management addresses credit concentration risk by determining limits for, amongst others, the industrial sector, foreign exchanges, and certain types of loans, as well as both individual and business group exposures.
Along with the development of a rating database, technology, human resources, the Bank’s complexity level, and the market and  regulations, the Bank’s portfolio management unit actively works to optimize the allocation of the Bank’s capital to achieve an acceptable level in line with risk appetite and risk tolerance.
Credit Risk Measurement and Control   BCA measures credit risk using a standardized method that is compliant with OJK Circular Letter No. 42/SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Guidelines for Calculating Risk Weighted Assets Using a Standardized Approach.
The regulation speciﬁes that all banks must use RWA calculation for credit risk using a Standardized Approach.
For internal needs, the Bank uses an internal rating as a  supporting tool in the credit decision-making process.
Credit  risk management is executed by establishing an independent  internal credit review for an effective credit risk management process, covering: • Evaluation of the credit administration process  • Assessment of the accuracy in the implementation of  internal risk rating and the use of other monitoring tools • Effectiveness of work units and Bank ofﬁcers responsible  for monitoring individual credit quality.
The Bank uses an early detection system to identify non- performing or potential non-performing loans to ensure it can take proactive steps in managing the loan portfolio in order to minimize the impact of non-performing loans on the overall portfolio.
Overdue and Impaired Receivables   Past due loans and receivables are deﬁned as any loan or receivable that is more than 90 days overdue for payment for either principal and/or interest.
Impaired loans and receivables are those ﬁnancial assets of signiﬁcant individual value that have objective evidence of impairment occurring after initial recognition of the ﬁnancial asset.
Individually Impaired Financial Assets    An individually impaired ﬁnancial asset is a ﬁnancial asset that is individually signiﬁcant and bears objective evidence that an individual’s impairment has occurred after the initial claim of the ﬁnancial asset.
In accordance with the Bank’s internal policy, loans  determined individually signiﬁcant are those granted to debtors in the corporate and commercial segments.
Individual measurements are made by looking at the  difference between all contractual cash ﬂows due to the entity in accordance with the contract, and all cash ﬂows that the entity expects to receive, i.
all cash shortages, discounted at the effective interest rate.  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  153Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance Financial Assets Not Individually Signiﬁcant and  Assessed Collectively for Impairment  Financial assets that are not individually signiﬁcant are those loans and receivables provided by the Group to retail segment debtors, namely Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) credit debtors, consumer ﬁnancing loans (including joint ﬁnancing loans), mortgage loans, motor vehicle credit, and credit cards.
The Group determines the impairment of ﬁnancial assets that  are not individually signiﬁcant, and where the impairment is assessed collectively, by classifying ﬁnancial assets based on similar risk characteristics.
Collective measurement is carried out statistically using the parameters of PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default).
Measurement of Expected Credit Loss  Starting 1 January 2020, the Bank’s calculation of reserves  refers to PSAK 71, which introduces the expected credit loss method for measuring losses due to impairment of ﬁnancial instruments.
If, at the reporting date, credit risk on a ﬁnancial instrument  has not increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition, the entity shall measure the allowance for losses for that ﬁnancial instrument at the amount of 12 (twelve) months expected loss.
An entity shall measure the allowance for losses on a ﬁnancial instrument at the amount of expected credit losses over its lifetime if the credit risk on that ﬁnancial instrument has increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition.
The Bank has developed risk parameter modeling, such as  PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default), which are used as components for calculating expected credit losses.
Staging Criteria   PSAK 71 requires entities to classify Financial Assets into three stages of impairment (stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3) by determining whether there is a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk.
The Bank measures the allowance for losses as 12 months  expected credit losses for ﬁnancial assets with low credit risk at the reporting date (stage 1), lifelong credit losses for ﬁnancial assets with a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk (stage 2) and ﬁnancial assets that experience a signiﬁcant decline with a history of late payment (stage 3).
At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit  risk on the ﬁnancial instrument has increased signiﬁcantly (SICR) since initial recognition.
In making that assessment, the Bank compares the risk of default with initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort that indicates a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition.
Forward Looking Information  In calculating expected credit losses, the Bank considers the macroeconomic forecast.
In addition, the Bank also determines a weighted probability for the possibility of macro scenarios.
Various macroeconomic variables (MEV) are used in modeling PSAK 71 depending on the results of statistical analysis of the suitability of the MEV with historical data for modeling impairment.
The calculation of the expected credit loss and the macroeconomic forecast (MEV) is reviewed by the Bank periodically.
Policies Related to Wrong Way Risk Exposure   To anticipate wrong way risk exposures due to market prices progressing in an adverse direction, BCA adds a capital charge for the weighted exposure of the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA risk weighted assets) in accordance with SEOJK No.42/SEOJK.03/2016.
The Impact on the Value of Provided Collateral for A  Credit Downgrade   Collateral as a credit guarantee is differentiated between  productive credit and consumer credit.
For productive loans  such as SME, Commercial and Corporate, the collateral impact (type, value and/or quality) will affect the credit rating in terms of the exposure risk factor (not the customer risk factor), so that the better the collateral can reduce the risk of exposure (the rating exposure risk factor has improved).
For consumer loans such as KPR, the impact of collateral value  will directly affect the credit rating of the debtor.
Hence, the higher collateral value, the better credit rating improvement will be.
Qualitative Disclosures regarding Securitization  Exposures (SECA)    To diversify risks and maximize returns, BCA has placed several portfolios in the form of securitization or Asset-Backed Securities Collective Investment Contracts (KIK EBA).
BCA acts as an investor and invests in EBA products with investment grade ratings and conducts placement in class (tranche) senior to receive the ﬁrst claim rights against the entire collection of ﬁnancial assets.
Standardized Approach to the Implementation of  Credit Risk Measurement In the calculation of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) for credit risk, the Bank refers to OJK Circular Letter No.42/ SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Guidelines for the Calculation of Risk Weighted Assets by using the Standardized Approach for Credit Risk, OJK Circular Letter No.48/SEOJK.03/2017 and OJK Circular Letter No.11/SEOJK.03/2018.
RWA for Credit Risk is calculated through the Basel II  standardized approach, based on ratings issued by rating agencies recognized by OJK, as stipulated in OJK Circular Letter No.37/ SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Rating Agencies and Ratings Recognized by OJK. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 154 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH The use of ratings in the calculation of RWA credit risk is only  for claims on Governments of Other Countries, Public Sector Entities, Multilateral Development Banks and particular International Institutions, Banks, and Corporates.
Counterparty credit risk arises from Over the Counter (OTC)  derivative transactions and repo/reserve repo transactions, both on the trading book and the banking book.
The standardized approach is used to calculate credit risk of capital adequacy ratio for any exposures that cause counterparty credit risk.
Determination of credit limits related to counterparty  credit risks can be adjusted according to the needs of the counterparty, the Bank’s risk appetite, and any other applicable regulations, such as POJK No.32/POJK.03/2018 and No.38/POJK.03/2019 regarding Maximum Lending Limits and Large Fund Provisions for Commercial Banks.
Credit Risk Mitigation The preferred type of collateral accepted to mitigate credit risk is solid collateral deemed as cash or land and buildings.
These types of collateral have relatively high liquidity value and/or can be legally attached so that the Bank is able to liquidate collateral immediately if the debtor’s/debtor group’s loan becomes delinquent.
Collateral assessment for loans is performed by an  independent appraiser.
In remote areas where no independent appraiser is available, the appraisal will be  conducted by internal staff who are not involved in the processing of the loan.
To monitor the physical collateral pledged to BCA by the debtor, site visits are conducted periodically to review the status of the collateral.
The main guarantors/warrant providers are analyzed when  processing credit and creditworthiness is determined by applying the “Four Eyes” principle, where credit decisions are determined by two independent parties, the Business Development Unit and the Credit Risk Analysis Unit.
The credit mitigation technique focuses on primary collateral.
In addition, to mitigate possible credit risks, BCA’s loan portfolio is well diversiﬁed, both in credit category and by industry/economic sector.
Disclosure of Market Risk Exposure and  Implementation of Market Risk Management  Market Risk Management Organization  The Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors are responsible for ensuring that the implementation of risk management with regard to exchange rates and interest rates is in line with the Bank’s strategic direction, scale, and business characteristics as well as exchange rate and interest rate risk proﬁles.
This includes ensuring the integration of exchange rate and interest rate risk management with other risks that may affect the Bank’s risk position.
The Board of Directors delegates its authority and responsibility to the parties listed below:  Party  Authority and Responsibility ALCO Determines policies and strategies regarding foreign exchange and interest rates.
Risk Management Work Unit Supports ALCO in monitoring and measuring foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Treasury Division Manages the Bank’s overall operations in foreign currency transactions and interest rates on  the trading book: - Responsible for maintaining foreign currency Net Open Position (NOP) and mitigating  interest rates on the trading book and ensuring the Bank’s compliance with Bank Indonesia regulations regarding NOP.
- Responsible for managing trading marketable securities and foreign currency transactions  in line with customer needs and/or income considerations.
Regional Ofﬁces and Branches Manages foreign currency transactions in the respective regional ofﬁces/branches in  accordance with predetermined limits.
All regional/branch foreign currency transactions are covered by the Treasury Division.
Limits for each region/branch are determined in accordance with operational needs.
The calculation of market risk for BCA’s capital requirements uses the standard method of the OJK.
Trading Book and Banking Book Portfolio Management  Management of portfolios exposed to interest rate risk (on the trading book) and to foreign exchange risk is conducted by setting and monitoring the use of Nominal Limits (Securities, Net Open Position), Value at Risk Limits (VAR), and Stop Loss Limits.
The valuation method is based on closeout prices or market price quotations from independent sources, including the following:  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  155Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance • Indonesia Bond Pricing Agency (IBPA)   • Bloomberg Generic & Value (BGN & VAL)  • Exchange prices• Dealer screen prices• The most conservative prices quoted by at least two  brokers and/or market makers • The yield curve, in the even that market prices from  independent sources are not available.
Market Risk Measurement   For monitoring market risk (exchange rates and interest rates) daily, Value at Risk measurements are taken based on a full valuation historical method using a 250-day window of data at a 99% conﬁdence level.
For the calculation of minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), market risk is calculated based on the standardized method set by OJK.
Scope of Trading and Banking Book Portfolios  Accounted for in Capital Adequacy Ratio  The following is the scope of the portfolio coverage included  in the CAR calculations: • Exchange rate risk covers both the trading and banking  books.
Exchange rate risks can arise from foreign exchange transactions Today (TOD), Tomorrow (TOM), Spot, Forward, Swap, Domestic Non-Delivery Forward (DNDF) and Option (Structured Product) • Interest rate risk covers the trading book.
It can arise  from securities, Forward, and Swap transactions • Equity risk (for subsidiaries) considers the trading book.
It can arise from equity trading transactions that may be carried out by subsidiaries.
Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB)  Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB) occurs as a result of movements in the market interest rate that are against the Bank’s position or transactions, and which may affect both the Bank’s interest income and the economic capital value.
In performing IRRBB measurement, the Bank uses a gap report (repricing gap) that measures assets and liabilities that are interest rate sensitive in nature to be mapped within a certain period.
Mapping is conducted based on the remaining maturity  date for any instrument with a ﬁxed interest rate or on the remaining time up to the next interest rate adjustment for any instrument with a ﬂoating rate.
The Bank uses an earning approach and economic value approach to measure interest rate risk.
Monitoring and measurement of interest rate risk exposure on the banking book is submitted to the Board of Directors/ALCO on a monthly basis.
Anticipation of Market Risks on Foreign Currency and  Securities Transactions The steps taken to anticipate market risk for transactions associated with exchange rate and interest rate risk are to establish and control market risk limits such as Value at Risk (VaR) Limit, Nominal Limit, and Stop Loss Limit, as well as conducting stress tests in measuring risk.
In an effort to support the Bank Indonesia program on the Deepening of Financial Market Transactions, the Bank conducts risk management assessments and prepares policies and procedures for the development of various transactions.

RCSA has been implemented in all work units at branches and head ofﬁce that are identiﬁed as having signiﬁcant operational risks.
RCSA is aimed at instilling a risk culture and increasing risk  awareness as the main requirement of risk management.
With improving risk culture, every employee is expected to embed risk culture in their daily activities to minimize risk.
In RCSA methodology, work units at branches and head ofﬁce  identify and measure operational risks inherent to their work units, determine the controls that must be implemented to mitigate risks, then design follow-up action plans should there be residual risk with signiﬁcant value.
In addition to the RSCA methodology, the Bank has  implemented a Loss Event Database (LED) and Key Risk Indicator (KRI).
LED is designed to assist the Bank in monitoring, recording, and analyzing operational events that have occurred and could lead to losses so that the Bank can take corrective and preventive actions to minimize the possible risk of operational losses.
LED is also a means of operational risk loss data collection  used by the Bank to determine the allocation of capital charge from operational losses using the Standardized Approach.
Currently, LED has been implemented in all regional ofﬁces, branches, and work units at head ofﬁce.
KRI is a method used to provide an early warning signal in  the event of increased operational risk within a work unit.
All regional ofﬁces, branches, and work units at head ofﬁce are considered to have fairly signiﬁcant operational risks and have implemented KRI.
The KRI system has been further developed into a predictive risk management tool that can detect and respond to increased risks within work units.
The implementation of RCSA, LED and KRI methodologies is  supported by the Operational Risk Management Information System (ORMIS).
Mechanism for Operational Risk Mitigation To mitigate operational risks, the Bank:• Implements regular Risk Awareness Programs to  promote risk awareness to all BCA stakeholders • Sets and consistently updates policies, procedures, and  limits in accordance with organizational development, regulations, and prevailing laws • Has a Business Continuity Plan (BCP)• Owns an internal control system, implemented with the  four eyes principle and segregation of duty to reduce fraud potential.
Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, BCA has taken efforts  to minimize the impact of the pandemic risk as previously described in the Operational Risk section.

Measurement and Control of Liquidity Risk The measurement of liquidity risk is conducted comprehensively and regularly by monitoring cash ﬂow  projections, maturity proﬁle reports, liquidity ratios, and  stress test scenarios.
Stress testing is conducted based on  the Bank’s speciﬁc stress scenarios and general market stress  scenarios.
Liquidity risk is monitored to facilitate timely mitigation and to inform adjustments to the liquidity risk  management strategy as soon as any increase in liquidity risk  occurs.
The following activities are included in the liquidity risk  monitoring process:• Monitoring both internal and external early warning  indicators for events with the potential to increase liquidity risk • Monitoring funds and liquidity positions that include: - Interest rate strategy, investment alternatives  for fund owners, changes in customer behavior, changes in foreign exchange and interest rates offered by a primary competitor that could impact the fund structure, fund volatility, and core funds.
These changes should be monitored on a regular basis (daily, monthly, and annually).
- Daily monitoring of the liquidity position in respect  to Minimum Statutory Reserves Requirement (GWM), secondary reserves, and liquidity ratio.
Stress Testing Liquidity Risk Stress testing for liquidity risk is a test using certain scenarios of the Bank’s ability to meet liquidity needs during a crisis.
Stress tests are conducted based on a bank-speciﬁc stress scenario and a general market stress scenario.
Stress testing for speciﬁc stress scenarios within the Bank is carried out at least once every three months, while stress scenarios on the market are carried out at least once a year.
Stress testing is performed by considering several factors,  including events that have or have the potential to cause a liquidity crisis, duration (duration of events or stress conditions), and the severity of problems caused by these events.
The results of the liquidity risk stress test can then be used as input in reviewing policies and strategies for liquidity risk management, composition of assets, liabilities and/or administrative accounts, contingency funding plans, and limit setting. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 158 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH Contingency Funding Plan The Bank has designed a contingency funding plan as an action plan to deal with worsening bank liquidity conditions.
The action plan is arranged in several levels, namely level one (normal), level two (temporary liquidity squeeze) and level three (name crisis).
The action plan chosen at each level is adjusted to the  conditions during a crisis with the priority of speeding up obtaining liquidity and at a reasonable cost.
Emergency funding plans must be in line with the results of stress tests, evaluated, updated, and tested regularly to ensure a level of reliability.

Type of Risk  Summary 1 Credit Risk The global spread of COVID-19 since early 2020, as well as the decline in economic activities, had a  signiﬁcant impact on the performance and debtors’ ability to pay in all credit segments.
To maintain credit quality and to support the national economic recovery program, BCA has set several policies and provisions in accordance with government policies and regulatory, including providing interest subsidies to debtors that are deemed eligible, credit guarantees for MSMEs and non MSMes from government-appointed guarantors, and restructuring scheme to debtors affected by COVID-19.
BCA applies a disciplined risk management in lending, to maintain its NPL ratio relatively around 2.2%  at the end of 2021.
This level was higher than the previous year of 1.8%, and still within the limits of the Bank’s risk appetite.
This achievement was supported by the regulator’s policy in credit relaxation based on POJK No.11/POJK.03/2020, No.48/POJK.03/2020 and No.17/POJK.03/2021, National Economic Stimulus as a Countercyclical Policy for the Impact of the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019.
BCA continued to monitor an ongoing condition of debtors who have restructured their loans.
In line  with the Indonesian economic recovery, BCA noticed the several debtors which had recovered their business, and no need to continue the relaxation scheme that had been given previously In addition, BCA also booked the allowances for impairment losses on assets of Rp16.3 trillion in 2021, an  increase of 103.5% from Rp15.8 trillion in 2020.
This provisions was carried out in anticipating potential increases in credit risk amid the uncertainty on economic conditions.
The coverage ratio to LAR at the level of 14.6%.
In managing the credit portfolio (including risk concentration), BCA pays attention and evaluate the  implementation of lending diversiﬁcation, monitoring the use of credit limits to ensure no exceedances occurred, as well as monitoring credit growth and quality in each sectors.
BCA’s loan portfolio is well diversiﬁed, with exposures to each sectors was below 10% of BCA’s total loans. 2 Market Risk BCA conservatively manages its foreign currency risk exposure with a sustained Net Open Position (NOP) ratio.
BCA’s PDN position was 0.08%, far below the maximum 20% limit set by regulator.
BCA constantly monitors its foreign exchange transactions to comply with the regulatory requirements,  internal policies, Bank Indonesia Regulations (PBI) and Financial Services Authority Regulations (POJK).
Transactions processed through branch ofﬁces are monitored, recorded and reported to the Treasury Division, as the coordinator of the Bank’s foreign currency transactions.
Each branch ofﬁce is required to cover its own foreign currency exchange rate risk at the end of each working day, according to PDN tolerance limit set for the branch ofﬁces. 3 Operational Risk The COVID-19 pandemic has caused adjustments to internal work processes and bank’s services to customers.
To minimize operational risk due to these changes, BCA continued to conduct operational risk assessment, and implement the necessary mitigation measures to balance risk and service.
BCA managed IT-related operational risk by paying attention to reliability, security, availability and  timeliness to serve and protect the assets of customers and BCA.
BCA conducted operational risk assessment in each new product, service, and activity as well as changes  and developments.
In managing operational risk, BCA used the Operational Risk Management Information System (ORMIS),  a web-based application that including Risk Control Self-Assessment, Loss Event Database, and Key Risk Indicators.
In addition, BCA also conduct regular socialization to increase risk awareness in working units.
Currently, BCA is preparing the necessary infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements regarding  the calculation of Operational Risk Weighted Average using the standardized approach which will be implemented in January 2023. 4 Liquidity Risk BCA maintains an adequate liquidity position and monitors the balance between the Bank’s shortterm liabilities and short-term funds.
BCA ensures that it has sufﬁcient fund to meet short-term, liquid and low-risk placements, especially for risk-free placement of securities issued by Bank Indonesia.
Most of BCA’s liquidity comes from the collection of current and savings accounts (CASA) funds, with low  interest costs.
Amidst the economic setback that took place in 2021, CASA grew by 19.1% or Rp122.4 trillion and contributed to 78.9% of total third party funds.
High CASA ratio is one of BCA’s competitive advantages in facing future challenges, especially related to the low interest rate environment that is likely to happen in the future.
BCA recorded Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 62.0% at the end of year.
This was driven by strong CASA  growth, amid the decreasing demand in credit, combined with the increase in credit risk due to the impact of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) remained solid at 396.3% and 178.7% (bank only), respectively.
To maintain the overall position of its third party funds, BCA proactively reviews its interest rates on funds, in accordance with the Bank’s liquidity conditions.  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  165Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance No.
Type of Risk  Summary 5 Legal Risk BCA mitigates its legal risks, by applying the following items :  • Making a Legal Risk Management Policy and standardizing legal documents, as well as having  internal provisions governing the organizational structure and job description of GHK.
• Organizing forums of communication and socialization on:  - The impact of the new regulations on BCA banking activities- Various modus operandi of banking crimes and guidelines for relevant branch ofﬁces, regional  ofﬁces and head ofﬁce work units to legally handle the crimes.
• Registering BCA’s assets, including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of BCA banking products and  services, as well as rights to its land and buildings at competent authorities.
In addition, the Bank continues to monitor and take legal action for violations committed against BCA assets, including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
• Conducting legal defenses for civil and criminal cases that are currently on trials, monitoring the  progress of each case, analyzing the progress of the on-going trial case, and calculating the potential loss that may arise from each legal case. 6 Strategic Risk In order to identify and respond to changes from external and internal business environment, BCA takes the following measures: • Review the Bank’s Business Plan (RBB) periodically in accordance with the business developments  and the condition of the Indonesian economy.
When there is a need to update the strategic plan and business initiatives to correspond the changes in the business environment, the Bank may compile a Revised RBB based on the applicable regulations.
• Target setting for business aspects, considering the current economic landscape and predictions for  the coming years with an emphasis on the principle of prudence, taking into account the capacity/capability  of the Bank and the trend of competition from both banking and nonbanking sectors.
BCA’s strategy is formulated based on the regulation of Bank Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority,  and on other relevant regulations.
BCA also considers the impact of strategic risk on the Bank’s capital and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), using risk appetite, risk tolerance and consideration of BCA’s capabilities as the basis. 7 Reputation Risk BCA is capable in managing reputation risk during a crisis, as follows: • The Bank has a Crisis Management, which includes:  -  Crisis Management Policy, a strategy applied to manage crises or events that may disrupt  service operations and/or jeopardize BCA’s reputation.
-  Establishment of a Crisis Management Special Team, which is responsible for coordinating  during crisis management process, including the recovery process.
-  Crisis Communication Management, a media to coordinate communication about the  crisis to internal and external parties, including the mass media.

-  Crisis management provisions on emergency response, customer transaction services in times  of alert and crisis.
• The Bank has a business continuity plan and a disaster recovery plan, which both are designed to  minimize disruptions and speed up recovery process in the event of disaster.
• The Bank has a Secondary Operation Center as backup work area for critical work units to maintain  BCA’s business sustainability.
• The Bank has a backup system to prevent high risk business failure. 8 Compliance Risk BCA embraces a strong commitment to always comply with all applicable rules and regulations, and take remedial actions whenever needed.
This commitment is consistent with BCA’s compliance risk management strategy, which has a policy to always comply with applicable rules and regulations.
The Bank also takes proactive actions (ex-ante) in order to minimize the occurrence of violations and curative action (ex-post), for immediate improvement. 9 Intra-Group Transaction  RiskBCA monitors its Intra-Group Transaction Risk to ensure that the Intra-Group Transactions made conform to the principle of fairness, acceptable business practice, and all applicable regulations, and that all transactions are all well documented.
Based on the results of the recent assessments, the Bank’s Intra-group Transaction Risk has an insigniﬁcant  impact to the overall 10 Insurance Risk BCA also manages Insurance Risk since the Bank has a subsidiary engaged in the insurance business.
The assessment results suggest that the potential impact of BCA Insurance Risk on the Bank’s overall Conglomeration Financial performance is not signiﬁcant.

The Group measures fair values using the following hierarchy of methods: •  Level 1: inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments that the Group can access at  the measurement  date; •  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.
This cat egory includes instruments  valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instrument s in markets that  are not active; or other valuation techniques in which all signiﬁcant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data; •  Level 3: inputs that are unobservable.
This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inp uts not based on  observable data and the unobservable inputs have a signiﬁcant effect on the instrument’s valuation.
This category includes inst ruments that  are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which signiﬁcant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are requ ired to reﬂect  differences between the instruments.
Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities that are traded in active market are based on quoted market prices.
For  all other ﬁnancial  instruments, the Bank determines fair values using valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash ﬂow models, comparison with similar instruments for which ma rket observable  prices exist and other valuation models.
Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free interest rates, benchmark interest  rate, credit spreads and other variables used in estimating discount rates, bond prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and e xpected price  volatilities and correlations.3.

Disclosure of Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB) Exposure - Bank as Individual  - as of December 31, 2021 No.
Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) refers to the current or prospective risk to the bank’s capital and earnings a rising from  interest rates movements in the market as opposed to the banking book positions.
The IRRBB calculation uses two perspectives, n amely  the economic value perspective and earnings-based perspective.
The intention is to identify risks more accurately and to carry out  appropriate corrective actions.  2.
Presently, Bank does not have sufﬁcient long-term ﬁnancial resources to fund ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities.
Reg arding  these conditions, funding sources of ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities is calculated from the Core Deposit.
To mitigate risks, Bank has set nominal limits on ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities, limits on IRRBB and pricing stra tegies.  3.
Measurements of IRRBB individual are carried out on a monthly basis by using two (2) methods as follows: a.
measurement based on changes in economic value of equity, which measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the  economic value of the Bank’s equity (economic value perspective), and b.
measurement based on changes in net interest income, which measures the impact of interest rate changes on earnings of the Bank  (earnings-based perspective). 4.
Interest rate shock scenarios used by Bank in measuring IRRBB is in accordance with the standard interest rate shock scenario s, which is  stated in the Financial Services Authority Circular Letter No.12 /SEOJK.03/2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk Managemen t and  Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks.
Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Methods use six (6) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up,2)  parallel shock down,3)  steepener shock (short rates down and long rates up),4)  ﬂattener shock (short rates up and long rates down),5)  short rates shock up,6)  short rates shock down.
Net Interest Income (NII) Methods use two (2) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up,2)  parallel shock down. 5.
EVE method calculates the cash ﬂows of the principal amount and interest payments on the balance sheet positions that are sen sitive to  interest rates, which then discounted at the relevant interest rates.
The Bank does not calculate a commercial margin and spread components in the cash ﬂows.
EVE calculation uses notional cash ﬂows   multiplied by the reference rate (base rate) on the transaction date and then discounted by the risk-free rate at the reporting  date.
The IRRBB calculation uses a Core deposit, which is part of a stable Non Maturity Deposit with a very small change in interest rates  despite signiﬁcant changes in interest rates in the market.
Bank identiﬁes core deposit and non-core deposits from stable funds (retail transactional, retail non-transactional and wholesa le).
Placement of core deposit cash ﬂows carried out using uniform slotting on time-bucket over 1 (one) year with the length of peri od  for each category refers to FSA Circular Letter No. 12 / SEOJK.03 / 2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk Management and R isk  Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) for Commercia l  Banks.
The methodology to estimate prepayment rate for loans and early withdrawal rate for time deposits uses historical data within a  year.
Bank performs add-on calculations for automatic interest rate options on a ﬂoating rate mortgage loan with embedded caps by usi ng  Black-Scholes model.
Bank measures IRRBB for signiﬁcant currencies, IDR and USD.
In total IRRBB, the maximum negative (absolute) value of the two  currencies is aggregated. 6.
As of Dec 31 2021, IRRBB (EVE method) for BCA as individual decreased by 0.42% compared to Jun 30 2021, from 8.11% to 7.69%.
And  for NII Method increased by 5.49%, from 2.31% to 7.80%.
This was caused by the decrease in GAP between  rate sensitive assets ( RSA)  and rate sensitive Liabilities (RSL) by 15.70%.

b.1  Disclosure of Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB) Exposure - Bank Consolidated  - as of December 31, 2021 No.
Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) refers to the current or prospective risk to the bank’s capital and earnings a rising from  interest rates movements in the market as opposed to the banking book positions.
The IRRBB calculation uses two perspectives, n amely  the economic value perspective and earnings-based perspective.
The intention is to identify risks more accurately and to carry out  appropriate corrective actions.  2.
Presently, Bank does not have sufﬁcient long-term ﬁnancial resources to fund ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities.
Reg arding  these conditions, funding sources of ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities is calculated from the Core Deposit.
To mitigate risks, Bank has set nominal limits on ﬁxed-rate loans and banking book securities, limits on IRRBB and pricing stra tegies.  3.
Measurements of IRRBB consolidated are carried out on a quarterly basis by using two (2) methods as follows: a.
measurement based on changes in economic value of equity, which measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the eco nomic  value of the Bank’s equity (economic value perspective), and b.
measurement based on changes in net interest income, which measures the impact of interest rate changes on earnings of the Bank  (earnings-based perspective). 4.
Interest rate shock scenarios used by Bank in measuring IRRBB is in accordance with the standard interest rate shock scenario s, which is  stated in the Financial Services Authority Circular Letter No.12 /SEOJK.03/2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk Managemen t and  Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks.
Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Methods use six (6) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up,2)  parallel shock down,3)  steepener shock (short rates down and long rates up),4)  ﬂattener shock (short rates up and long rates down),5)  short rates shock up,6)  short rates shock down.
Net Interest Income (NII) Methods use two (2) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up,2)  parallel shock down. 5.
EVE method calculates the cash ﬂows of the principal amount and interest payments on the balance sheet positions that are sen sitive to  interest rates, which then discounted at the relevant interest rates.
The Bank does not calculate a commercial margin and spread components in the cash ﬂows.
EVE calculation uses notional cash ﬂows   multiplied by the reference rate (base rate) on the transaction date and then discounted by the risk-free rate at the reporting  date.
The IRRBB calculation uses a Core deposit, which is part of a stable Non Maturity Deposit with a very small change in interest rates  despite signiﬁcant changes in interest rates in the market.
Bank identiﬁes core deposit and non-core deposits from stable funds (retail transactional, retail non-transactional and wholesa le).
Placement of core deposit cash ﬂows carried out using uniform slotting on time-bucket over 1 (one) year with the length of peri od  for each category refers to FSA Circular Letter No. 12 / SEOJK.03 / 2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk Management and R isk  Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) for Commercia l  Banks.
The methodology to estimate prepayment rate for loans and early withdrawal rate for time deposits uses historical data within a  year.
Bank performs add-on calculations for automatic interest rate options on a ﬂoating rate mortgage loan with embedded caps by usi ng  Black-Scholes model.
Bank measures IRRBB for signiﬁcant currencies, IDR and USD.
In total IRRBB, the maximum negative (absolute) value of the two  currencies is aggregated. 6.
As of Dec 31 2021, IRRBB (EVE method) for BCA as consolidated decreased by 0.38% compared to Jun 30 2021, from 8.01% to 7.63% .
And for NII Method increased by 5.30%, from 2.12% to 7.42%.
This was caused by the decrease in GAP between  rate sensitive asse ts  (RSA) and rate sensitive Liabilities (RSL) by 12.75%.

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON NSFR Analysis on Bank Only Financial Statement •  Based on calculations, the value of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) - Individual as of 31 Dec 2021 increased by 0.89% wh en  compared to that of the period of 30 Sep 2021; namely from 179.92% (30 Sep’21) to 180.81% (31 Dec’21).
The increase in the NSFR  value  was due to a rise in the Available Stable Funding (ASF) component of 4.44% (Rp43.39 trillion), which was greater than the incre ase in  the Required Stable Funding (RSF) component of 3.93% (Rp21.34 trillion).
The increase in the ASF component was mainly attribute d to  an increase in the weighted value of deposits provided by individual, small businesses,  funding from corporate customers of Rp 38.55  trillion, and an increase in the capital adequacy ratio of Rp4.76 trillion.
Meanwhile, the rise in the RSF component was mainly  due to  an increase in loans classiﬁed as current and under special mention (performing loans) and marketable securities amounting to R p25.88  trillion.
• BCA’s NSFR ratio on an individual basis currently meets the minimum requirement of 100%.

Individuals and businesses have turned to digital networks for their banking needs, and for many this has become the new norm, even as the pandemic shows signs of subsiding.
BCA implements a wide range of individualized approaches  to meet the varied needs of different customers, striking an appropriate balance between digital channels and the established physical network.
Digital Banking as the New Norm The global pandemic has accelerated the growth of digital banking transactions.
As of 2021, around 88% of transactions at BCA are done via digital channels.
Our “Banking From Home” campaign and new services have encouraged the shift towards digital banking, as indicated by the number of online account openings via the BCA Mobile app, which reached 3.2 million in 2021, grow to nearly double from the previous year.
Digital banking is also transforming the way we will  serve customers at our branches in the near future.
The implementation of the future branch model has reached around 87% of the bank’s branches and will be 100% accomplished by 2022, optimizing digital technology and bringing rich digital experience for customers.
For example, the CS digital machine lets customers  get card replacements in less than 5 minutes.
In the hybrid ecosystem,  BCA has adopted different approaches to meet various customer needs, balancing its digital channels and strong physical network.
Along with these developments, BCA continues to improve  the roles of its customer service, teller and back ofﬁce staff to provide an exceptional customer experience across BCA channels.
The competencies of in-branch staff are continually developed through various training and skills-development programs.
Selective Expansion of the Physical Network Despite the growth of digital banking, the branch network remains a major channel for BCA’s business growth because it enables a more personalised interaction with customers.
The value of BCA’s branch network cannot be separated from the importance of the team that assists customers with their transition to digital transactions, which are a part of the hybrid ecosystem at BCA branches.
Keeping in mind the ongoing process of digitalization,  BCA carried out an analysis before selectively expanding its physical network, focusing on a compact branch format to establish a ﬂexible yet efﬁcient network.
As of the end of 2021, BCA has a total of 1.334 ofﬁces (137  Main Branch Ofﬁces, 1.105 Permanent Sub-Branch Ofﬁces, 70 Mobile Sub-Branch Ofﬁces, and  22 Functional ofﬁces).
There are a total of 18.034 BCA ATMs, mostly comprising cash recycling machines (CRM) and multi-functional ATMs.
The focus of expanding the ATM network is on replacing the multi-function ATMs with CRMs to allow customers to both deposit and withdraw cash.
In line with the Future Branch model, BCA has gradually  introduced self-assisted machines at its branches, such as STAR Teller, which improves the efﬁciency of banking transactions by supporting tellers when completing cash deposits and withdrawals at the branches.
Quality Services and Operations Customers are the beating heart of BCA’s business.
To build customer loyalty and become the Bank of choice, BCA emphasizes improvements to its service quality, enhancing customer experience, and strengthening customer engagement. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  267Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance The growing number of digital transactions requires   diverse assistance to ensure customer satisfaction.
In 2021, Halo BCA, a solution service center, launched the Halo BCA App, providing an easy way for customers from Indonesia   or overseas to contact the Bank using VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) technology.
The Halo BCA App complements Halo BCA’s existing points of contact, which include various social media accounts, WhatsApp and webchat channels, e-mail, and twitter.
Halo BCA also has Digital Relationship Ofﬁcers (DRO) who contact customers regularly under the 2-2-2 concept (two days, two weeks, and two months) to build stronger engagement and maintain trust-based relationships.
The position of a Solution Assistant (SOLA), a customer  relationship assistant under Halo BCA, was developed in 2019 to focus on segment-based relationships and provide services according to customer proﬁles.
SOLA serves the upper mass customers, while also increasing the business potential from this segment.
BCA has set up a SMART SOLUTION program to ensure quality  services and operations.
Introduced in 2001, SMART stands for Sigap  (active), Menarik  (attractive), Antusias  (enthusiastic),  Ramah  (friendly), and Teliti  (thorough).
The SOLUTION  program was added in 2010 with the principles of Simak (attentiveness), Open-minded, Lengkap  (completeness),  Utamakan kebutuhan nasabah  (prioritization of Customer’s  needs), Telling-solutions, Initiative, and ON-time follow-ups.
Following Government’s social restriction regulations, in  2021 BCA implemented strict health protocols for its in-branch services and operations.
BCA’s security team was available to assist the customers, ensuring their safety and convenience when making transactions at the branches.
Weekend banking remained available throughout 2021 to provide convenience for customers.
Future Development Plans To meet the needs of its customers, BCA will continue balancing its digital and physical networks.
Going forward, BCA will continue to develop its physical network in selected regions that are not covered by the existing network and/or are in emerging areas, developing the infrastructure needed to provide banking services that cannot be delivered through electronic or digital channels.
The future branch model, which relies heavily on automation  and digital devices, will be expanded with new features.
Banking services will be provided chieﬂy through digital technology, such as online reservations and digital forms on the e-Branch app; account opening via e-Service; cash deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions using the STAR Teller (teller-assisted machine) and dual-screen tablets; and many other self-service facilities at the branches.
Furthermore, BCA’s Customer eXperience Ofﬁcers (CXO) will assist the customers with other products and service offerings.
BCA consistently utilizes the latest technology to enhance  customer experience, while striving for operational excellence and optimum branch productivity.
It is BCA’s commitment to deliver simpler, faster, and safer in-branch transactions and services to its customers. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 268 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH BUSINESS SUPPORT Information T echnology Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in early 2020,  digital transactions have continued to grow, and banking  from home has become the new standard.
BCA, as the  leading transaction bank, continues to bring the best digital  experience to its customers through product innovation  that caters to their needs and adapts to trends.
The Bank  consistently invests in Information Technology (IT) and  Security to ensure the reliability, stability, and security of its  systems.
Serving a huge number of customer transactions, BCA  prioritises ensuring the IT system is “Always ON” with zero  downtime.
The Bank has strengthened its IT systems with  the addition of a new data centre, the modernization of  IT infrastructure and core systems, and the formulation of  a special team that is on standby 24/7 to maintain system  and service availability.
Along with the digitalization, the  cyberthreat landscape is also growing.
BCA strengthens its  cybersecurity posture to protect customers’ transactions  and data from fraud and cybercriminals in order to increase  customer trust while using digital banking.
Innovation for Customer Satisfaction BCA emphasized innovation in providing the best banking  solutions for various customer needs, such as payments,  deposits, investments, loans, ﬁnancial planning, and many  more.

The micro services architecture allows for the scalable, rapid  and secure implementation of new features for myBCA and  has also been applied to many other applications in the BCA  ecosystem.
With the rapid growth of digital transactions, BCA has  implemented big data to record and analyse data sets in  order to have a better understanding of customer needs and  preferences.
The Relationship Management Platform is one  such initiative.
It analyses and identiﬁes the right products  and services for each customer based on their speciﬁc needs.
This will ensure optimal customer satisfaction and will streamline the bank’s efforts to build better relationships  with customers.
Ensuring Service Quality through Increased  Capabilities  BCA’s primary IT focus has always been making sure that IT  services are reliable (“Always On”).
To that end, the Bank  implemented the High Availability System strategy by  adopting cloud technology, building new a data center, and  continuously modernizing the IT infrastructure and security.
To support excellence in IT operations and availability,  BCA applied automatic 24/7 real-time monitoring tools  by optimizing data analytics and artiﬁcial intelligence for  preventive problem detection.
These initiatives enable us to  increase system availability, reliability and security, while also  increasing the capacity for BCA to serve more customers in  the future. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  269Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance BCA continues to develop its new in-country data centre to  anticipate the growth of digital transactions and integration  with subsidiaries.
BCA and its subsidiaries will share resources  in data center operations, infrastructure, network, and  security, which will support a reliable and secure IT system  across the BCA group.
In 2021, BCA accomplished the  infrastructure development of “Halo Semarang”, a call  centre located in Semarang, to serve customers more quickly.
Various technologies employed by BCA—including  Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Optical Character  Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP),  Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and  Video Surveillance—have improved the bank’s operational  processes, an important factor in its continuous pursuit of  excellence.
Demand for digitalization and automation has also increased  signiﬁcantly, driving our need to adopt new technology and  processes in anticipation of the changing banking trends.
One of BCA’s approaches is the implementation of the Mini  Company initiative, which supports faster IT implementation  by forming dedicated and self-managed “scrum teams”.
These scrum teams consist of various roles and cross functional  units for quick decisions and faster development processes.
In  2021, more than 50 Mini Company teams have been formed,  implementing more than 8,500 IT features together.
While adopting a Work From Anywhere (WFA) protocol,  BCA enhanced its ﬂexible and digital collaborative working  environment with state-of-the-art security solutions, such  as VPN with 2-factor authentication combined with limiting  USB port access, balancing productivity and security.
To  improve working process efﬁciency in all working units, BCA  continued to develop the Citizen Developer concept, which  allows each working unit to develop and manage dedicated  applications or systems to support their performance.
Citizen  Developer provides the capability for the non-IT user to  develop simple and secure applications for internal use – the  initiative results with more than 100 applications built by  users. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 270 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH BUSINESS SUPPORT Information T echnology Sustainable Improvement in Security BCA’s information security is ISO 27001:2013 certiﬁed  to ensure its information security management system  best practices are maintained.
Striving for continuous  improvement in cybersecurity, the Bank is committed to  improving its infrastructure, network, application, and data  protection.
Strengthening the Security Monitoring Center  and cybersecurity risk management for digital transactions  are also part of improving cybersecurity vigilance.
Since social engineering is becoming more sophisticated,  cybersecurity awareness has always been the Bank’s key  focus.
BCA consistently increases customers’ awareness  through frequent webinars, social media, and the corporate  website, and simultaneously conducts e-learning, phishing  and smishing simulation for all employees.
To improve  cybersecurity governance, the implementation of policies,  standards, procedures, and practices have been enforced  throughout the organization.
Preventing data breaches from the use of personally owned  devices for work-related activities (so called ‘Bring Your Own  Device’ or BYOD), BCA applies mobile device management  segmenting, separating the corporate data from private  data.
To strengthen BYOD security, BCA has implemented  mobile threat prevention security solutions.
In order to safeguard customers’ data, BCA implemented  data security solutions such as data loss prevention policy,  procedure and technology to prevent data leakage, masking  sensitive data to mitigate data overexposure, as well as  utilizing machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence database  activity monitoring to detect anomalies in data access.
To ensure the protection of customers’ transactions,  BCA utilizes the latest technology to secure Internet  Banking transactions, including the capability to detect  a transaction that is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle.
Security Orchestration and Automation Response (SOAR)  orchestrates automatic response for all detected anomalies.
With the increasing needs of handling fraudulent banking  transactions, the Bank has begun using Security Information  & Event Management (SIEM) to correlate events for further  visibility against suspicious activities.
BCA regularly conducts security incident drills to ensure its  readiness against potential cyberattacks and to improve its  cyber resilience.
Future Development Plans BCA has witnessed an exponential increase in the number  of transactions through digital channels, and this trend is  expected to continue in line with technological developments  and shifts in customer behavior.
BCA will continue to invest  in IT capability and to develop employee competencies in  digital ﬁeld to support the achievement of the Bank’s targets.
There are opportunities for improvements to business and  operational processes, focusing on automation, integration  and data-driven analysis to sustain business growth in the  long run.
For the next three years, BCA will focus on ensuring the IT  system is “Always ON” with zero downtime and providing  reliable services to customers.
To achieve this very important  initiative, BCA is simultaneously developing its new data  center, modernizing hardware and software, and improving  infrastructure to ensure a high-availability system. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  271Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance To best enable business growth, BCA will extend its reach  with regard to collaborations with business partners through  open banking Application Programming Interface (API)  and with ﬁntech companies—in synergy with its subsidiary,  CCV—to expand the digital ﬁnance ecosystem.
The Bank is  also committed to supporting the implementation of the  regulator’s initiatives, such as BI-FAST and Open Banking.
As WFA becomes a new standard way of working, BCA  continues enhancing efﬁciency in the digital workplace, developing remote working hub ofﬁces, and implementing  process automation using artiﬁcial intelligence to improve  operational efﬁciency and service quality at front-end and  back-end processes.
BCA continues to develop its cybersecurity to support better  business innovation, which focuses on three aspects: people,  process, and technology.
All of these initiatives will enable  the Bank to adapt with the evolving cyberthreat landscape  and more sophisticated cyberattacks. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk272 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights Corporate Profile Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate GovernanceEconomic Review The economy showed an ongoing trend of recovery in 2021,  despite disruptions from the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the middle of the year.
After nearly two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy managed to achieve positive growth compared to 2020, with major economies, such as the US, China, and the European Union booking growth of 5.7%, 8.1%, and 5.1% (est.
FY-2021), respectively.
Economic recovery was supported by robust pent-up demand, which has driven up commodity prices amid global supply disruptions.
In the midst of economic recovery, the world faced global  inflation, stemming from supply chain disruption and increased energy prices.
In response, the US Federal Reserve began to tighten policy, while planning an increase of the Fed Funds Rate in 2022, anticipated to be around 75-100 bps.
Besides benefitting from the increase in exports, Indonesia  also saw an improvement in domestic demand, which contributed to 3.7% GDP growth compared to -2.1% in 2020.
The growth was held back by the rapid spread of the Delta variant, but it rebounded in line with the increasing vaccination rate, which improved mobility and led to a wider reopening of economic activities.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, economic recovery continued albeit clouded by increasing COVID-19 cases in several countries as the Omicron variant began to spread.

Bank Indonesia  (BI) continued to keep the balance between growth and  macroeconomic risks with a low benchmark policy rate of  3.50%, while maintaining stability in the government bond  and foreign exchange markets amid global volatility. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 274 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH Banking Sector Review Positive economic conditions supported the banking  industry’s performance.
Liquidity remained ample during  the pandemic, in line with the aforementioned policies.
Therefore, in 2021, third party funds grew 12.2% to Rp7,479  trillion.
Capital has been a major factor underpinning the  performance of the Indonesian banking industry for the past  decade, as reﬂected by the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at  25.7%.
Another positive sign was loan growth, which was  positive at 5.2% in 2021, after contracting in 2020.
This  growth was backed up by a manageable Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio of 3.0%.
Meanwhile, the restructured loan  ratio has begun to decline from the high rate at the start of  the pandemic.
To support the banking industry in the settlement of bad  loans, OJK through POJK No. 17/POJK.03/2021 extended  the banking credit restructuring relaxation policy for loans categorized as “Current” for the second time, from  March 2022 to March 2023.
This was a positive decision in  maintaining economic momentum.
When ﬁrst issued, the  credit restructuring relaxation regulation was effective until  March 2021.
With improving economic conditions globally and  domestically, BCA is conﬁdent the banking sector has the  potential to continue growing in 2022, in terms of both  lending and transactions.
This is also supported by the  government’s proactive approach to managing the pandemic  and various long-term positive catalysts, such as middle-class  income growth and Indonesia’s favorable demographic, with  large portions of productive-age population.
Loan growth  is expected to improve along with economic recovery.
BCA is also optimistic that the increasing digitalization in  Indonesian banking will beneﬁt the banking sector and drive  further growth in the future. 2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  275Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance BCA Financial Performance Overview 2021 BCA reported a net proﬁt growth of 15.8% to Rp31.4 trillion  in 2021, in line with the domestic economic recovery from the downturn cycle over the course of COVID-19 pandemic.
Credit demand recovered gradually, while a strong growth in CASA funds contributed to the growth of earning assets, underpinning the Bank’s operating income performance.
Amid the acceleration of digitalization, BCA continued to  drive innovations and collaborations with e-commerce and ﬁntech ﬁrms in order to expand the Bank’s ecosystem as well as to increase number of customers and transaction volume.
Solid performance of BCA’s transaction banking strengthened CASA core funds, which recorded a 19.1% growth in 2021.
The ratio of CASA to total third party funds reached 78.9%, among the highest in the Indonesia’s banking industry.
As of December 31, 2021, total third party funds increased 16.1% to reach Rp968.6 trillion.

Loans remained the largest component that contributed 55.3% of total Earning Assets at the end of 2021 despite loan demand had not fully recovered due to the pandemic.
Higher growth of Earning Assets was recorded in Placements with Bank Indonesia and Other Banks and in Securities which mostly consisted of Government Bonds and Bank Indonesia’s short-term instruments including Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell.
CASH, CURRENT ACCOUNTS WITH BANK INDONESIA  & CURRENT ACCOUNTS WITH OTHER BANKS Cash and Current Accounts with Bank Indonesia grew 72.6%  to Rp89.4 trillion in 2021 from Rp51.8 trillion in the previous year.
The cash balance decreased 2.9% to Rp23.6 trillion from Rp24.3 trillion, with Rupiah denominated cash balance contributing 97.1% of total cash.
Cash balance in Rupiah included cash at Automated Teller Machines (ATM) stood at Rp8.0 trillion.
Current Accounts with Bank Indonesia in 2021 was recorded  at Rp65.8 trillion, an increase of 139.4% from 2020.
This increase was due to the new BI regulation reintroducing a requirement of additional current accounts for banks to meet  the Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) in stages, effective May 1, 2021.
The new regulation required RIM no lower than or equal to 84% and a maximum of or equal to 94%.
BCA is required to increase the Current Account with Bank Indonesia because the Bank’s RIM ratio is below the applicable regulations.
In 2021, the average Primary Rupiah Statutory Reserves were recorded at 3.15%, and the daily foreign currency Statutory Reserves at 2.00%.
Meanwhile, Current Accounts with Other Banks decreased by 3.1% to Rp11.6 trillion from Rp12.0 trillion.
Current Accounts with Other Banks were placed with leading international banks.
PLACEMENTS WITH BANK INDONESIA & OTHER  BANKS In 2021, Placements with BI and Other Banks increased 83.7%  to Rp87.1 trillion compared to the previous year’s Rp47.5 trillion.
The increase was primarily due to placements in Bank Indonesia Instruments, such as Bank Indonesia Term Deposit as one of liquidity placements.
Most of the Placements with Bank Indonesia and Other Banks were short-term instruments with tenor of less than 3 months.
SECURITIES At the end of 2021, placements in Securities reached Rp371.3 trillion, an increase of 9.4% from Rp339.4 trillion in the previou s  year.
Placements in Securities consisted of Investment Securities and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell (reverse repo).
The increase in Securities was due to higher third party funds growth compared to credit growth.
However, in line with recovering mobility, business and economic activities, placements in Securities and Bank Indonesia are expected to be gradually   replaced by credit growth.

Most of the corporate bond issuers were BCA debtors in the petrochemical sector, palm oil plantation and paper.  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 278 Management Discussion and Analysis Management Report Financial Highlights &RUSRUDWH3URˉOH Meanwhile, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell  (reverse repo) were recorded at Rp147.1 trillion, an increase of 0.2% compared to the previous year at Rp146.8 trillion.
The reverse repo was almost entirely Bank Indonesia instruments with Government bonds as the transaction underlying.
Reverse Repo only increased slightly compared to last year’s position as larger liquidity was allocated to Placements with Bank Indonesia and Other Banks, Cash and Current Accounts with Bank Indonesia and Investment Securities.
LOANS Along with mobility recovery in 2021, BCA’s loan portfolio increased 8.3% to Rp622.0 trillion, mainly supported by the growth in corporate loans and mortgages.

Consumer loans recorded an annual increase of 4.3% to  Rp123.2 trillion, compared to the previous year’s decrease of 10.9%.
Consumer loan growth was supported by recovering mortgage demand and government incentives.
BCA took this opportunity to host the BCA Expoversary Online from February 2021 to March 2021, as well as the KPR Online Expo and Virtual Auto Show from September to November 2021.
These initiatives resulted in total applications of Rp50.1 trillion, driving a 7.2% growth of BCA mortgages to   Rp84.2 trillion.  2021 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk  279Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment Corporate Governance Vehicle loans still recorded a decline of 3.9% to Rp27.2 trillion, due to the limited supply of cars in Indonesia to meet highe r  consumer demand as a result of the lack of automobile parts.
However, this was an improvement compared to previous year, which had a correction of 22.2%.
The government’s PPnBM (luxury tax) relaxation policy encouraged a recovery in vehicle loan demand in 2021.

LAR comprises Current Restructured loans, Special Mention and Non-Performing.
In 2021, BCA’s total LAR was recorded at 14.6% of total loans, down from 18.8% in the previous year.
The improvement in the LAR ratio was supported by a decrease in restructured loans in line with slowing down of COVID-19 cases, as well as improving mobility and business activities of a number of debtors.
Around 77.5% of LAR was attributable to the business  segment, with the rest of 22.5% coming from the consumption segment.

The decrease in Interest Expense was contributed by lower Interest Expense on Savings and Time Deposits, which fell by a signiﬁcant 52.0% and 22.8%, respectively, amid the downward trend in interest rates in 2021.
Although deposit rates declined, BCA posted a high increase in Third Party Funds, up increased by 16.1% compared to the previous year, mainly supported by growth in CASA funds.
With the high growth of Third Party Funds, BCA placed  investments in low-risk ﬁnancial instruments, such as Government Bonds and short-term instruments with BI.
Higher placement on these instruments boosted Interest Income from Securities and from Placement with Bank Indonesia and Other Banks, up by 24.1% and 53.3% respectively compared to the previous year.
This growth was able to compensate for the decline in Interest Income stream  from Loans amid the downward trend in interest rates and  modest loan volume.
Taking into account BI’s lower interest rate policy and ample  liquidity condition throughout 2021, BCA made several adjustments to interest rates, including the decrease on deposit rate of 125 bps and saving rate of 13 bps.
BCA’s cost of funds stood at the level of 1.0%,  decreased by 39 bps   from the previous year.
On earning assets, yields decreased from 6.9% in 2020 to  6.0% in 2021, along with lower yields on Loans, Securities and short-term Placements with Bank Indonesia and Other Banks.
Furthermore, Net Interest Margin (NIM) was recorded at 5.1%, or 60 bps lower than in 2020.

The growth mainly came from a rebound in recurring Fees and Commission, supported by accelerating growth in transaction banking.
This was reﬂected in a 11.6% or Rp1.5 trillion increase of Fee and Commission Income.
Meanwhile, Net Trade Transaction Revenue decreased signiﬁcantly by 35.6% or Rp1.5 trillion, mainly due to a one-off gain booked in 2020, coming from  the sale of mutual fund.
Other Operating Income was recorded at Rp4.9 trillion,  up 38.0% compared to the previous year, supported by the proceeds from written-off loans recovery, amounting to Rp0.5 trillion, and higher insurance premium income at  subsidiaries, BCA Life and BCA Insurance, worth Rp0.4 trillion.

The increase in various transaction banking service activities contributed signiﬁcantly to the growth of Fee and Commission Income, in line with the growing number of customer accounts and high volume of digital-based transactions.
Deposits from Customers increased by Rp523 billion or  10.8%, mainly came from monthly administration fees from current and savings accounts, as well as BCA virtual accounts.
Higher monthly administration income was supported by a 16.4% growth in the number of customers account, reaching more than 28 million accounts.
Revenue from Credit Cards, including revenue from auto-debit switching, recorded  a growth of 15.0%, supported by growth in transaction volume through network switching activities and credit card transaction recovery.
