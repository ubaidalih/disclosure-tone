According to the report from Bank Indonesia, Indonesia's sluggish economy started to rebound in 2021, which was marked by the improvements in a number of sectors.
This momentum is in line with the data of Statistics  Indonesia (BPS), which recorded the recovery of Indonesia’s economy throughout 2021 with a positive growth at 3.7% (yoy), after having contracted to 2.1% (yoy) in 2021.
World Bank projects that Indonesia’s economy growth may rise to 5.2% in 2022, assuming that Indonesia is capable in avoiding the spike of severe COVID-19 cases, having up to 70% vaccination rate in 2022 across provinces and maintaining cooperative monetary and fiscal policies.
The national economic recovery in 2021 was mainly  supported by the extensive COVID-19 vaccination  program, which drove the improvement of the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and mobility surpassing the pre-pandemic level.
In the second half of 2021, the government imposed the public activity restrictions in major cities across Indonesia, such as Jakarta, due to the emergence of the COVID-19 involving the Delta variant.
Nevertheless, vaccination program was still carried out by collaborating with a number of parties, including private sectors.
The economic performance started to recover since  the fourth quarter of 2021 until the end of the year.
This improvement was certainly an encouraging performance for various industries in Indonesia.
Nevertheless, all industries must remain vigilant amid all situations.
Plastic products derived from petrochemicals remains as the key role and are used as the main ingredients in downstream industries, such as the automotive sector, household appliances, building materials as well as the agriculture and horticulture sectors.
According to the projection from Nexant, an  independent research institute, regarding the Indonesia’s petrochemical sector, the consumption of Polyolefins in Indonesia, which currently stands at 13 million tons per capita this year, is projected to grow at 4.1% CAGR from 2019 to 2035.
It is higher than Polyolefin consumption in Asia, which currently stands at 21 million tons, with a projected CAGR growth of 3.6% over the same period.
Thus, the projected growth of the domestic petrochemical industry is quite promising.
In the electricity sector, the Government of Indonesia  continues to focus on providing electrical energy supplies to people across Indonesia.
According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources report, at the beginning of 2011, the national electrification ratio which is the number used to measure the ratio of the number of people who have sources of electric lighting, both from PLN and non-PLN, only reached 67.15%.
In 2021, the national electrification ratio stood at 99.45%, implying there are more Indonesians that have instant access to electricity compared with the previous decade.
The government of Indonesia continues to focus  on reducing CO2 emissions in the electric power sector.
Geothermal energy plays a key role in supporting Indonesia to achieve this particular vision.
Indonesia is estimated to contain the world's largest geothermal energy reserves, and most of them are still unexplored.
According to the Electricity Supply Business Plan of PT PLN (RUPTL PLN) for 2021-2030, the government continue to increase the mix of renewable energy, including geothermal to 20.9 Giga Watt or 51.6% of the total planned construction of new power plants in Indonesia of 40.6 Giga Watts.
The Company's energy business sector continues to focus on providing electricity with lower emissions across Indonesia. 104  laporan TaHUnan 2021 2021 annUal reporT   105 tINJAuAN  KINERJA  OPERASI  PER SEgMEN  uSAhA Operational Performance Review by Business Segment Perseroan melalui entitas anaknya,  menjalankan  usaha di segmen petrokimia, energi, properti, perhotelan, penyewaan tangki dan dermaga.

The Polyethylene plant achieve dan operating rate of 94%, followed by 92% at the Polypropylene plant, 89% at the Styrene Monomer plant, and 84% at the Butadiene plant.
Meanwhile, the MTBE plant achieve an operating  rate of 46% mainly due to the obligation to fulfill the off-take raffinate agreement which was considered in the Final Investment Decision of the project, and Butene-1 recorded an operating rate of 80% throughout 2021.

In terms of volume, the Company's product sales in  2021 reached 2,211 KT, decreased by 0.5% compared with 2,222 KT in 2020.
The decrease was mainly due to the Turn Around Maintenance at the Company's Polypropylene plant.
