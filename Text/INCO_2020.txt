Global Nickel Market Overview and Company Performance Nickel is used in the manufacture of stainless steel, alloys,  plating, batteries and other materials in the construction,  automotive, industrial and energy industries.
The world’s  nickel needs are supplied by several countries.
In 2020 there  were 11 major nickel supplier countries, including Indonesia,  which supplied 760,000 metric tons.
Indonesia supplies almost  30% of the world’s needs tons.
Operational Overview The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia affected the mineral and  coal (minerba) sector, resulting in the Indonesian Government  revising its target for Non-Tax State Revenue (PNBP) in the  mineral and coal sector from its initial target of over Rp40  trillion down to Rp31.4 trillion.
At the end of 2020, the PNBP  received reached Rp34.6 trillion or 110% of the target1.
The COVID-19 pandemic not only affected the PNBP , but also  investments in the mineral and coal sector.
In the 2020 Mining  Work Plan and Budget (RKAB) the investment target was set at  US$7.7 billion, but the realization by the end of the year only  reached US$4 billion or 48% lower than the target2.
At the  same time, several projects were interrupted, resulting in total  2020 investments being lower than the US$6.5 billion reached  in 2019.
The impact of the pandemic was also felt in the metal and  mineral mining subsector, including nickel.
However, the  economic recovery in China helped slowly drive an increase in  world nickel demand, with the London Metal Exchange (LME)  reporting that in the second half of 2020 nickel prices had  begun to rise.
This provided positive sentiment that supported  the Company’s performance.

At the start of the reporting period, world nickel prices corrected  due to the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, in the next quarter, nickel prices increased, triggered  partly by China’s economic performance that showed signs of  recovery in Q3/2020, and this brought a positive sentiment  to the global nickel market.
The movement in the Chinese  infrastructure sector increased demand for nickel, and  subsequently an increase in nickel prices on the world market.
The weakening of the US dollar also strengthened commodity  prices such as nickel.
The world nickel price improvement during the reporting  period had a positive effect on the Company’s performance.
In  addition, PT Vale had also revised its nickel in matte production  volume from 71,000 tons to 73,000 tons.
National Nickel Mining Policy Overview and Company  Performance The export ban for nickel ore with a grade below 1.7% that  took effect from January 1, 2020 resulted in a higher nickel ore  uptake for domestic needs.
Based on the Ministry of Energy  and Mineral Resources (ESDM) report, the national nickel ore  production in semester I/2020 reached 15.85 million tons.
Domestic nickel ore uptake is intended for nickel derivative  products, including the nickel in matte produced by PT Vale.
All nickel ore requirements for nickel in matte production is  obtained from the Company’s mining operations.
Company production in Q1/2020 reached 17,614 tons, 35%  higher than the 13,080 tons production in Q1/2019, but 14%  lower than the production in Q4/2019 following planned  maintenance activities.
Sales in Q1/2020 reached 16,713 tons,  21% higher than Q1/2019, and 21% lower than Q4/2019.
During this time, the Company took a number of steps to  anticipate and reduce the potential impact of the spread of  COVID-19 on its operations.
In Q1/2020, we recorded EBITDA  of US$54.9 million.
Production of nickel in matte in Q2/2020 reached 18,701 tons,  6% higher than Q1/2020.
Sales of nickel in matte in Q2/2020  reached 19,887 tons, 19% higher than Q1/2020.
Overall,  production in semester I/2020 was 18% higher than the  production in semester I/2019, and the number of shipments  in semester I/2020 grew 19% compared to semester I/2019.
The Company recorded EBITDA of US$59.4 million in Q2/2020,  higher than Q1/2020, mainly driven by higher sales.
The Company’s performance in Q3/2020 improved despite  the COVID-19 pandemic situation.
Production in Q3/2020  reached 19,477 tons, 4% higher than Q2/2020.
The number  of shipments in Q3/2020 reached 19,954 tons, higher than  Q2/2020.
Meanwhile, EBITDA in Q3/2020 amounted to  US$84.7 million, an increase compared to Q2/2020 due to the  higher average nickel price.
Production in Q4/2020 was 16,445 tons, 16% and 20% lower  than the production volume in Q3/2020 and Q4/2019 which  was caused by planned maintenance activities, especially  the replacement of transformers in electric furnace 4 from  November to December 2020.
In the Q4/2020, the Company’s cash costs of revenues were  higher, EBITDA was lower but nickel prices rebounded.
During the reporting period, the Company continued its  feasibility studies for project developments:  1.

Nickel Ore Mining Operations Segment The nickel ore mining process starts with nickel ore geological  surveys, and then continues with mine planning and mining  operations, including post-mining rehabilitation.
Mining  operations finish with the storage of screen station product  (SSP) in the stockpiles.
Mining operations are carried out in Sorowako, Nuha District,  East Luwu Regency, South Sulawesi, using an open-mining  technique.
At the end of 2020, the mining operations area  covered the East Block, West Block and Petea.
The Company  has a policy of limiting land opening for mining activities.
Based on the 2020-2022 Reclamation Guarantee document  approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,  opening area in 2020 is limited to an area of 410.24 hectares,  consisting of 323.52 hectares new openings and 77.72 hectares  re-disturbed area openings.
In 2020, the mining areas covered  an area of 281,4 hectares.
The total tons of nickel ore material mined in 2020 reached  13.5 million tons ROM or equals 4.2 million tons DKP .
It was an  8% increase compared to 2019 total of 12.5 million tons ROM,  or 4.3 million tons DKP .
This was due to the adjustment made  to the amount of feed required by the process plant due to the  delay of furnace 4 maintenance related to COVID-19.
The Company continues its efforts to find nickel ore reserves  through exploration activities and pre-feasibility studies to  ensure the sustainability of its mining operations.
At the end  of 2020, total nickel ore reserves stood at 104,0 million tons of  dry kiln product (“DKP”), 3.4% lower than the 2019 reserves of  107.6 million tons.
This decrease was due to mining activities  to fill the process plant feed requirements.
Nickel In Matte Production Segment The nickel in matte production process uses screening  station product (“SSP”) obtained from the mining operations.
The production process takes place at the processing and  production facility in Sorowako, starting with the drying  process in the drying kiln to reduce moisture content to 20%.
After the drying process, nickel ore goes into dry ore storage  (“DOS”), and is then processed in a reduction kiln to remove  all moisture content.
The process continues in the calcination  zone, to convert the nickel oxide into nickel metal.
At this  stage, other materials such as coal and sulfur are fed into the  reduction kiln.
The final product of rthe reduction kiln process  is calcine, which has a temperature of around 700 degrees  celsius.
The calcine is then fed into an electric furnace for  smelting and reduction processes to produce furnace matte.
In the electric furnace, only about 7% of the total nickel ore  input comes out as furnace matte, with the rest being slag.
Electric furnaces requires temperatures up to about 1,500  degrees celsius to separate slag and produce furnace matte.
Electricity supplies come from our self-owned hydroelectric  power plants (“HEPP”), with a thermal power plant as a backup.
The Company owns three HEPP units: Larona, Balambano and  Karebbe with a total capacity of 365 MegaWatts.
From the electric furnace, the furnace matte is transported to  converters to remove the iron.
The liquid converter matte is  poured into high pressure water streams to produce dense  granules with a diameter of about 0.3 mm, called nickel matte.
After that, the nickel matte is dried and packed.
Packed nickel  matte must meet the required specifications before being  transported to Balantang port for shipment to the buyers in  Japan.
The total production of nickel in matte in 2020 reached 72,237  tons, 2% higher than the 71,025 tons produced in 2019.
Nickel Matte Sales Segment The Company’s nickel matte sales are conducted through  long-term agreements with VCL and SMM.
Based on these  agreements, PT Vale sells 80% of its annual products to VCL  and the remaining 20% to SMM.
Sales are denominated in US$  based on the LME price formula.
Nickel matte is sent to VCL  and SMM by ship.
Nickel matte sales in 2020 reached 72,846 tons, with the  highest sales volume in Q3/2020 with 19,954 tons.
Nickel  matte sales in 2020 increased by 1% compared to 72,044 tons  in 2019.
This was due to higher production in 2020.
Secara umum, kegiatan usaha Perseroan pada tahun 2020  dipengaruhi beberapa faktor:Profitability The Company’s financial performance (sales/revenue and  profitability) is not presented by business segment, but on a  consolidated basis.
Revenue grew only after the first quarter of 2020, and this had  an impact on the Company’s overall financial performance.
At  the end of the 2020 fiscal year, PT Vale recorded an operating  profit of US$103.8  million, an increase of 18% compared to  US$89.5 million in 2019.
The unit cash cost of revenue in 2020 was US$6,675 per ton, a  decrease of 10% compared to US$7,403 per ton in 2019.
This  was due to lower fuel and coal prices.
The COVID-19 pandemic forced the Company to exercise  prudent control over spending, to maintain cash availability,  and to remain focused on savings initiatives.
This occurred at  the same time as nickel prices fell following a decline in nickel  demand, and the disruption to the world economy due to the  COVID-19 pandemic.
This management discussion and analysis of the financial  condition and operational results must be read in conjunction  with the Company’s Financial Statements as of December 31,  2020, which are attached at the end of this Annual Report.

Realisasi belanja modal pada tahun 2020 tercatat lebih rendah 3% dibanding realisasi tahun 2019 sebesar AS$166,4 jutaThe Company’s performance in 2020 produced quite good  results, given the conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic  that affected both national and global economic conditions.
The positive performance in 2020 and the increased nickel  in matte production realization are separate issues, and both  were impacted by the postponement in rebuilding electric  furnace 4 to Q2/2021.
The improvement in average nickel  prices throughout the reporting period helped improve the  Company’s operating revenue realization.
Meanwhile, the  divestment of 20% of the Company’s shares to PT Indonesia  Asahan Aluminum (Persero) or “Inalum” , strengthened the  long-term strategic partnerships for managing mineral  resources in Indonesia.
Nickel In Matte Production The Company revised its production target for 2020 from  71,000 tons to 73,000, due to the delay in the furnace 4 rebuild.
The nickel in matte production realization reached 72,237  tons, or 2% lower than target, however, 2% higher than the  71,025 tons production in 2019.
Nickel Matte Sales The nickel matte sales target in 2020 was 73,000 tons, with  realization reaching 72,846 tons, or similar with the target.
The  2020 sales were 1% higher compared to 72,044 tons in 2019.
Revenue The Company’s revenue target for 2020 was US$850.1 million,  with realization reaching US$764.7 million, or 11% lower  than the target.
Revenue in 2020 was 2% lower compared to  US$782.0 million in 2019.
Capital Expenditure For 2020, the Company planned capital expenditure of US$180  million, and realization reached US$160.6 million, or 89.2% of the target.
This amount was 3% lower compared to US$166.4 million in 2019.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company postponed  its plan to rebuild furnace 4 from Q4/2020 to Q2/2021.
The  rebuild is estimated to take five months, so the delay will have  an impact on production in 2021  The decision to delay the rebuild to Q2/2021 is based on  predictions of continued improvement in nickel prices on  world markets.
Any improvements in world nickel prices  will help the Company’s performance even though nickel  production will be lower.
Nickel in Matte Production Target The Company’s 2021 target for nickel in matte production is  64,083 tons.
This amount is lower by 11% than the nickel in  matte production in 2020 of 72,237  tons.
Nickel Matte Sales Target The 2021 target for nickel matte sales is 64,780 tons.
This  amount is lower by 11% from the nickel matte sales in 2020  of 72,846 tons. 2020 Annual Report 151 Target Pendapatan  Target perolehan Pendapatan tahun 2021 sebesar AS$683,3  juta.
Revenue Target The 2021 target for revenue is US$683.3 million.
This amount  is lower by 11% than the 2020 revenue of US$764.7 million.
Capital Expenditures Target In 2021, the Company’s planned capital expenditures will  be approximately US$195 million, and will be used for  sustaining and expansion capital expenditures.
The sustaining  expenditures will be focused on the total rebuild of electric  furnace 4, which will begin in the Q2/2021.
The construction  process will last for five months and is targeted for completion  in November 2021.
Capital expenditures will be focused on continuing mine  development, replacing heavy equipment and increasing  the capacity of the nickel in matte processing plants.
The  Company has also budgeted costs related to the Pomalaa  and Bahodopi development projects together with progress  studies, licensing and negotiation processes with selected  partners.
PT Vale terus mendorong ekspansi usaha dengan  pembangunan tiga fasilitas pengolahan dan pemurnian The Company’s assessment of its business prospects and  business continuity is carried out using assumptions that  are considered relevant to the industry and the global and  national conditions.
Nickel is a much sought after industrial  metal, especially for the stainless steel industry.
A number of publications have stated that global stainless  steel production will continue to increase by up to 16% by  2025, meaning that world nickel demand will continue to  grow.
The need for nickel in other industries, according to  Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consulting institute,  indicates growth potential of around 5% per year, from around  750 kilo tons in 2019 to 980 kilo tons in 2025 and 2.11 million  tons in 2040.
The strong growth is driven by a forecast for nickel  in Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage  (ES).
Over this period, the share of global nickel demand for  EV/ES is expected to increase from 4% in 2018 to 31% in 2040.
Even though it was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and  experienced a decline in Q1/2020, global nickel demand and  prices began to rise again at the beginning of Q2/2020 .
This  was triggered by an economic recovery in China at the end of  their lockdown period.
The increase in nickel demand was also  the result of resumed infrastructure projects and technological  developments in China, especially for electric cars, which were  previously delayed and stopped.
The growing demand for nickel on the world market presents  an opportunity for the Company to develop its business.
PT  Vale will continue its business expansion by constructing  three processing and refining facilities (smelters) in Sorowako,  2020 Annual Report 153 (smelter)  di Sorowako, Bahodopi dan Pomalaa.
For Sorowako, the development plan  is mandated by the CoW amendment to increase production  by up to 25%.
To achieve this, investment will be made  in continuous improvements and the construction of an  additional RKEF production line with an additional production  level of around 10,000 tons.
With this continuous improvement  project and additional production line, it is hoped that the  nickel production target of 90,000 tons can be achieved before  the end of the CoW.
The Company is also continuing its development plans for  the Bahodopi Block, Central Sulawesi, and the Pomalaa Block,  Southeast Sulawesi.
By the end of this reporting period, the  development of these two blocks has entered the feasibility  study stage involving finalizing negotiations with potential  strategic partners, namely a nickel processing company from  China for the Bahodopi Block, and SMM for the Pomalaa   Block.
The next step will be to gain approval for the expansion  projects in Bahodopi and Pomalaa, obtain the necessary  permits and commence the funding process for these two  projects.
The Company’s future business prospects are also dependent  upon the volatility of nickel prices on the world market, as  well as the ability to control factors that affect production  costs, including fuel consumption.
The Company follows a risk  control approach to reduce potential losses due to volatility  in nickel and fuel prices.
At the same time, the Company also  follows efficiency programs to reduce production costs to the  lowest possible level, so that it remains competitive regardless  of world nickel price movements.
The fuel cost has reached up   30% of production costs in recent years.
