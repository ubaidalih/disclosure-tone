Economic   Review Global Economic Analysis The Covid-19 pandemic caused the  world to fall into an economic recession, recording growth of -3.0% in 2020.
The discovery of the Covid-19 vaccine in early 2021 greatly helped the global economic recovery in 2021.
Economic activity in general gradually revived, and the wheels of the economy tended to return to normal.
The global economy was recovering and recording expansive growth in 2021 of 6.0%.
If depicted graphically, the global economic recovery until 2021 moves like the letter “V” and is known as the V-Shape Recovery (Figure 1).

Global Economic Growth Rate 2010-2022F 2.86.0 3.4 (3.0) Description : *2022F = IMF projections for October 2022 Source : World Economic Outlook Report, International Monetery Fund (IMF), October 2022 The recovery of the world economy in 2021 continued in 2022.
Unfortunately, the pace of economic recovery was hampered due to increasing challenges and high economic and geopolitical uncertainties.
Throughout 2022, there were at least two main problems that impeded the trend of global economic recovery, namely: (1) The outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war which prompted an increase in global economic risks and increases in commodity prices and (2) Very high global inflationary pressures thereby encouraging various central banks to aggressively raise their benchmark interest rates throughout 2022.
Combination of these problems had the potential to trigger the global economy to fall into the abyss of “stagflation”, namely a condition in which economic growth tended to stagnate and even tends to fall, followed by high inflation rates.
Global economic pressure in 2022, started in early 2022, became a result of high geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have occurred since 2021 and continued into war in February 2022 with the Russian military invasion of Ukrainian territory since February 24, 2022.
The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war caused supply chain disruptions to increase again, reflected in the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (Global Supply Chain Pressure Index- GSCPI) which increased significantly (Figure 2).
In addition, the Russia-Ukraine war also led to increased risks on the supply side, especially energy and food commodities, considering that the two countries became the main producers and distributors of energy and food commodities in the world, such as oil and wheat.
The war that occurred in these two countries caused the production of energy and food commodities to be disrupted, so that the supply of commodities in the global market became relatively limited.

Entering the end of 2021, supply chain disruptions were gradually recovering in line with increasing global vaccination rates and pushing back economic activities of the global community so that global commodity prices are gradually decreasing.
However, increased supply chain disruption and supply risk in energy and food commodities due to Russia-Ukraine tensions pushed up the prices of these various commodities (Figure 3).
After Russia carried out its military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, commodity prices again crept up and were even higher than the average price in 2021.
Global Commodity Price Index Movement (2 Jan 2019 = 100) Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, January 2023, Processed data Rising commodity prices had an impact on global production activities, considering that commodities became one of the strategic inputs in the world economy.
An increase in commodity prices pushed up production costs, which then lead to rising prices for consumer goods and eventually caused the inflation rate to rise significantly in 2022 (Figure 4), far above  normal conditions (2019).

This was in contrast to the previous conditions in which the benchmark interest rates of various central banks in the world were at a fairly low level in the context of economic recovery due to the pandemic.
Figure 5 shows the magnitude of changes in the benchmark interest rate at various central banks in the world, both in developed and developing countries.
The US central bank (The Fed) raised its benchmark interest rate aggressively in order to reduce high inflationary pressures in the US where the highest inflation rate reached 9.1% YoY in June 2022.
Throughout 2022, the Fed was recorded as having raised its interest rates seven times or around 425bps, namely 25bps at the FOMC March 2022, 50bps at the FOMC May 2022 and December 2022, and 75bps at the FOMC June 2022, July 2022, September 2022 and November 2022.
With these increases, the Fed Funds Rate was 4.25- 4.50% at the end of 2022 from 0.00-0.25% at the beginning of 2022.
Apart from The Fed, the European Union central bank (ECB) also raised its benchmark interest rate by 250bps throughout 2022 to reduce high inflationary pressures .

Movement of Global Economic Activity Growth Indicators (% YoY) Source: OECD Economic Outlook, OECD, November 2022 The US economy throughout 2022 experienced challenges and  tended to experience a slowing growth trend.
The US economy was the highest YoY in Q1’22 with a growth of 3.7% YoY and continued to show slow growth with growth in Q2’22, Q3’22 and Q4’22 were respectively 1.8%, 1.9% and 1%.
The US economic slowdown was reflected from the decline in various indicators of production and sales, as well as pessimistic consumer sentiment due to high inflationary pressures in the US.
The high inflation rate in the US also pushed the US central bank (The Fed) to implement a tight monetary policy by increasing interest rates.
Throughout 2022, the Fed will increase interest rates seven times, namely 25 bps in March, 50 bps in May and December and 75 bps in June, July, September and November so that in total the Fed raised interest rates throughout 2022 by 425bps.
The tight monetary policy implemented by the Fed started to have an impact on the US inflation rate.
The US inflation rate started to show a slower trend with Dec’22 inflation of 6.5% YoY lower than its Jun’22 peak of 9.1%, but still far away higher than the Fed’s target of around the 2% level.
Taking this into account, BRI estimated that the US benchmark interest rate still increased to around 25-50bps in 2023.
From the financial sector, global financial conditions experienced  tighter movements in 2022 compared to 2021.
Figure 7 shows the index of financial conditions in several countries which tended to increase throughout 2022.
This was driven by an aggressive increase in benchmark interest rates by various central banks around the world throughout 2022.
Aggressive monetary normalization led to increased volatility in world stock and bond markets, thereby increasing the risk on financial instruments.

In January 2023, the IMF made a downward revision of the projected global economic growth in 2022 to 3.4%, lower than the projected 4.4% in January 2022.
Similar to the IMF, the World Bank also made significant downward revisions to global economic growth in 2022 from 4.1% in January 2022 to 2.9% in the projected January 2023.
The challenges in 2022 were expected to still have an impact on the pace of global economic growth in 2023.
Global economic uncertainty was expected to remain quite high due to the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic had not ended; the Russia-Ukraine war ha not ended; the global inflation rate was still high (in above pre-pandemic levels), and the threat of a global economic recession due to the high probability of a recession in various countries in the world, especially the US and the European Union.
In October 2022, the IMF estimated that at least 1/3 of global GDP contributors would fall into recession in 2023.
Various international institutions, including the IMF, predicted that global economic growth in 2023 will be relatively slower compared to 2022 (Table 1).

Figure 9 shows the trend of national economic growth until 2022.
Even though in the fourth quarter of 2022 the national economic growth experienced a slowdown, full year economic performance in 2022 increased compared to 2021.
Indonesia’s economic growth in 2022 was recorded to have grown by 5.31 %, better than in 2021 which grew by 3.70%.
National economic growth increased in 2022 driven by higher growth in public consumption and investment in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Public consumption in 2022 was recorded to grow by 4.93%, better than in 2021 which grew by 2.02%.
In line with that, national investment also recorded better growth, where in 2022 it grew by 3.87% compared to 3.80% in the previous year.
Accelerating the increase in public consumption and national investment in 2022 was driven by an increase in community economic activity in line with the easing of restrictions on community activities.
This was a proof that the control of Covid-19 in went well.
In addition, the national vaccination rate also continued to show an increase, in the first, second and booster vaccines.
The rate of vaccination that continued to increase is of course the main key in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 207 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.207 2022   Annual Report Apart from being supported by a strong domestic performance,  Indonesia’s accelerated economic growth in 2022 was also supported by a fairly strong external trade performance.
In full year, although it was slightly lower than the 2021 growth of 17.95%, national export growth in 2022 was able to grow 16.28% amidst conditions of global uncertainty.
Export growth performance, which was still double digit, was supported by commodity prices which moved to increase throughout 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
The strong external trade performance was reflected in the Indonesian Trade Balance (NPI), which continued to record a surplus until the end of 2022.
In December 2022, the BOP recorded a surplus of US$3.96 billion.
The surplus in the BOP was supported by the high value of national exports, especially on non-oil and gas exports based on energy and minerals.
In addition, the BOP surplus was also driven by import growth which contracted in December 2022 by -7.0% YoY due to a decrease in growth in imports of consumer goods by -27.5% YoY.
Throughout 2022, the balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$54.53 billion, much higher than in 2021 which was US$35.42 billion.

In addition to the increase in commodity prices, the increase in inflation in 2022 was also driven by the increase in the price of subsidized fuel oil in September 2022.
Although the increase in subsidized fuel had an impact on increasing annual inflation, the synergy of the right government policies was able to reduce this increase, and this could be seen from the downward trend in inflation since the increase in subsidized fuel, where inflation in December 22 was 5.51% lower than Sep’22 inflation of 5.95%.
Taking into account the current conditions, stability was expected to be maintained and inflation was expected to return to Bank Indonesia’s target of 3 ± 1%. 6.0 5.04.03.02.01.00.0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov DecFigure 10.

High inflation in this group of goods was driven by an increase in fuel prices by the government in September 3, 2022.
In addition, administered price inflation also recorded quite high at 13.34% YoY, much higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 which was 1.79% YoY.
The core inflation rate also showed an increase where in Quarter-IV 2022 it reached to 3.36% YoY from 1.56% YoY in Quarter-IV 2021.
In addition, inflation in the volatile price group also experienced an increase in 2022 compared to 2021, where in the fourth quarter of 2022 it was recorded at 5.61% YoY, raising up from 3.20% YoY in the same quarter in 2021.

This caused the flow of foreign capital in Indonesian financial market to move outward, especially the bond market.
At the end in 2022, the Rupiah was closed at the level of IDR15,568 per US Dollar, or had been depreciated by 9.23% compared to the value of the Rupiah at the end of 2021.
Looking ahead in 2023, it was estimated that the rupiah will still be quite under pressure at the average value in the range of IDR15,100 to IDR15,400 per USD.
However, the movement of the Rupiah from the beginning of 2023 to the end 2023 was expected to move stronger though the value was still above IDR15,000 per USD.
Current Global uncertainty caused by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the rise The Fed’s aggressive benchmark rate became the offset of gradually recovering of the domestic economy, the lower foreign ownership of Government Securities of Indonesia, and the high commodity prices still encouraged improving balance of payments and strengthening national foreign exchange reserves.
On the national banking side, industry performance until  September 2022 persistently still showed expansive performance.
Bank loans continued to record growth in strong and positive value with an increasing trend since June 2021.
In September 2022 loan growth was recorded at by 11.0% YoY, an increase compared to the position in August 2022 by 10.6% YoY.
Loan growth was still expansive in September 2022 supported by all types of good loan on investment loans, working capital, and consumption, as well as on most sectors of the economy.
Expansive performance at Loan growth was also followed by constantly stable loan quality, as seen from the value of gross non-performing Loan (NPL) which slightly improved to 2.78% in September 2022 from 2.88% from August 2022.
However, liquidity of the banking industry continued to show a downward trend.
This can be seen from the growth of TPF which still declined to 6.8% YoY in September 2022 from 7.8% YoY in August 2022.
Entering 2023, Indonesia’s economic recovery was estimated to  continue even though accompanied by various challenges such as uncertainty over the end of the pandemic (resurgence of increase cases of Covid-19 in China), the unresolved Russia-Ukraine conflict, global inflationary pressures which were still relatively higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the threat of a global recession particularly developed countries such as the United States and the European Union.

In line with the optimism towards domestic economic conditions and positive sentiment over the moderately controlled Covid-19 pandemic, Consumer Confidence Index still showed expansive consumer perceptions.
In addition, the performance of the banking industry in Indonesia was still well maintained.
Based on FSA data as of September 2022, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was at the level of 25.09%, increasing 0.43% compared to the previous quarter, but fell by around 0.09% compared to Quarter III 2021.
The banking industry also had adequate liquidity in Quarter III 2022, as indicated by Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 82.05% or an increase of 3.12% compared to the previous third quarter of 2021.
In September 2022, the total assets of the national banking industry  was IDR10,487 trillion or an increase of 7.73% YoY.
The same trend could be seen in the growth of commercial bank lending 10.98% YoY to IDR6,274 trillion.
It showed the strengthening of demand for loan in line with the decline in Covid-19 cases in Indonesia.
Amidst increasing external risks, well-managed credit risk in the banking industry as well as financing supported by solid liquidity and strong capital.
Loan quality was still maintained with Non Performing Loan (NPL) in September 2022 reaching 2.78%, far improved compared to September 2021 of 3.22%.
Loan Quality was still below the maximum level of 5% set by the regulator.
In addition to Third Party Funds also experienced positive growth of 6.77% YoY to IDR7,647 trillion.
In terms of profitability, the national banking industry noted ROA  profitability which showed an increase.
ROA Banking Industry in September 2022 was 2.51% better compared to September 2021 which was only 1.91% and December 2021 of 1.84%.
The net profit in September 2022 reached IDR154,457 billion or a significant increase of 47.64% compared to September 2021.
was expected to minimize the impact of the turmoil external to the national economy as a whole.
The acceleration of national economic recovery in the future will also be significant depending on government policies in maintaining society’s purchasing power in the midst of high inflationary pressure (above the level of pre-pandemic).

This increase was mainly due to the Micro KUR growth of 32.18%.
The increase in Micro KUR was due to the allocation of the Micro KUR quota breakdown in 2022 of IDR227.4 trillion.
This is in line with the growth of loan debtors by 7.83% from 13.31 million people in 2021 to 14.35 million people in 2022.
Micro Business Strategies In 2022 84.7% of BRI’s loans were dominated by the MSME segment; MSME segments had a major role in supporting national economic growth.
Therefore, in line with BRI’s core competence in the micro business and also as an agent of development, BRI remained committed to empowering and developing business in this segment.
Even though the economy started to show a stretch of recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, BRI still faced pressure, especially in the expansion of the micro segment commercial loan business.
The challenges currently being faced included the trend of decreasing interest rates and improving loans quality, especially cloans restructuring due to Covid-19.
These challenges required the Company’s agility to maintain micro business values as a core business which played an important role for the Company’s sustainability.
Taking this into account, BRI’s micro business strategy was directed  at the principle of go smaller, go shorter, go faster.
The formation of an ultra-micro holding was one of BRI’s strategies to enter into a smaller segment (ultra-micro) and capture the potential of the ultra-micro segment through harmonious synergy with ultra-micro control of Pegadaian and PMN.
This synergy was utilized optimally for the Company to create new sources of income as new drivers for the Company’s business growth (new growth engine).
Apart from aiming to strengthen new sources of growth, ultra  micro holdings also contributed to achieving financial inclusion aspirations.
Ultra micro holding provided broader and easier access to financial services to the ultra micro segment in Indonesia.
With this synergy, the BRI, Pegadaian and PNM business models that complemented each other was able to provide an integrated financial service journey for the sustainability of ultra-micro  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 221 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.221 2022   Annual Report business empowerment.
These complementary business models  could provide added value in providing integrated financial products and services in one ecosystem.
BRI’s micro business development was focused on increasing the  Company’s capabilities to create stronger micro business values by taking several strategic steps as follows:1.
Rejuvenation of conventional products (loans and savings) by utilizing technology in the form of micro digital lending and micropayments, especially to target the ultra micro segment. 2.
Efficiency of business processes through revitalization of paramedics (marketers), enhancement of BRISpot Micro, as well as updating the end-to-end operating model of marketers, which had an impact on increasing the productivity of paramedics. 3.
Maintaining productive asset quality through optimizing restructuring success rates, monitoring Super Micro and Micro KUR distribution, monitoring micro business performance, and using data analytics to strengthen the credit underwriting process. 4.
Improving micro and ultra micro ecosystem propositions by developing hyperlocal ecosystems with a focus on village ecosystems, markets, groups of business actors and certain commodities. 5.
Developing partnership business models by utilizing BRILink Agents and UMi partners to market appropriate financial products and services. 6.
Playing an active role in assisting the Government in increasing the capacity and capability of Indonesian micro-enterprises through financial literacy, social-economic empowerment, digital penetration, and distribution of Government programs.
Competitive Advantage and Micro Business InnovationThe improvements of Micro Business Loan and Third Party Funds during 2022 was attributable to the various innovations that BRI executed, such as: 1.
Commodity Platform  BRI in collaboration with third parties provided solutions for  commodity-based ecosystem players to more easily access BRI services that were digitally integrated through a commodity platform called the Indonesian People’s Market (PARI).
In 2022 BRI focused on the ecosystems of eggs, corn, shallots, fish, coffee and milk with a total acquisition of 39,211 users, with a total of 215,726 transactions, a bailout fund of IDR2.05 trillion and a gross merchandise value of IDR8.09 trillion with a number of farmers 14,729 breeders and 8,436 collectors. 2.
BRI Codification Business System (BRIKODES)  In line with the aspirations of BRIvolution 2.0, namely “Champion of Financial Inclusion”, BRI further strengthened its commitment to extending the reach of financial services to all levels of society.
This spirit of financial inclusion also showed that BRI as a bank with the largest customer base in Indonesia was proactive in supporting the realization of the national financial inclusion strategic achievement of 90% in 2024.
To realize BRI’s aspirations to become a Champion of Financial Inclusion, it needed to be supported by providing a database based on data analytics so that it could provide comprehensive information.
With this information, it was able to produce an impactful strategy that was beneficial for BRI’s business performance with an innovative data management platform called “BRIKODES (BRI Kodifikasi Business System)”. 3.
Pojok Mantri Desa  Pojok Mantri Desa became a movement program to acquire micro business potential in a sustainable manner by establishing “Pojok Mantri BRI” at Village offices in BRI Unit work areas throughout Indonesia with the aim of supporting marketers or paramedics in carrying out mastery of micro business ecosystems (markets, villages/ clusters and payments) in accordance with the work area and performs its function as a financial advisor and captures potential business flows in the village in accordance with micro targets such as the acquisition of a community of business actors/MSMEs in the village, a community of market traders, a leading business cluster and a community other potential villages for micro business sustainability and facilitating the search for micro customer pipelines. 4.
Senyum Mobile  Holding UMi aimed to combine key entities that can better develop the ultra-micro segment.
The ultra-micro ecosystem will help the journey to increase the class of society from the ultra-micro segment to the micro-segment.
The ultra micro ecosystem played an important role in enhancing the landscape of the ultra micro segment in Indonesia.
Therefore BRI created the Senyum Mobile application as an integrated digital sales platform used by marketers to carry out cross-entity product marketing (BRI, PNM and Pegadaian). 5.
KECEKU (Auto Supplement Feature)  In an effort to efficiency and accelerate micro loans, BRI’s Micro Business innovated by creating an automatic supplement feature for existing Kupedes debtors.
This feature made it easy and saved time for Credit Analysts and Debtors when applying for Kupedes loan supplementation to return to the initial limit in which the selected debtors could submit a supplementation process via the debtor’s own cellphone after receiving WhatsApp Blast from BRI Info without the need to come to the BRI Unit office.
KECE 2.0  Ultra micro segment loan designed within the concept “go  lower, go shorter, go faster” through convenience and speed.
KECE 2.0 Loan became a further development from the marketed KECE 1.0 loan by referral through UMi Partners.
The form of development in the KECE 2.0 loan was a process loan application services through the BRISPOT UMi Partners application.
In the KECE 2.0 service process, UMi Partners became the extension of the credit analysts’ hand who could initiate loans, but it was still verified by BRI (Credit Analysts of BRI).
KECE Kupedes Loans could encourage performance and growth of Kupedes in BRI Unit through potential Ultra Micro customers.
Support To Government Programs The Micro Business is also the form of supports for government programs in promoting financial literacy, financial inclusion or the economic empowerment of communities in the Disadvantaged, Frontier, and Outermost regions (3T).
To increase financial literacy and inclusion, BRI Micro Business  has marketed its Basic Saving Account (BSA) products, namely Tabunganku and SimPel (Student Saving) to the public.
During the pandemic, micro businesses were also fully committed as an effort to recover the national economy by becoming the main partner of the Government in the National Economic Recovery Program (PEN), including:1.
Conducting loan restructuring to protect loan affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. 2.
Distributing Loan Interest Subsidy 3.
Distributing Super Micro People’s Business Loan (KUR) Business Prospects and Micro Business Strategy in 2023Micro business had long been a core competency for BRI.
With the support of an extensive network of offices and competent marketers, BRI reached and served the financial service needs of micro businesses throughout the country.
A very large customer base became an opportunity as well as a challenge for BRI to be able to optimize it to accelerate micro business growth going forward.
However, change occured quickly and was inevitable.
The ongoing  pandemic encouraged widespread adoption of technology to the point that it affected people’s behavior, including changing the patterns of transactions and business of micro-entrepreneurs.
Widespread adoption of technology provided options for business actors and micro communities in general to enjoy borderless financial services and access to non-conventional commercial financing.
Such conditions changed the map of micro business competition in the future, especially with non-banking entities that provided financial technology services (P2P lending, Paylater, Business Bailout Funds, and so on).
Therefore, the future development of BRI’s micro business will be  carried out with a beyond banking perspective through product innovation as well as a sustainable business process and business model.
Synergies between BRI, Pegadaian and PNM were carried out in harmony to create new sources of income as new drivers for the Company’s business growth (new growth engines).
In the next three years (2023-2025), BRI’s Micro business will focus  on improving the quality of business processes in operational lines, growth and quality of commercial loans as well as developing products and business models to create new sources of income.
In line with that, the development in one year (2023) is pursued through several strategic steps as follows:1.
Rejuvenation of products by developing products based on turn over (loans with short tenors); 2.
Improving the quality of business processes through improving the Credit analysts revitalization policy as well as the positions of Assistant Micro Business Manager (AMBM) and Micro Business Manager (MBM), adopting digital signature technology in loan documents, and implementing hyper personalization as data analytics for ultra micro customers regarding deposit products as well as the right loan to offer according to the risk assessment and level of literacy; 3.
Creating a new business model through the Credit Analyst Agents scheme as part of efforts to develop the UMi Agent partnership business, business expansion (scope up) the Pasar Rakyat Indonesia/PARI and Senyum Mobile applications, acquisition of CASA based on micropayment ecosystems, and empowerment of business actors collectively (Business Cluster, Group, Community Meetings (Arisan)); 4.
Improving the capabilities of Credit analysts with a fit education and developing reliable supporting tools to strengthen their social role as digital extension workers as well as financial advisors for micro-entrepreneurs.

PT Danareksa Investment Management Business Prospect  and Strategy in 20232022 ended with various global sentiments driving financial markets.
Throughout 2022, corporate bond-based fixed income mutual funds became the choice of investors amid high economic uncertainty and the implementation of a tight monetary policy.
The increase in the Bank Indonesia (BI) 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (7D-RRR) interest rate significantly caused an increase in banking deposit rates and the issuance of Retail Sukuk and ORI instruments which had the character of instruments with minimal price fluctuations and coupons increased along with the increase in BI 7D -RRR, causing a shift in investment to the two instruments.
In addition, the high loan growth and increase in Statutory Reserves caused the need for banking liquidity to increase which resulted in reduced investor attractiveness for Money Market RD.
In RDT, AUM fell because the protected RD industry no longer has tax incentives.
Currently, the tax rate on bonds was the same for both mutual funds and non-mutual funds.
In response to ongoing macroeconomic developments, in 2023 there will be several investment opportunities that investors can optimize by paying attention to 2 significant things, namely the potential for a global economic slowdown and the potential for the end of monetary policy tightening.
The increase in interest rates in developed countries such as the United States and Europe is projected to drive an economic slowdown.
On the other hand, if inflation eases and policy interest rates start to ease, there will be positive sentiment for riskier assets.
Moving on from this, we are of the view that during the first  quarter, with US interest rates as well as Bank Indonesia’s BI 7D-RRR expected to continue to increase, money market mutual funds are still attractive to investors with a conservative risk profile.
For long-term investors who have a risk profile suitable for stocks, equity mutual funds can be considered for accumulation as there has been a correction for the JCI since December 2022 where the JCI is now in an attractive valuation.
Entering the end of Quarter II, with expectations of risk and global  inflation falling, fixed income mutual funds have the potential to perform attractively because the bond market will benefit from the potential reduction in US and BI 7D-RRR interest rates in semester II 2023.
In an effort to diversify for all profiles risk, money market mutual funds will still be a good counterweight, including providing liquidity in investors’ portfolios.
Revenue and Profitability of Operating  Segments  In line with the start of economic recovery due to the impact  the Covid-19 pandemic, this recovery can also be shown in the increasingly solid BRI performance growth.

During 2022, in the midst of global economic  uncertainty and the trend of global economic recovery which is still slowing down, with the support of adequate planning and monitoring, BRI is able to record good financial performance with a maintained level of bank soundness.
This condition is reflected in the achievement of the company’s financial targets, such as profit, PPOP (nominal and growth YoY), ROE, CAR and other important metrics.
As a Holding Company, BRI optimally manages 10  (ten) owned subsidiaries, which can be seen from the growth of BRI’s profit and fee-based income contribution in 2022 of 131.58% YoY.
The BRI Group’s proud performance above sent a  positive signal to the market so that by the end of 2022, BRI’s market capitalization reached IDR748.7 trillion, growing by 60.19% YoY.
The achievement of all of BRI’s targets above is inseparable from the implementation of good budgeting and performance management processes and governance, including the establishment of Key Performance Indicators.
The reliability of financial reports that continues to be improved is demonstrated by the maintenance of Standard ISO 9001: 2015 certification in Audit Surveillance for Design of Accounting Policy and Accounting Control, Preparation and Verification of Published Financial, Statements, Budget Planning and Control, and Corporate Financial Tax Compliance.
In addition, a more granular profitability assessment  down to the product level has made each element at BRI more focused on achieving performance.
Organizational effectiveness which is one of the duties and responsibilities of the Directorate of Finance, in 2022 also shows an improved score compared to 2021.
To improve the quality of the Directorate of Finance  in carrying out its role, internal strategic initiatives have also been implemented in 2022 that focus on strengthening digital capabilities to drive efficiency of internal business processes.
Some of these initiatives include the implementation of several SAP New Finance System modules (FAM, BGP, IEM, FSL, and others).

Prime lending calculation does not take into account the risk  premium component of the debtor, whose amount depends on the assessment of the risk of each debtor.
As such, the amount of loan interest charged to debtors is not necessarily the same as the prime lending rate.
The prime lending rate calculation applies to corporate loans, retail loans, micro loans, and consumer loans (mortgages and non-mortgages).
In non-mortgages of consumer loans does not include the distribution of funds through Credit Cards and Unsecured Loan.
However, Bank Indonesia submitted the loan classification according to the bank’s internal criteria.

Repossessed assets  62,732  63,922  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 311 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.311 2022   Annual Report Strategy for Improving Fee Based Income  During 2022, BRI was able to record fee-based income and other  income (bank only) of IDR38.42 trillion or grew 18.69% YoY.
This income came from fee-based income of IDR18.47 trillion or grew 11.61% YoY, Income from Treasury transactions reached IDR2.47 trillion or grew -49.43% YoY, Income recovery on earning assets that had been written off reached IDR11.86 trillion or grew 32.96% year on year, and other income reached IDR5.62 trillion or grew 179.54% YoY.
In 2022, the largest increase in BRI’s fee-based income was obtained from e-channel and e-banking transactions, loan services, deposit services, and trade finance services.
BRI continued to increase fee-based income by focusing on increasing e-channel and e-banking transactions in each segment, starting from the ultra micro to wholesale segments by providing various services and services according to the characteristics of these segments supported by its digital initiatives so that made it easier for each customer to make transactions such as BRIMO, digital savings, cash management system and branchless banking/BRILink agency business.
Besides that, the increase in fee-based income was carried out through cross selling by collaborating with Subsidiaries.
Capital Structure  Management Policy for Capital Structure and  Basic Management Policy Selection of Capital Structure  Capital structure management is intended to ensure that BRI  consistently has adequate capital level to set off inherent risks in its business without compromising the value provided to its shareholders As of December 2022, BRI has a CAR of 23.30% (bank only) and  25.54% (consolidated).
Financial Services Authority Regulation No.34/POJK.03/2016 and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 15/12/PBI/2013 concerning the Minimum Capital Requirement for Commercial Banks, states that a level 2 (satisfactory) risk profile has a minimum CAR of 9% to less than 10%.
Apart from the minimum CAR provisions, as part of the implementation of Basel 3, BRI is required to form additional capital as a buffer in accordance with which consists of:1.
Capital Conservation Buffer at 2,50% of the Risk- Weighted Assets (RWA). 2.
Countercyclical Buffer at 0,00% of RWA. 3.
Capital Surcharge for Systematic Banks at 2,50% of RWA.
BRI’s total minimum CAR is at the level of 14.46%, so BRI’s CAR in 2022 of 23.30% (bank only) and 25.54% (consolidated) has met the provisions of the banking and financial services regulator.
In terms of capital structure, as of December 2022, BRI has core  capital (Tier-1) of IDR234.73 trillion (bank only) and IDR273.81 trillion (consolidated) and Supplementary Capital (Tier-2) of IDR10.56 trillion (bank only) and IDR11.27 trillion (consolidated) with a Tier-1 CAR ratio of 22.30% (bank only) and 24.53% (consolidated).
BRI Tier-1 consists of CET-1 because BRI’s main source of capital is retained earnings.

PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 343 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.343 2022   Annual Report Disclosure of Counterparty Credit Risk  Exposure (Counterparty Credit Risk) Counterparty credit risk could occur due to derivative, repo and  reverse repo transactions.
In accordance with the condition of the Indonesian financial market which did not have many derivative instruments, Bank BRI had a derivative exposure that was not too significant.
Based on the standard reporting approach, counterparty credit risk exposure was as follows.
Definition-  Replacement Cost (RC): For trades related to margining requirements, RC was the loss incurred if a counterparty defaulted and would be issued if the transaction was made immediately.
For margined trades, the loss that would incur if the counterparty defaulted now or in the future, assumes that expenses and switching transactions would occur instantly.
However, spending a trade on a default counterparty could not be done instantly.
The RC under the Current Exposure Method was described in the Basel framework, Annex 4, paragraph 92(i).
RC according to the standard approach to calculating counterparty credit risk exposure was described in the Standard Approach document for calculating counterparty credit risk exposure (see footnote 18).
-  Potential Future Exposure was a potential increase in exposure between now and the end of the risk period.
Potential future exposures for the Current Exposure Method were described in the Basel framework, Annex 4, paragraph 92(i).
Potential future exposure for the standard approach is described in the Standard approach for calculating counterparty credit risk exposure.
-  Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) was the time-weighted average of the effective expected exposure in the first year, or, if contracts in the netting set mature before one year, over the period of the longest-maturity contracts in the netting set, the weights were a proportion which was the individual’s expected exposure representing the entire time interval (see Annex 4, paragraph 2E).
This referred to the relevant amounts for calculating capital adequacy after the application of the MRK technique, credit valuation adjustments based on paragraph 9 of Annex 4 (as added to Basel paragraph 105) and specific wrongway adjustments (see Annex 4, paragraph 58).

-  Standardized CVA capital charge: The amount of the standardized capital charge calculated pursuant to paragraph 104 of Annex 4 of the Basel framework or by definition according to domestic regulations where use of an external credit rating is not permitted.
This referred to the relevant amount for calculating capital adequacy after the application of the MRK technique, Credit Valuation Adjustments based on paragraph 9 of Annex 4 (as added to Basel paragraph 105) and specific wrongway adjustments (see Annex 4, paragraph 58).

In calculating Interest Rate Risk, BRI used guidelines in accordance  with SEOJK number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 regarding “Application of Risk Management and Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks “.
The method used by banks in measuring IRRBB Risk employed as follows:1.
Measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity or EVE, namely a method that measured the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of the Bank’s equity; and 2.
Measurement based on changes in net interest income or NII, which was a method that measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank’s income.
Calculation of market risk referred to the provisions concerning guidelines for using the standard method in calculating KPMM for Commercial Banks by considering market risk.
Other than the standard method above, currently BRI also  calculated market risk using the Internal Method with the calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) showing a value that described the maximum potential for losses experienced by the Bank as a result of market movements that affected the Bank’s risk exposure in normal market conditions with 99% confidence level.
The methodology used in the current VaR calculation employed the Delta Gamma method, and the Historical Simulation method was currently under development.

Exchange rate risk arised due to movements in market exchange rates that were contrary to BRI’s foreign exchange position.
Exchange rate risk was originaly from the Bank’s balance sheet assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, foreign exchange transactions with customers and counterparties that resulted in open positions in foreign currencies, as well as structural positions in foreign currencies due to equity participation.
BRI managed exchange rate risk by monitoring and managing the Net Open Position (NOP) in accordance with risk limits and regulations with the actual position at the end of December 2022 BRI’s absolute PDN of 0.83% of capital.

c Disclosure of Risk Management Implementation Report for IRRBB Qualitative Analysis 1 Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) was the risk due to movement in interest rates in the market due to the opposite of the position of the Banking Book having the  potential to have an impact on BRI’s capital and profitability, both now and in the future.
The risk of movement in BRI’s interest rates occured because the asset interest rate adjustment was slower than the liability interest rate adjustment, this was due to the composition of BRI’s assets dominated by fixed interest rates and had longer repricing maturities. 2 In mitigating IRRBB risk, BRI formulated a strategy for managing the impact of interest rate movements through the Assets and Liability Management (ALCO) and Risk Management Committee (RMC).
ALCO was held every month to discuss asset and liability management strategies, which included balanced pricing, asset allocation, funding mix, gap management, and capital management.
Meanwhile, RMC was held every quarter to discuss the market risk profile and the latest risk issue 3 BRI calculated IRRBB on a quarterly basis using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) methods.
The EVE method used a long-term perspective in calculating interest rate sensitivity to BRI’s Tier 1 capital.
The EVE method was in accordance with guidelines from the Financial Services Authority.
Meanwhile, the NII method used a short-term perspective in calculating interest rate sensitivity to BRI’s estimated revenue in the next one year. 4 The scenarios used in the IRRBB calculation are as follows:a.
Parallel Down (400 bps) c.
Short Rate Up (500 bps) f.
Short Rate Down (500 bps) 5 In calculating the IRRBB, BRI uses the following main modeling and parametric assumptions:a.
Calculation of cash flows, instruments with float interest rates using risk free sourced from JIBOR and Government Bonds for the rupiah currency, and risk free foreign exchange using LIBOR and USD Government Bonds.
The margin was sourced from the average margin of each instrument.
Meanwhile, instruments with fixed interest rates used the effective yield as the basis for determining cash flow.
Non Maturity Deposit (NMD) accounts consisting of demand deposits and savings were placed in overnight time buckets, 3 to 4 year time buckets and 4 to 5 year time buckets in accordance with the maximum caps determined by the regulator.
The NMD placed in the longest time bucket became BRI’s core fund which had a lower interest rate sensitivity than non-core funds placed in the overnight time bucket.
Determination of prepayment risk based on historical data in accordance with loan segments and products within a period deemed adequate.
The baseline calculation of prepayment percentage was the average of the total loan balance that was repaid before maturity to the total balance of the loan in each segment.
Meanwhile, in determining early redemption, the method used a historical approach with adequate data sources.
The baseline percentage used in the early redemption was the deposit balance that was repaid before maturity within a certain period of time to the total current month’s deposit balance.
In addition to prepayment risk and early redemption modeling, BRI also established internal modeling for NPL accounts.
Commercial Retail NPLs with a maximum ceiling of 5 billion rupiah were placed in a 3.5 year time bucket.
Meanwhile, the Corporate Medium NPL with a ceiling above 5 billion rupiah was placed in a 3 year time bucket.
NPL accounts included non rate where the estimated cash flow did not consider the interest.
Calculation of IRRBB used rupiah and USD.

PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 387 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.387 2022   Annual Report Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk management is described as follows: 1.
BRI managed liquidity risk so that it can fulfill all financial obligations that have been agreed on a timely basis, and could maintain an adequate and optimal level of liquidity.
The formulation of the level of risk appetite and risk tolerance related to liquidity risk had been carried out in line with the objectives of the bank’s overall strategy and business.
BRI periodically reviewed the Risk Appetite Statement and the risk limit parameters for the corporate level (bank wide) as stipulated in the Circular Letter concerning Risk-Based Bank Rating of PT.
The liquidity risk management strategy was in line with the level of risk appetite and risk tolerance in accordance with the RBB 2022 – 2024, that BRI managed liquidity risk so that it can meet all financial obligations determined in a timely manner and can maintain an adequate and optimal level of liquidity.
In managing liquidity risk, the Treasury Business Division was responsible for managing national liquidity, while the Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division was responsible for preparing and reviewing liquidity risk management policies. 2.
Funding Diversfication  This was applied by considering the characteristics of the source and the funding period as well as the Bank’s Business Plan (RBB), taking into account the counterparty, conditions for the existence of collateral, type of instrument, type of currency, and geographical location of the funding source market.
Fund Growing Stabilization  It became the maintenance of the stability of Third Party Funds (DPK) so that the growth trend was positive, including through a pricing strategy, issuance and/or development of deposit products, increasing quality marketing that supports the stability of fund growth, as well as reviewing product development and marketing policies.
Evaluation and Analysis of Funding Strategy  This activity was carried out periodically in ALCO meetings/other related meetings considering changes in internal and external factors.
The Treasury Business Division, Asset and Liabilities Management Desk together with related divisions identified, monitored and evaluated the main factors that affect BRI’s ability to obtain funding, including alternative sources of funds that could strengthen capacity to withstand crisis conditions.
Maintain Market Access  Maintaining rupiah and foreign exchange market access included: expanding the market for selling assets or increasing the number of stand-by facilities with/without collateral, actively transacting in the market in line with the funding strategy, and maintaining good relationships with providers of funds so that they could diversify sources of funds properly. 3.
Liquidity risk identification activities were carried out by each operational work unit by identifying liquidity risks originating from banking products and activities that might affect the source and use of funds, both in asset and liability positions as well as off-balance sheet accounts as well as other risks that may increase Liquidity Risk (eg Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk), both for current and future risk exposures.
Liquidity risk measurement was carried out periodically using cash flow projections, maturity profiles, liquidity ratios and liquidity stress testing.
Monitoring and control of risk measurement results was carried out by the Treasury Business Division (for example: monitoring GWM, evaluating the achievement of quarterly national cash ratios, reporting on LHBU and LBBU) and the Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division (for example: Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio) to monitor compliance with predetermined limits.
Monitoring results and liquidity risk were presented in the form of periodic reports (liquidity risk dashboard) submitted to the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners of BRI.
Regarding the results of monitoring which indicated indications of liquidity risk having the potential to increase, recommendations for mitigating liquidity risk exposure and decisions on follow-up controls were made.
The preparation of a liquidity risk profile dashboard was carried out periodically or could be adjusted according to the needs of the business strategy.
Information System Technologies used to provide up-to-date and timely information regarding liquidity at BRI are BI-RTGS, BRINets, BRISIM, Treasury and Market Risk System, SKNBI, Swift, LHBU and LBBU Portals, as well as other applications developed for monitoring assets and liabilities BRI. 4.
Contingency Funding Plana.
The Contingency Funding Plan was a plan and strategy for dealing with crisis conditions that impacted liquidity to ensure BRI’s ability to obtain the required funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
The Contingency Funding Plan was regulated and adjusted  in the Decree Number PP. 11-DIR/MPE/12/2020 Chapter 9 which regulated the Objectives, General Provisions, Methodology and Authority and Responsibilities for implementing the Contingency Funding Plan.
The CFP Trial was carried out regularly at least once a year coordinated by the ALM Desk as ALCO Secretary.
Testing the emergency funding plan was carried out using the walk on paper based method, in which all work units related to emergency funding (Liquidity Crisis Management Team) gather to carry out test scenarios on paper without making transactions on the financial market.
The Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division monitored the parameters in the Contingency Funding Plan which are listed in the daily liquidity dashboard. 5.
Liquidity Risk Stress Testinga.
Stress testing was carried out to measure BRI’s ability and resilience to meet liquidity needs during stress conditions.
Liquidity risk stress testing was carried out in accordance with BRI’s internal policies and needs and/or regulator requests.
Stress Testing was also reported periodically to the board of directors through the Risk Management Committee (RMC).
Implementation of stress testing was carried out using stress test scenarios developed by taking into account the business aspects and the level of risk managed by BRI.
The results of the stress test showed the implications of each scenario used to show the resilience of BRI’s liquidity, which were expressed as the number of days (Liquidity Surviving Days).6.
Concentration of Fundinga.
BRI set a Limit Ratio of the 50 largest depositors to third party funds with a limit of >21.95% - 23.28% for a moderate risk profile, > 24.61% for a high risk profile.
BRI set a limit for the Rupiah Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) parameter with a limit of 94.32% - 97.22% for a moderate risk profile and >98.67% for a high risk profile.
BRI sets a limit for the Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) parameter with a limit of 85.99% - 88.54% for a moderate risk profile and >91.09% for a high risk profile. 7.
Maturity Profilea.
Potential liquidity risk that BRI will face in the future is measured through a liquidity gap analysis, which is a projection of excess and shortage of liquidity based on the maturity of assets and liabilities, after considering the need for business expansion.
This information becomes a consideration in planning and managing liquidity, including the need for business expansion.
With the implementation of effective liquidity management, it is expected to minimize liquidity risk at BRI while increasing the stability of the banking system as a whole.
BRI sets a maturity profile limit of < 1 year (asset maturity < 1 year/liability maturity < 1 year) with a limit of > 88.60% - 76.00% for moderate to high risk profile and <63.40% for risk profile high.
The Maturity Profile was reported regularly by dividing the buckets :- ≤ 1 week, - >1 -2 weeks, - >2 weeks – 1 month, - >1 – 3 months, - >3 – 6 months, - >6 -12 months, - >12 months.
Operational Risk QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 1 The preparation of BRI’s operational risk management framework referred to POJK Implementation of Risk Management for Commercial Banks  No. 18/POJK.03/2016 dated  March 16, 2016 concerning Implementation of Risk Management for Commercial Banks and best practices.

Operational risk management tools PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 389 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.389 2022   Annual Report QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 2 The structure and organization of the management and control functions related to operational risk at BRI were formed by taking into account  developments in operational risk in banking and financial services institutions as well as the complexity of BRI’s business.
In this regard, an Operational Risk Management Work Unit was in managing operational risk at BRI.
Operational Risk Management Work Unit was directly responsible to the Director of Risk Management, and Operational Risk Management Work Unit consisted of the Digital Risk Division and Operational Risk Division which were divisions of the DOR Division, with respective approvals:1.
The Digital Risk Division was formed in accordance with the Decree of the Board of Directors No. 628-DIR/PPM/10/2021 dated September 1, 2021. 2.
The Operational Risk Division was formed in accordance with the Decree of the Directors No. 697-DIR/PPM/11/2021 dated  November 15, 2021.
Along with the development of digital transactions and services and to anticipate increasing cyber threats, the Digital Risk Division had the task of managing digital risk, including policy formulation, implementation of risk management processes, and monitoring and evaluation of digital risk and its controls in all Bank activities.
The Operational Risk Division focused on risk management in the operational field including the development and implementation of an operational risk management framework, policy formulation and implementation of Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Occupational Safety and Health Management System, and fraud control.
The implementation of operational risk management was strengthened by the establishment of the Regional Risk Management Department as  part of the Operational Risk Division.
The RRM Department owned the main task of maintaining portfolio and loan quality and ensuring the implementation of operational risk management and compliance at the regional level.
Taking this into account, the RRM organizational structure consisted of an RRM Head who supervised Risk Management and Compliance (RMC) and Credit Risk Analyst (CRA).
Meanwhile, the RMC located in the regional office supervises the Branch Risk and Compliance (BRC) and BRI Unit Risk and Compliance (URC) located in Branch Offices and BRI Units.
In addition, to strengthen the implementation of GCG and the application of POJK No.39/POJK.03/2019 dated  December 19, 2019 concerning the  Implementation of Anti-Fraud Strategy, according to Directors’ Decree No. 697-DIR/PPM/11/2021 dated  November 15, 2021, the Bank established a Fraud Risk Management and Recovery Desk which had the task of developing anti-fraud strategy policies, ensuring the implementation of anti-fraud strategies including prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and sanctions, as well as monitoring, evaluating and following up with the aim of preventing the risk of fraud incidents and making efforts to recover from fraud losses.
The current operational risk management organizational structure was as follows: Operational Risk Division Division Head Fraud Management and   Recovery Desk Desk HeadBCM and K3   Department Department HeadOperation Risk Strategy  Department Department HeadRegional Risk Management  Department Regional Risk Management Head ARK RMC BRC• Fraud Governance and  Strategy • Internal Fraud Analysis • External Fraud Investigation • Fraud Recovery and Reporting • Fraud Detection and Monitoring• Business Contunity Management • Governance and Implementation • K3 Policy and Implementation• Ops Risk Policy and Strategy  • Ops Risk Analysis and Culture Implementation  • Ops Risk Support (RMC, CRA, and UNKL)  • Ops Risk Support System and Technology  • RRM Support• BRC Kanca (Branch Risk Compliance)  • BRI Unit Risk and Compliance (URC) The Internal Audit Work Unit (SKAI) as the third line model had significance for the implementation of operational risk management.
Within the  operational risk management framework, it functioned as an enabler that performed assurance on the implementation of risk management.
In addition, SKAI also contributed in providing support in the form of tools to facilitate the RRM Team in verifying the implementation of controls and indications of fraud.
Conversely, Operational Risk Management Work Unit was also requested to provide data and information sources in the form of risk maps to assist SKAI in carrying out risk based audits.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 390 Management Discussion   and Analysis on Bank Performance PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.390 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 3 Explanation of the measurement system for operational risk (covering systems and data used to calculate operational risk in order to estimate the  capital charge for operational risk).
In connection with the Bank’s obligation to estimate capital charges for operational risk by calculating Operational Risk RWA using the Standard  Approach in accordance with SEOJK No.6/SEOJK.03/2020, BRI carried out measurement and calculation of operational risk as a part of the operational risk management process, namely identification, measurement, control, and monitoring.
The operational risk management process was carried out in accordance with the governance set out in the operational risk management framework  and used tools in accordance with regulatory provisions and best practices.
The process of measuring and calculating operational risk was carried out through the following activities:a.
Assessment of Risk and Control Self Assessment (RCSA)  Risk and Control Self Assessment became a qualitative and predictive risk management tool used to identify and measure risk based on the dimensions of impact and likelihood.
RCSA in BRI was implemented at the BRI Head Office Division/Desk, regional offices, special branch offices, Overseas Work Units, regional internal audit, regional campus, branch offices that also represented BRI Units, sub-branch offices and BRI Prioritas service centers.
Risk and Control Self Assessment was intended to assist work units in independently identifying and measuring operational risk in every operational and business activity, including monitoring and determining corrective steps/follow-up future plans.
Risk issue and control updates on RCSA were carried out by considering BRI’s business developments which included the implementation of new products and or activities, new market segments and business competition, changes in internal/external regulations, and other changes that affected BRI’s risk exposure.
The assessment was carried out by considering Incident Management/Loss Event Database data, Main Key Risks/Key Risk Indicators (KRI) and Audit Reports (LHA).
RCSA was carried out periodically every semester, and the frequency increased if there was a significant change in risk exposure.
Assessment of Risk Management Adequacy of New Bank Products   The application of the risk management process for each New Bank Products issuance plan at BRI was carried out through the implementation of New Bank Products Risk Self Assessment by the Product Owner and requesting an adequacy assessment of New Bank Products risk management from the Risk Management Work Unit to then be recommended to the BRI Risk Management Director in order to obtain approval.
Recording Operational Risk Losses in the Loss Event Database (LED)  LED BRI included the process of recording loss event data for each type of financial and non-financial loss which included actual loss, potential loss including corrective measures and incident handling.
Based on the loss event data on LEDs, an analysis of loss events could be performed based on the cause, functional activity, event category (event type) and BRI’s business lines.
This information system could be used to determine preventive risk control measures based on documenting incident handling/settlement processes both from a non-financial perspective, financial losses and loss recovery as well as litigation processes.
In order to calculate the capital charge and Operational RWA, BRI used the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) method implemented since 2010 in accordance with regulatory provisions.
However, BRI made preparations for implementing the Standard Approach Minimum Operational Risk Capital Measurement (MMRO) guided by the Basel III Framework and SEOJK which would calculated in the CAR ratio for January 2023 position.
Key Risk Indicator Monitoring (KRI)  KRI was a Risk Management tool in the form of a quantitative indicator that could provide early information on increasing or decreasing risk and or decreasing the effectiveness of controls against predetermined thresholds.
KRI could be leading or lagging.
Risk monitoring through KRI aimed to determine follow-up plans related to risk control so as to prevent or minimize the impact of losses.
BRI identified key risk indicators for all types of risk and established risk limits that reflected BRI’s risk appetite and conditions.
Identification of key risk indicators and determination of KRI thresholds was carried out using best judgment by considering BRI’s risk exposure and risk appetite.
The threshold determination involved internal audit, risk owners and other related work units.
BRI’s main risk indicators were reflected in the bankwide risk profile report and regional office risk profile monitored regularly and reported to management every month.
Risk Assessment Plan (RAP)  RAP was a form of risk strategy preparation activity carried out by RRM with output in the form of a list of main risks, work unit priorities based on risk and risk control activity plans.
Disaster Threat Risk Assessment  BRI implemented Disaster Threat Risk Assessment as an implementation of Business Continuity Management (BCM) to protect the security and safety of employees’ lives, protect the lives of customers and other stakeholders within BRI’s operational work units (disaster management plan), and maintain the continuity of business/operational activities.
most importantly, safeguarding BRI’s assets and having an adequate response in disruption/disaster situations (business continuity plan).
Disaster Threat Risk Assessment aimed to identify the resources needed in order to prepare for threats/disasters in each work unit.
As one of the implementations of BCM, BRI already had guidelines for an Emergency Response Plan (ER Plan) and a Business Continuity Plan (BC Plan) policy for Critical Work Units.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 391 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.391 2022   Annual Report QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 4 Operational risk management was reported regularly to management, work unit heads, and other interested parties as a monitoring tool.
The  ORD Division submitted operational risk reports, both mandatory and for internal reporting purposes.
The scope and form of operational risk management reports included:a.
Bank Operational Risk Profile  The Bank’s operational risk profile was submitted to Regulators, Directors and Commissioners on a quarterly basis coordinated by the MPE Division.
The operational risk profile included risk parameters which became the focus of monitoring the Bank’s operational risk exposure.
The Bank’s operational risk profile report was also submitted to the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and the Risk Management Monitoring Committee  b.
Regional Risk Profile  The regional risk profile contained parameters for 7 (seven) types of risk, one of which was operational risk.
The preparation of the operational risk profile was coordinated by RRM and submitted to the Regional Chief Executive Officer (RCEO) through the Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) forum every month.
Operational Risk News (OPEN)  OPEN was submitted to the Director of Risk Management and other Directors on a monthly basis.
The scope of OPEN included operational risk profile reports, achievement of risk appetite statements (RAS), incidents of human error and fraud incidents, as well as improvements to implemented controls, risk management forum activities, BCM and OHS activities, regional risk management activities, risk assessment of Bank products New (UN), RRM SMART, and external event information.
BRC/URC risk analysis report  The BRC/URC risk analysis report contained a list of control weaknesses that still occured in the Work Unit according to the results of the verification conducted by the BRC/URC.
This report was submitted by BRC/URC to Work Unit Leaders held at the Work Unit MR Forum every month. 5 The risk mitigation process became part of the risk management process, namely risk control.
Risk control was carried out in order to prevent risk events and minimize the impact of risks.
Risk mitigation measures were adjusted according to the results of an analysis of the causes of events or potential risks.
In accordance with this, risk mitigation was generally grouped into 3 (three) subs, namely: a.
People Mitigation of the people aspect was carried out in terms of quantity and quality, including:•  Determine and review the need for employee formation to carry out business processes in work units.
•  Establish requirements, mechanisms, and background checks in the employee recruitment process.
•  Carry out the fulfillment of employee formation in the Work Unit.
•  Improve worker capabilities, among others by:-  Education and training of workers in accordance with the position level.
-  Review curriculum and educational methods.
-  Provide certification for workers with certain specialists.
•  Encourage the implementation of a risk culture through Culture Activation Program (CAP) programs aligned with corporate culture.
The examples of a risk culture activation program included:-  Customer education program by all BRI employees to prevent social engineering.
-  Develop risk awareness and security awareness to strengthen control to be conveyed to all Work Units.
-  Briefing and coaching on the implementation of controls carried out by BRC/URC on a daily basis for workers in work units.
-  Risk upgrade series webinar activities which are held weekly with themes and participants adjusted to the latest concerns.
-  Production of communication media such as disaster emergency response books, risk in news bulletins, and digital risk online newsletters which are delivered to all Work Units.
ProcessRisk mitigation in the process aspect, namely:•  Develop policies and standard operating procedures (SOP) for each product and activity of the Bank which includes business processes, internal control, and the duties and responsibilities of workers as makers, checkers, signers.
Each draft policy and SOP before being ratified must obtain an assessment of the adequacy of risk management from the Risk Management Work Unit.
•  Risk mitigation was also carried out by transferring risk to a third party, namely an insurance company that bore the Bank’s losses or to a labor service provider which of course had taken into account the principles of bona fide and integrity of the service provider as regulated in the Cooperation Agreement (PKS) in every cooperation with third parties.
Technology  In principle, digital risk control was closely related to the Bank’s efforts to secure its assets, including providing protection for customer data/information.
Digital risk management in IT management activities/IT services includes, but was not limited to:•  Development, updating and deletion of electronic/digital banking services.
•  Development, updating, and deletion of IT infrastructure (computing, network, satellite) and security.
•  Development, renewal and deletion of the Bank’s internal services.
•  Procurement of IT service providers.
•  IT service provider by the Bank.
•  IT operational activities.
•  Development and/or review of Fraud Detection System (FDS) rules.
Furthermore, to strengthen digital risk control, each application development was accompanied by the Digital Risk Division.

Business Prospects and Future Strategies Even though globally it had been going on for more than 3 (three) years, the Covid-19 pandemic did not really ended.
The mutation of a new variant of the Covid-19 virus was still considered a threat that had the potential to disrupt world economic activity so that the status of the Covid-19 pandemic was still being enforced by the world health organization.
In fact, the development of daily cases of Covid-19 at the global level experienced an increase in December 2022.
This was driven by the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China since November 2022.
Daily cases of Covid-19 in China increased significantly and continued until early January 2023.
The increase in daily cases of Covid-19 prompted the Chinese government to place restrictions on people’s mobility, so that China’s economic activity was disrupted again.
Several production and demand indicators in China started to slow down due to restrictions on economic activity.
Figure 12 shows some of China’s economic indicators such as declining retail sales and production activity.
It should be noted, China had a large contribution to the world economy, namely 18.5% of total world GDP in 2021.
Therefore, if there was disruption to the Chinese economy, the negative impact was felt on the world economy.
Movement of Several Indicators of China’s Economic Activity Retail Sales (% YoY, LHS) Industrial Production: Automobiles (% YoY, LHS) Fixed Assets Inv (%YTD,nLHS) Consumer Confidence Index (RHS)2019 2020 2021 2022 Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Source: CEIC, December 2022, Data processed On the other hand, global economic uncertainty was also driven  by high geopolitical tensions in a number of countries, such as the unfinished Russia-Ukraine war and the heating up of China-Taiwan relations.
This condition certainly contributed to a deeper negative impact on the world economic recovery.
In addition, inflationary pressure, which is predicted to remain high in 2023, will have an additional impact on the recovery of the world economy, and even have the potential to push the world economy into the brink of stagflation, namely a condition in which economic growth is slowing down accompanied by high inflationary pressures.
With high global uncertainty going forward, the pace of global economic recovery in 2023 is expected to slow down compared to 2022.
In January 2023, the IMF made a downward revision to the projected global economic growth in 2022 to 3.4% from 4.4% in January 2022.
Similar to the IMF, the World Bank has also made a significant downward revision to global economic growth in 2022.
from 4.1% in January 2022 to 2.9% in the January 2023 projection.
From the domestic side, the Indonesian economy will continue its  recovery trend in 2022, even recording impressive results.
Even though in the fourth quarter of 2022 national economic growth experienced a slowdown, full year economic performance in 2022 has increased compared to 2021.
Indonesia’s economic growth in 2022 was recorded to have grown by 5.31%, an increase from 2021 which grew by 3. 70%.
The achievement of impressive economic growth was supported by strong growth in public consumption, in line with the relatively good control of Covid-19 and encouraging increased economic activity.
The government has made a transition plan for the Covid-19 pandemic to become endemic by considering Covid-19 as a part of everyday life that needs to be watched out for but not to be afraid of.
Preventive and curative steps are carefully prepared and carried out during the transitional period so as to encourage faster economic recovery.
The handling of the Covid-19 case during the transitional period of the pandemic which went well had a positive impact on community business activities.
Several economic sectors recovered and were gradually recovering, including the banking sector.
The return of people’s economic activities encouraged national loan growth which was far better than the period before the transition period.
This condition certainly had a positive impact on the national banking business, including BRI.
It was recorded that in 2022, BRI was able to record excellent performance with business growth that far exceeded the previous 2 years of the pandemic period.
Entering 2023, Indonesia’s economic recovery is expected to  continue, but has the potential to slow down.
There are still many challenges in the world economy, namely: (1) Uncertainty over the end of the pandemic (resurgence of an increase in Covid-19  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 397 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.397 2022   Annual Report cases in China), (2) The Russia-Ukraine war has not yet ended,  (3) Global inflationary pressures are still relatively higher than levels pre-pandemic, and (4) The threat of global recession, especially in developed countries such as the United States and the European Union.
The fundamentals of the national economy which are currently quite strong, especially from the domestic side, are expected to minimize the impact of external shocks on the national economy as a whole.
The acceleration of national economic recovery going forward will also depend heavily on government policies in maintaining people’s purchasing power amidst high inflationary pressures (above pre-pandemic levels).
In addition, good handling of Covid-19 cases and acceleration of vaccination are also necessary to keep people’s economic activities undisturbed, so that the economy can continue to be on a positive recovery track.
The potential for a global economic slowdown in 2023 is also  expected to have an impact on the domestic banking industry.
where BRI projects that the national banking industry’s credit in 2023 will only grow by 7.8% - 9.4% or slow down compared to 2022.
This is in line with the steps taken by entrepreneurs who tend to hold back the pace of expansion when the economy is slowing down.
However, BRI sees that the global economic slowdown in 2023  will not have a significant impact on the domestic economy, considering that the Indonesian economy is still supported by home consumption which is dominated by MSME activities which are the main customer base of BRI.
The MSME Business Index research results for the fourth quarter of 2022 show that the performance of MSME business actors in the fourth quarter of 2022 is getting better and MSMEs are increasingly optimistic in welcoming the first quarter of 2023.
This is reflected in the MSME business expectations index which increased to 130.1, an increase from the previous quarter of 126.5.
The continued recovery in MSME performance and optimism for the future strengthen BRI’s confidence in the potential for business growth in 2023.
BRI projects loan growth in 2023 of 10% - 12%, still driven by positive growth in all segments, especially in the micro segment and ultra micro.
Specifically, by taking into account various macroeconomic factors  including economic developments after the Covid-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, global geopolitical dynamics, and projected growth of the banking industry in the next year, BRI determines that the achievement of strategic objectives will be carried out by executing strategies that focus on in five aspects, as follows: 1.
CASA Sustainability   Increasing CASA market share, by developing ecosystems through territorial mastery and referrals by relying on transaction tools and cash in/cash out capability. 2.
Quality of Growth   Productive assets grow with maintained quality by focusing on assets with high yields and accelerating new sources of growth. 3.
Optimizing the Synergy of Subsidiaries  Acceleration of increasing the business scale of Subsidiaries either through synergy or independently and expansion of the Parent Entity’s business scope, completing the Holding Ultra Micro Post Implementation Plan (PIP) as a source of new growth in line with the implementation of BRI one culture. 4.
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Principles Implementation   BRI commits to managing the business by prioritizing the implementation of the values of good business governance so that it has a positive social and environmental impact (deliver value beyond profit). 5.
Excellence Enablers   BRI focuses on efforts to continue strengthening employee capabilities, system reliability, services and networks, as well as data analytics to provide superior quality banking services.
In order for the strategic focus to work well, BRI can take advantage of its strengths and opportunities, such as:  1.
BRI’s largest and most dispersed network. 2.
BRI’s capability in micro business 3.
Complete financial products and services as well as a strong brand positioning in Indonesia. 4.
A large customer base coupled with the formation of Holding Ultra Micro as a new source of growth for BRI. 5.
Banks with strong capital 6.
Digitizing loan processing 7.
First mover Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. 8.
Technological developments, digital trends, and lifestyle revolutions and people’s behavior. 9.
The number of MSMEs that have not received formal financial services is still large. 10.
An increase in the number of active internet and social media users.

Bank Rakyat Indonesia  (Persero) Tbk 2023-2025 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 398 Management Discussion   and Analysis on Bank Performance PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.398 Throughout 2022 BRI was able to collect TPF and exceeded  the target of 108.37%, this condition was not matched by the achievement of loans disbursed by achieving 98.12% of the target, which had an impact on the achievement of LDR performance that did not reach the target.
However, BRI was still able to record strong growth in the micro segment (double digits) and had achieved the target.
In 2022 BRI was able to record a net profit of IDR47.83 trillion, reaching the set target, with an achievement of 114.41% of RKA.
The achievement of net profit was supported by BRI’s ability to optimize BRI’s portfolio in the MSME segment, manage asset quality which has reached the target and the ability to manage cost efficiency.
BRI’s strategic focus on managing asset quality and operational cost efficiency has succeeded in supporting BRI’s profitability growth amidst the challenges of economic uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic and global inflationary pressures.
In addition to net income, BRI was able to achieve an asset target of 108.79%.

The SME and Consumer segments are encouraged to become growth engines outside the Micro segment in line with BRI’s 2023 focus on strengthening capacity in the retail banking segment in order to build a retail ecosystem.
Non-loan assets are projected to grow lower as a result of the growing role of the loan business, especially MSMEs, which will increase, including portfolio optimization to maximize profit.
On the liability side, TPF growth continues to increase, with the main driver being savings growth which focuses on increasing CASA.
BRI’s profitability in 2023 will come under pressure from an increase in the Cost of Fund (CoF).
However, BRI is optimistic that BRI’s profitability will continue to grow, originating from strengthening loan growth which provides high yields, increasing CASA, maximizing operating income such as FBI and Recovery, and efficiency in OHC supported by a reduction in provision costs in line with improving asset quality.
From several financial ratios, the quality of gross NPLs in 2023 is directed to be better in line with efforts to improve asset quality and economic recovery.
CoF has increased to provide space for continuing interest rate hikes until 2023.
Yield is optimized in line with the increase in BI7DRR.

Business Continuous Information  Potentially Influential Significant to  Business Continuity  Threats to BRI’s business continuity can come from potential  disturbances/disasters, whether caused by natural disasters, intentional actions, business process failures or technological disruptions.
To anticipate the impact of these potential disruptions, BRI’s Directors have developed and implemented a Business Continuity Management (BCM) Policy that has been regulated in Circular No.
SE.58-DIR/ORD/11/2022 dated  November 22, 2022 and Standard Operating Procedure No.
SO.67-ORD/11/2021 dated  November 29, 2021.
The objectives of the BCM policy include protecting the security and safety of the lives of BRI employees, their families, customers and stakeholders in accordance with the Disaster Management Plan (RPB) that they already have.
In addition, BCM aims to maintain the continuity of the most important business/operational activities, safeguard BRI’s assets, and have an adequate response in every condition, be it in normal conditions, crisis conditions, the disaster recovery phase until conditions return to normal (new normal).
Currently, the challenges from BCM apart from the 4 (four) factors above are related to the Covid-19 Pandemic in the new normal era and digitalization of the banking and financial system which can cause many disruptions, one of which is cyber attack disruption.
In addition to threats from potential disruptions/disasters, there are also threats to BRI’s business continuity originating from financial market disruptions.
To anticipate the impact of these disruptions, BRI develops and determines an Emergency Funding Plan (Contingency Funding Plan/CFP) and Action Plan (Recovery Plan) which refers to Law no. 9 of 2016 concerning Prevention and Handling of Financial System Crisis (PPKSK) and Financial Services Authority Regulation no. 14/ POJK.03/2017 concerning Action Plans (Recovery Plans) for Systemic Banks.
The CFP policy contains approaches and strategies in dealing with crisis conditions that have an impact on liquidity to ensure BRI’s ability to obtain the required funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
For conditions that are more severe, BRI will implement a Recovery Plan so that the bank is able to return to running its business in proper and sustainable conditions.

Response to Change in Monetary Policy Direction PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 421 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.421 2022   Annual Report In general, banking intermediation continued to improve driven by  increases in demand and supply.
Loan growth in November 2022 was recorded at 11.16% (YoY), supported by positive growth in all types of loan and the majority of economic sectors.
Intermediation recovery also occurred in sharia banking, with financing growth of 23.5% (YoY).
In the MSME segment, MSME loan growth in November 2022 was recorded to be quite high at 18.13% (YoY).
On the supply side, improvement in banking intermediation was supported by adequate banking liquidity and loose loan/payment standards.

Overall, these positive developments in banking intermediation contributed to economic recovery.
The resilience of the financial system especially banking was  maintained both in terms of capital and liquidity.
Banking capital remained strong with the October 2022 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) remaining high at 25.08%.
Along with strong capital, risk remained under control as reflected in the ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) in October 2022 which was recorded at 2.72% (gross) and 0.78% (net).
Banking liquidity in November 2022 was maintained supported by growth in Third Party Funds (TPF) of 8.80% (YoY).
