Economic  Review GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS Global economic challenges throughout 2019 are  quite immense.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  estimates that the global economy will only grow 3.0%,  which is the lowest growth since the 2008 crisis.
The  deteriorating trade relations between the United States  (US) -China have a major impact on world economic  activity.
The realization of economic growth, both  developed and developing countries throughout Quarter  I - Quarter III continued to slowdown.
Economic growth in the United States throughout 2019  slowed from 2.7 (YoY) in the First Quarter to only 2.1%  (YoY) in Quarter III.
In the same period of economic  growth in the Eurozone, the growth slowed from 1.4%  (YoY) to 1.2% (YoY).
In developing countries, the Chinese  economy also showed a significant slowdown from 6.6%  (YoY) in 2018 to only 6.1% (YoY) in 2019, which becomes  the lowest economic growth in the last 29 (twenty nine)  years .
Slowing down of global economic growth throughout  2019 also has an impact on commodity demand which  tends to stagnate as demand levels weaken.
The average  daily price of oil for Brent types in 2019 dropped to  USD64.2 per barrel, from USD71.1 per barrel.
This is also  experienced by global commodity prices that become a  mainstay for Indonesia, namely coal and palm oil.
The  average daily price of coal and palm oil also declined,  respectively to USD 524.7 and USD 77.0 per metric ton, from USD 559.5 and USD 107.2 per metric ton in 2018.
This also had an impact on the economies of commodity- producing countries such as Indonesia.
on the other hand, slowing down of global economic  conditions caused central banks in various parts of the  world, especially the United States (The Fed) to reduce  policy rates.
The Fed throughout 2019, lowered the  federal funds rate (FFR) policy rate by 75 bps from 2.50%  to 1.75% to anticipate the impact of the global economic  slowdown on the US economy.
In addition, other than  reducing interest rates, the Fed also implemented an  accommodative policy, namely through the purchase  of securities to overcome the tightening of liquidity in  the United States financial system.
The policy adopted  by the Fed has an impact on the flow of foreign capital  into emerging markets, including China, India, Brazil,  Thailand, the Philippines and also including Indonesia.
Based on data from the Institute for International Finance  (IIF), total foreign capital inflows into emerging markets  throughout 2019, both in the stock market and the state  bond market, reached USD78 billion, after in the previous  year, foreign capital inflows were recorded at only USD  9.9 billion.
This also gives space to several central banks  in developing countries to reduce interest rates.
This step  in reducing interest rates is expected to have a positive  impact on global economic growth in 2020.

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital DOMESTIC ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  In the midst of the enormous challenges of the global  economy, Indonesia can still maintain quite good  growth.
The Indonesian economy grew by 5.02% (YoY) in  Q3 / 2019, tending to weaken compared to growth in Q3  / 2018 of 5.17% (YoY), due to weakening global economic  growth and prices stagnant commodity.
For the record,  Indonesia's economic achievements are relatively better  compared to other emerging market countries, i.
China is slowing from 6.50% (YoY) to 6.00% (YoY), while  India has fallen sharply from 7.00% (YoY) ) to 4.55%  (YoY).
The maintained economic growth is supported by  household consumption which is still quite strong in line  with the maintained inflation condition below 3.5%, the  upper target set by Bank Indonesia.
The stable inflation rate was driven by the controlled  component of food prices in line with maintained  productivity and distribution of domestic food stock.
Inflation control is also supported by the government's  strong commitment to maintain inflation in the prices  of goods regulated by the government, such as fuel and  energy prices.
The active role of the Government and  Bank Indonesia (BI) in coordinating with the Regional  Government in maintaining inflation has also improved.
Stable macroeconomic conditions were also reflected in  movements in the IDR exchange rate which appreciated  against the USD with lower volatility compared to 2018.
Historically, IDR movements throughout 2019 were in  the range of 13,919 to 14,525 per USD (daily volatility  around 2%: - 1.33% up to 0.68%).
Meanwhile the  movement IDR in 2018 was in the range of 13,289 up  to 15,238 per USD (daily volatility around 3%: -1.45% to  1.5%).
Indicators of the trade balance and the current account  balance are relatively better because of the decline in  imports.
The trade balance in the October 2019 period  recorded a deficit of USD1.8 billion, down compared to  October 2018 of USD5.6 billion.
Meanwhile the current  account deficit narrowed from 3.3% of GDP in Quarter III  2018 to 2.7% of GDP in Quarter III 2019.
The maintained inflation rate, the increasingly stable  exchange rate movements, and the decline in the  current account deficit and trade balance indicators  provide room for BI to apply the policy mix, through  interest rate instruments and macroprudential ratios, which are accommodative to encourage economic  growth and anticipate the negative impacts of the  economic slowdown global.
Throughout 2019,  particularly in the second semester, BI has reduced the  benchmark interest rate (BI 7 Days Reverse Repo Rate or  BI 7 DRRR) by 100 bps from 6.0% to 5.0%.
In addition to lower interest rates, macroprudential  policy was taken to encourage bank credit growth by  loosening the terms of the LTV / FTV (loan to value /  financing to value) ratio of an average of 5-10% for home  and vehicle ownership, loosening the Macroprudential  Intermediation Ratio (RIM) ) to 84-94%, from 80-92%  previously, as well as expanding bank funding, including  prudent foreign loans above 1 (one) year.

The Capital Adequacy  Ratio (CAR) of banks in September 2019 is still quite  high reaching 23.28% and banking liquidity is also quite  good, reflected in the ratio of Liquid Equipment to  Deposits (AL / DPK) which reaches 19.43%.
In addition,  the gross low quality credit ratio (Non Performing Loan  / NPL) reached 2.66% (gross) and 1.18% (net) as well as  bank credit growth (Including loans distributed to other  banks) reaching 7.84%.

At the end of Quarter III 2019, total economic financing  grew by 7.4% (YoY), slowing compared to the previous  quarter's growth of 10.6% (YoY).
The slowdown was  influenced mainly by commercial bank lending, with  the highest market share of 57%, which grew slowly in  Quarter III 2019.
Meanwhile, financing sourced from the  capital market grew by 7.54%.
The continued weakening  growth of non-financial corporate economic financing  is influenced by limited demand in line with the lack of  strong business confidence. 183 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.
Annual Report 2019Information TechnologyCorporate GovernanceCorporate Social ResponsibilityCross Reference POJKCross Reference ACGSFinancial Report The Indonesian banking industry recorded a good  performance with the quality of banking assets that will be  maintained amid fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Indonesia's economic growth in September 2019 reached  5.02% due to slowing credit growth due to global economic  uncertainty that affected commodity prices and lending.
Several strategies must be taken by banks to respond  to the challenges ahead, including: (1) Selectively  encouraging credit growth in sectors that have good prospects in the next few years, (2) Encouraging sales  through increased digital transaction services, This aims  to diversify income, (3) channeling more syndicated  loans, which aims to increase credit capacity and  risk sharing, (4) Managing assets more effectively to  minimize interest rate risk, among others by shortening  the term of the assets , extend the period of liability, and  (5) Increasing interest rate hedging activities and also  encourage customers to participate in hedging.

Fee-based treasury group  income in 2019 decreased, this can be seen from negative growth, namely -0.91%.
The decrease in fee based income  came from foreign exchange transactions which fell 16.71%.
This is due to the decrease in volatility throughout 2019.
However, the Bank is the bank with the largest foreign exchange transaction revenues.
Support for fee-based income was also obtained from securities revenue which grew quite high by 36.10% from  IDR0.99 trillion in 2018 to IDR1.35 trillion in 2019.
A good trading strategy and management of a disciplined securities  portfolio was key in the midst of the bullish market of securities due to a decrease in the benchmark interest rate and  an increase in Indonesia's rating by the rating agency Fitch Rating at the end of 2019.
Other income derived from mutual fund income and fees and commissions also showed very good performance.

Nevertheless, IBFI will continue  to strive to increase its role in optimizing business growth,  both in terms of raising funds, channeling financing and  increasing transactions.
In order to support the fulfillment of liquidity needs for  Bank Mandiri, efforts to increase the volume of funds  will continue to be increased both through the collection  of deposits from customers in the financial institutions  segment and wholesale funding cooperation with  correspondent banks.
On the other hand, to support  efforts to increase quality bank assets, IBFI will focus on  lending to managed customers that meet the criteria  both to banks, securities companies, and lending through  foreign offices.
Other revenue contributions will also  be obtained from increased interbank transactions,  particularly from treasury and trade transactions (counter  guarantees and trade finance).

In terms of capital markets, the Financial Services Authority  (OJK) and the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) assess that  market volatility will still occur in 2020 but the Indonesian  capital market will still grow mainly supported by  increasing retail investors.
OJK also continues to encourage  the creation of a capital market that is resilient, efficient,  transparent and credible so that it is attractive to investors.
Various efforts made by the capital market authority  to deepen the capital market and increase the role of  investors in the country also provide positive sentiment for  the capital market business managed by the IBFI Group.
In terms of business management with insurance, there  are also opportunities for improvement, especially seeing  awareness of insurance products in Indonesia which is still very low.
Penetration of the insurance industry  in Indonesia, which is still below 3% of GDP, opens  opportunities for insurance companies and banks to  increase collaboration so as to expand market share.
The  Financial Services Authority (OJK) itself projects the general  insurance industry to record premium growth of at least  15-17% and life insurance to grow 10-11% in 2020.
WORK PLAN FOR 2020 TREASURY AND INTERNATIONAL  BANKING SEGMENTS 2020 was a year full of challenges for the Financial  Institutions business which was influenced by the global  economic slowdown, the trend of banking consolidation  and tight liquidity.
In order to support the fulfillment of  liquidity needs for Bank Mandiri, efforts to increase the  volume of funds will continue to be increased.
On the  other hand, to support efforts to increase bank assets  through lending, IBFI will focus on channeling loans  to managed customers who meet the criteria both to  banks, securities companies, and lending through foreign  offices.
Other revenue contributions will also be obtained  from increased interbank transactions, particularly from  treasury and trade transactions (counter guarantees and  trade finance).
In the future, IBFI will also strengthen its  function as a gateway inbound and outbound business  relations between Mandiri Group and counterparts both  at home and abroad.
In managing insurance customers, IBFI will increase the  company's operational accounts n insurance through the  provision of embedded solutions to meet all the needs  of insurance company transactions that have a positive  impact on increasing funds, especially low-cost funds  (Giro) through collection and payment transactions.
In addition, an increase in fee based will increase the  number of insurance and insuretech customers who  will be given a commercial line limit.
The capital market  business is also expected to grow in line with various  policies of the capital market authority to implement  better governance, thereby increasing investor and  capital market investor confidence in the Indonesian  capital market.
In 2020 Bank Mandiri Custodian will  increase Asset Under Custody through the acquisition of  224 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

MANDIRI INTERNATIONAL REMITTANCE   SENDIRIAN BERHAD (MIR) Statements of Financial Position (in thousand MYR) Description 2019 2018Growth (MYR) (%) Assets 5,266 4,818 448 9.30% Liabilities446 415 31 7.47% Equity 4,819 4,403 416 9.45% MIR’s assets in 2019 amounted to MYR5.26 million  or increased by 9.30% from MYR4.82 million in 2018.
The increase resulted from the addition of cash at the  bank.
MIR’s liabilities also increased by 7.47%, i.
from  MYR415 thousand in 2018 to MYR446 thousand in 2019.
This increase resulted from an increased payment of  loan interest.
In the previous year, MIR has added its  assets by buying 2 (two) cars to support its operations  and this year it carried out revaluation for assets with  a book value approaching zero.
MIR’s equity amounted  to MYR4.82 million in 2019 or saw an increase of 9.45%  from MYR4.40 million in 2018.

Similarly, MIR’s expenses also rose by  2.18% from MYR5.83 million in 2018 to MYR5.96 million  in 2019.
The increased expenses resulted from increased  operating expenses throughout the year, including  increases in the rent of premises, office equipment, and  office security service.
MIR’s profit of the current year  in 2019 reached MYR417 thousand or decreased by  20.57% from MYR525 thousand in 2018.
Such a decrease  resulted among other things from competition between  remittance services for the Indonesian corridor, especially  in terms of exchange rate which in 2019 contributed a  smaller amount of income of 0.8% compared with the  previous year.

Its assets  increased as a result of an injection of funds from  Bank Mandiri in 2019.
Another factor that contributed  significantly to such an increase included consolidation  with PT Mitra Transaksi Indonesia (PT MTI).
In terms  of liabilities, MCI saw an increase of 2,433.33% from  IDR6 billion in 2018 to IDR152 billion in 2019.
Such  a significant increase in liabilities resulted from  consolidation with PT MTI, making MCI have to record MTI’s liabilities to MCI’s consolidated statements.
On  the other hand, MCI’s equity also rose by 188.55%, i.
from IDR454 billion in 2018 to IDR1,310 billion in 2019.
The increase in the amount of equity did not only result  from increased capital in 2019, but also from a reduced  loss value of the current year compared with that in  the previous year as a result of a reduction in MTI’s loss  value which MCI has to absorb.

Such a significant  increase in income resulted from consolidation with  PT MTI, making it necessary for MCI to include in its  consolidated statements PT MTI’s income.
MCI also  managed to sell some shares of an investee and  contributed capital gain which in turn increased MCI’s  total income.
MCI’s expenses also saw an increase of  739.29%, i.
from IDR28 billion in 2018 to IDR235 billion  in 2019.
Such a significant increase also resulted from  consolidation with PT MTI, making PT MCI have to record  PT MTI’s expenses in PT MCI’s consolidated statements.
Such an increase also resulted from an increasing  number of employees, which increased labor costs such  as bonuses, salary, Religious Holiday Allowance, and  insurance.
Furthermore, an increase in MCI’s reserve  value also resulted in MCI’s higher expenses compared  to the previous year.
In 2019, MCI’s losses decreased by  54%, i.
from (IDR95) billion in 2018 to (IDR41) billion  in 2019.
Such a reduction resulted from an increase in  MCI’s income which far exceeded an increase in MCI’s  expenses and an increase in MTI’s Net Profit After Tax  (NPAT) compared to the previous year causing MCI to  absorb less losses from MTI, increasing MCI’s NPAT  compared to that in the previous year. 238 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Annual Report 2019Information TechnologyCorporate GovernanceCorporate Social ResponsibilityCross Reference POJKCross Reference ACGSFinancial Report BUSINESS PROSPECT Bank Mandiri views that the economic prospects of both  global and domestic will be better in 2020 compared  to 2019.
The global economy will be supported by  improving economic growth in developing countries.
Meanwhile, national economic growth in 2020 will  be supported by household consumption that is  still maintained, increased investment growth, and  accommodative BI and Government policies.
However,  we still need to watch out for the continued slowdown  in economic growth in China and the US, which are  Indonesia's main export destination countries.
Weak  economic growth in China will have a significant impact  on the development of commodity prices that are the  mainstay of Indonesian exporters such as palm oil and  coal.
Bank Mandiri believes that national economic conditions  in 2020 will be better compared to 2019.
Indonesia's  economy is expected to grow 5.14% in 2020, slightly  higher than in 2019 which we estimated to reach  5.06%.
This is supported by better growth in household  spending and private sector investment, as well as more  effective government spending.
However, we see that  the ratio of Current Account Deficit (CAD) to GDP in 2020  will be high compared to 2019 due to increased imports  of capital goods and raw materials in line with increased  economic growth.
Bank Mandiri estimates that the 2020  CAD will rise to 2.88% of GDP, lower than the 2019 Bank  Mandiri estimate of 2.60% of GDP.
In line with the improving domestic economic  conditions, national banking credit growth will also grow  higher.
Bank Mandiri estimates that bank loans and  deposits in 2020 will grow 10.2% and 8.5% respectively,  higher than the estimated 2019 growth of 9.9% and  8.2%, respectively.
Banks must maintain liquidity conditions because with  the estimated growth in deposits that is still lower  compared to credit growth, Bank Mandiri estimates that the Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratio will still increase.
Banks  need to continue to obtain funding that is more stable  and more long-term in nature, namely through retail  funding.
Banks must focus on encouraging the growth  of Current Accounts and Savings Accounts (CASA),  namely current accounts and savings with lower interest  rates, so that the cost of funds can be reduced.
One of  the main strategies in encouraging CASA is to improve  service quality and continue to maintain good relations  with customers.
In addition to reducing the cost of  funds, banks also have alternative funding besides  DPK, namely wholesale funding, including issuance of  corporate bonds and medium term notes (MTN), as well  as through bilateral loans.
To maintain liquidity and  profitability, it is very important for banks to have an  optimal funding strategy.
Seeing the condition of the economy and the banking  industry, Bank Mandiri can still take advantage of  opportunities to grow with the strength of the current  Bank Mandiri, namely: - Strong capital according to Basel III implementation - The number of networks that are evenly distributed  throughout Indonesia - Having diverse customers in each segment that can  sustain business growth.
- Having e-channel products that are more competitive  than competitor banks.
- Has a one stop financial service through Mandiri  Group, with 11 (eleven) Subsidiaries which are  leading companies and pioneers in each industry, so  that they can penetrate non-bank financial products  and services throughout the Bank Mandiri network.
- Has the option to obtain non-DPK funding through  the capital market, issuance of shares (IPO and rights  issue), corporate bonds, Medium Term Notes (MTN),  and Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (NCD).

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital STRATEGY FORWARD Entering 2020, Bank Mandiri will continue to sharpen  its strategy by paying attention to changes in  macroeconomics, industry dynamics, and internal  capabilities.
The business strategy for 2020 will be  directed to provide sustainable growth and improve  service quality for customers.
Some of the main  strategies of Bank Mandiri in 2020 are as follows: 1.

Thus it is expected that all customer transactions and  businesses will be in the Bank Mandiri ecosystem  so as to create quality asset and fund growth.
This  strategy will focus on making wholesale customer  value chain penetration, optimizing payroll, and  increasing cross selling. 2.
Digital Service Improvement and Technology  Utilization  In facing competition that does not only come  from banks, Bank Mandiri will continue to innovate  and develop various financial services, especially  those based on digital.
In addition, continuous  IT strengthening will be carried out through  infrastructure improvements, security improvements  and increased service speeds.
Some initiatives that  will be continued in 2020 include: - CASA Tech Strategy: Online onboarding,  Branchless Banking, Mandiri Online 2.0, and  Mandiri Cash Management; and - Credit Tech Strategy: Improving SME credit  processes and Online Credit Process.3.
Increased Productivity and Efficiency  In a macroeconomic condition that is full of  uncertainties and various technological disruption  and financial services, increasing efficiency and  productivity is one of the Bank's strategies to  continue to improve profitability.
Bank Mandiri will  undertake various steps and programs to control  the growth of operational costs and maintain bank  profits to meet expectations.
Some initiatives that  will be continued in 2020 include: -  Business Process Re-engineering: Reducing credit  application processing time and reducing labor  requirements -  Wholesale Credit Process Transformation:  Strengthening pipelines, improving tools for  monitoring and automation of NAK documents. 253 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital ABILITY TO PAY DEBT AND COLLECTIBILITY IN RECEIVABLES ABILITY TO PAY DEBT The ability to pay debt is reflected in the Bank's liquidity  and solvency.
With regard to bonds issued, the ability to  pay debts is reflected in the smooth payment of interest  and the ranking of bonds.
THE ABILITY TO PAY SHORT-TERM DEBT (BANK  LIQUIDITY) Pursuant to the Regulation of Bank Indonesia No. 20/4/ PBI/2018 dated April 3, 2018, in the context of encouraging  the banking intermediation function to the real sector  in accordance with the capacity and target of economic  growth while maintaining prudential principles, Bank  Indonesia issued a macroprudential policy instrument  namely the Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM)  which is an improvement on the Statutory Reserves  Minimum Loan to Funding Ratio (LFR) and has taken  effect since July 16, 2018.
RIM is the ratio of the results of  a comparison between loans granted to third parties (not  including loans to other banks) and corporate securities  owned by banks against DPK (excluding interbank funds)  and securities issued by banks.
As per December 2019,  Bank Mandiri's RIM has been 93.93%.
Although the value  of Bank Mandiri's RIM ratio is quite high, Bank Mandiri's  liquidity level is still well maintained.
In accordance with  RIM regulations, RIM targets set are Total RIM which  ranges between 80% - 92%.
If RIM> 92% but KPMM> 14%,  then Bank will not be penalized (as per December 2019,  KPMM realization amount as 21.39%).
THE ABILITY TO PAY LONG-TERM DEBT (BANK  SOLVABILITY)   Bank Mandiri’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR—is the  capital ratio towards the weighted assets based on  Risk-Weighted Assets—RWA) in 2019 has increased by  21,38% (bank only) to compare to which in 2018 20,96%  (bank only).
The ratio showed that the solvency is good  because Bank Mandiri has exceeded the minimal CAR  requirement from Regulator so that it can fulfill credit  risk, market risk and operational risk.
The sufficient liquidity of Bank Mandiri can be seen  from the Ratio Liquidity Coverage and liquidity reserves.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is ratio between High  Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and total estimation net  cash outflow during 30 days ahead in crisis scenario.
LCR is to increase bank’s durability of short term  liquidity in crisis condition.
In December 2019 LCR Bank  Mandiri reached 184,13% (Bank Only) and 177,71%  (consolidation), exceeding over LCR set by Regulator  which is minimum 100%.
Liquidity reserves are liquidity tool above GWM which  function to fulfill the need of non-scheduled liquidity.
In managing the liquidity reserves, Bank Mandiri has  limitation in form of limit safety level, which are liquidity  reserves for a month ahead.
In December 2019, the  liquidity reserves were over safety level.
ABILITY TO PAY DEBT FROM SECUIRITIES ISSUED The ability to pay debt can be reflected by the ratings  of stocks issued by Bank Mandiri and subsidiaries such  as bonds, Medium Term Note (MTN) and Global Bond.
Stocks issued are regularly assessed by rating agency  to support the feasibility.
The quality of stock heavily  depends on the ability of the issuing company to pay  stocks on their maturity dates and the ability to pay  interest or coupon during the issuance period of the  stocks.
Bonds and MTN issued are listed in Indonesia Stock  Exchange; Bank Mandiri and subsidiary use Pefindo and  Fitch Rating Indonesia as rating agencies.
Global Bonds  (Euro Medium Term note/EMNT) are issued and listed  in Singapore Stock Exchange and offered to investors  in the United States area by complying the regulation S  based on US Securities Act. 281 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital For internal goals, Bank Mandiri has also performed calculations using the Internal Method.
The calculation of Capital  Minimum Requirement using internal methods is performed by calculating Value at Risk (VaR), which is a value that describes  the maximum potential for losses experienced by the Bank as a result of market movements that affect the Bank’s risk  exposure under normal market conditions.
The Historical Simulation method was used to obtain the VaR value.
The Realization of Value Risk of Bank Mandiri in 2019 is as follows: Table 7.2 Disclosure of Market Risk by Using Internal Models (Value at Risk / VaR) – Bank only No Risk TypeDecember 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 "VaR   Average""VaR   Maximum""VaR   Mini- mum""VaR   End Period""VaR   Average""VaR   Maximum""VaR   Minimum""VaR   End Period" (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) 1 Interest Rate Risk 13,833 29,191 3,933 5,109 21,426 35,131 7,100 14,256 2 Exchange Rate Risk 17,095 62,359 2,133 22,572 10,846 35,831 1,845 23,528 3 Option risk 3,798 6,815 1,746 2,095 2,990 5,666 603,47 2,452 Total 27,117 81,837 8,379 33,381 36,457 66,154 12,480 12,480 Disclosure of Exposure of Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB)  Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book or Interest Rate Risk in The Banking Book is a risk due to movement of interest  rates in the market that is opposite to the Banking Book position, which has the potential to have an impact on the  Bank's capital and income both now and in the future.
In accordance with FSA Circular Letter number 12 / SEOJK.03 / 2018 regarding "Application of Risk Management and  Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking  Book) for Commercial Banks", the Bank uses 2 (two) methods in conducting IRRBB Risk measurement as follows: a.
Measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity, hereinafter abbreviated as EVE, is a method that  measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of the Bank's equity; and b.
Measurement based on changes in net interest income, hereinafter referred to as NII, is a method that measures  the impact of changes in interest rates on bank income.
Based on the sensitivity analysis simulation results in the end of 2019, the impact of changes in interest rates on the  economic value of equity and net interest income is as follows: Table 7.3 Disclosure of Exposure to Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRBB) (in million IDR) PeriodeΔEVE ΔNII 2019* 2018 2019* 2018 Parallel up  8,299,949  n.

Exchange rate risk originates from the Bank's balance sheet assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, foreign exchange  transactions with customers and counterparties that cause open positions in foreign currencies, as well as structural  positions in foreign exchange due to equity participation.
Bank Mandiri manages exchange rate risk by monitoring and  managing the Net Open Position (NOP) in accordance with internal limits and regulations.
As of the end of December  2019, the absolute overall NOP was 1.19% of the capital.
IRRBB Qualitative Analysis 1 Explanation of how the Bank defines IRRBB for risk measurement and control.
Interest rate risk in the Banking Book or Interest Rate Risk in The Banking Book, hereinafter abbreviated as IRRBB, is a risk  due to interest rate movements in the market that are opposite to the Banking Book position, which has the potential to  have an impact on the Bank's capital and earnings (earnings) both for the time being this as well as in the future The Bank measures IRRBB using two methods, namely measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity or  abbreviated ∆EVE and measurements based on changes in net interest income or abbreviated as IINII.
The ∆EVE and ∆NII  simulations are carried out according to the scenario of rising and decreasing interest rates (rate shock) in FSA Circular  Letter Number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 on August 21, 2018.
The Bank carries out control and mitigation of interest rate risk  through asset and liability recomposition strategies or hedging strategies.    2 Description of the IRRBB management and mitigation strategy.
The Bank determines the IRRBB control strategy which is in line with the Bank's overall business strategy by taking into  account the level of risk to be taken (risk appetite) and risk tolerance approved by the Board of Directors.
Meanwhile, the IRRBB mitigation strategy for changes in the economic value of capital (∆EEVE) is determined depending  on the position duration (average repricing maturity) of assets and liabilities.
As per June 30, 2019, Individual ∆EEVE Bank  Mandiri by 5.60% was still far below the regulator limit of 15%.
Under these conditions, the Bank implemented a strategy of  maintaining the profile duration assets and liabilities duration in accordance with the realization.    3 Periodization of bank IRRBB calculations, and an explanation of the specific actions used by banks to measure  sensitivity to IRRBB.
To ensure that the IRRBB is properly monitored, the Bank performs an IRRBB calculation for each position at the end of  the reporting month and reports and publishes for each position at the end of the quarterly report in accordance with  applicable regulations.
Measurement of sensitivity to IRRBB is carried out according to the provisions in FSA Circular Letter  Number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 dated August 21, 2018, among others as follows: a) The IRRBB calculation takes into account the entire Banking Book position by issuing equity and is grouped based on  material currency positions for the Bank b) The ∆EVE calculation does not take into account the existence of commercial margins in cash flows and discounts on cash  flows. 326 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.
Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital IRRBB Qualitative Analysis 4 An explanation of the interest rate shock scenario and the stress scenario used by banks to estimate changes in  economic value and earnings.
Measurement of IRRBB exposure is done based on 6 (six) interest rate shock scenarios as follows: Skenario DescriptionChanging Estimation Economic value Earnings Parallel Up Shock interest rates that are parallel to the top √ √ Parallel Down Shock interest rates that are parallel to the down √ √ Steepener The interest rate shock that marks the short-term  interest rate decreases and the long-term interest rate  increases (short rates down and long rates up).
√ Flattener Horizontal interest rate shock combined with short- term interest rates increases and long-term interest  rates decline.
√ Short Up Short-term interest rate shocks are increasing.
√ Short Down Short-term interest rate shocks are decreasing.
√ 5 Modeling assumptions used significantly in the Internal Measurement System (IMS) - if any.
The Bank does not have the modeling assumptions used significantly in the Bank's Internal Measurement System (IMS) that  are different from the modeling assumptions used in the IRRBB calculation report with a standardized approach. 6 Description on how the bank hedge IRRBB (if any), along with the related accounting treatment.
The Bank conducts hedging transactions for interest rate risk positions by taking into account risk appetite, business  strategies, and projections for future movements in market factors.
The Bank does not apply the hedge accounting method  in the accounting for hedge transactions.
Gains/losses arising from hedging transactions are recorded in the Bank's profit/ loss statement. 7 Comprehensive description of the main modeling and parametric assumptions used in calculating ΔEVE and ΔNII.
Here are the main modeling assumptions used in calculating ∆EVE and ΔNII: a.
The ∆EVE calculation does not account for the existence of commercial margins in cash flows and discounts on cash flows  while the ∆NII calculation takes into account commercial margins in cash flow.
Instruments that have behavioral options, such as consumer credit, retail deposits, and NMD, have calculated the  material impact on ∆EVE and ∆NII by using the early prepayment model (for consumer credit), early redemption (for time  deposits), and behavior analysis for slotting NMD based.
The model will affect the instrument's repricing time profile in  the repricing gap.
Quantitative Analysis 1 The average Repricing Maturity applied for NMD.
	The average Repricing Maturity for IDR is 2.32 years.
	The average Repricing Maturity for USD is 2.18 years. 2 Longest repricing maturity applied for NMD.
	The longest repricing maturity for NMD is 6 years.   327 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital Simulation Of Worst Cases And Stress Testing To measure the level of resilience of Bank Mandiri  in dealing with a plausible scenario of exceptional  extreme cases, Bank Mandiri conducts stress testing  as a basis for decision making (contingency plan) and  as a fulfillment of regulatory requirements applied  in Indonesia.
For Bank Mandiri, stress testing aims to  estimate the amount of loss, estimate the resilience of  Bank capital in absorbing losses, adequacy of liquidity  to meet the contractual and behavioral obligations  of the Bank, and identify steps that must be taken to  mitigate risks and maintain capital resilience.
There are 2 (two) types of stress testing conducted  by Bank Mandiri, namely sensitivity / shock analysis  and scenario analysis (historical and hypothesis).
The  implementation of stress testing covers the main  types of risks, including credit risk, market risk and  liquidity risk.
However, the calculation simulation used  statistical models and financial models developed by  the Bank with reference to industry best practices.
Specifically for credit risk, Bank Mandiri’s stress  testing model was developed to cover the wholesale,  consumer and retail segments (modules have been  developed per product for more granular and accurate  results) by referring to best practices, including through  econometric modeling that links credit risk factors with  macroeconomic factors.
Implementation of stress testing in 2018 based on  a scenario prepared by Bank Mandiri Office of Chief  Economist which broadly uses the assumption of  the impact of trade war between the US and China,  continued to increase in the US Funds Rate, volatility in  world oil prices and a slowdown of China’s economic  growth towards the Indonesian economy.
The global  pressures have an effect on exchange rate volatility, the  high flow of foreign capital in and out of the domestic  market, the widening current account deficit, rising  domestic interest rates, and slowing national economic  growth.
In general, the results of stress testing show  that Bank Mandiri is still able to maintain capital  resilience and adequate liquidity in conditions of  economic weakness, despite pressure on profits.
RECOVERY PLAN Based on the size of assets, liabilities and capital, and  the level of product complexity as well as linkages  with the banking system, Financial Services Authority  has determined Bank Mandiri as a Systemic Bank  (Domestic Systematically Important Bank).
As a Domestic Systemicaly Bank, Bank Mandiri  prepares Recovery Plans and Recovery Options to  prevent, restore and improve the financial condition  and business continuity of the Bank in the event of  financial stress, as stipulated in Financial Services  Authority Regulation No. 14/POJK.03/2017 concerning  Recovery Plans for Systemic Banks.
The prepared Recovery Plan includes an analysis  of the condition of all the Bank’s business lines and  Subsidiaries, including an analysis scenario of stress  testing that occurs on the Bank in an idiosyncratic  or market-wide shock that can endanger the Bank’s  business continuity (point of non viability).
The  recovery plan has been approved by shareholders of  Bank Mandiri as of March 21, 2018 and Bank Mandiri  has issued a Medium Term Notes of IDR500 billion in  order to fulfill Financial Services Authority Regulation  No. 14/POJK.03/2017 concerning Recovery Plans for  Banks Systemic implementation of the recovery plan.
The Bank organizes Recovery Options to overcome the  conditions of capital, liquidity, profitability, and asset  quality in accordance with the trigger level set for the  purpose of prevention, recovery and improvement  of the financial condition of the Bank.
Bank Mandiri  has also conducted an analysis of the feasibility and  effectiveness to ensure that each prepared Recovery  Options can be run properly. 337 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk.

Annual Report 2019Performance HighlightsReport of the Board of Commissioners and DirectorsCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company PerformanceHuman  Capital Assumptions Used by Management in Conducting Assessment Several assumptions that become Bank Mandiri’s consideration in conducting assessment on the business continuity  are:  - Global, national and banking industry economic growth - SWOT analysis in determining Bank Mandiri’s position in the banking industry - Risk Profile - Good Corporate Governance (GCG) Implementation - Bank Rentability - Bank Capital Strength CONTROL OF NON-PERFORMING LOAN   Bank Mandiri’s credit quality continues to show improvement, bank Mandiri's gross NPL ratio on a consolidated basis  in September 2019 managed to drop significantly by 48bps (YoY) to reach 2.53%.
That gross NPL ratio is the lowest  figure since the third trimester of 2015.
Meanwhile the Cost of Credit ratio has reached 1.65% improving 29bps from  the same period of previous year that had reached 1.94%.
Bank Mandiri has a strategy to continue to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner, while prioritizing the principle  of prudence through credit distribution to sector with lower credit risk and strengthening risk management.
Especially  for the credit quality improvement and suppressing the NPL and Cost of Credit the efforts conducted are as follows: - Full account assessment towards performing credit (collectability 1 and 2) that was included in the watch list  category is followed by mapping to project debtors who still continue to perform and who have the potential to  downgrade.
- Carrying out efforts to save credit to the watchlist debtors through accelerating credit restructuring of debtors who  have good faith, business prospects and financial conditions that are getting better and collateral with adequate  security coverage ratio.
- Carrying out efforts to save credit to the non-performing debtors through rescheduling, reconditioning and  restructuring, including the conversion of credit to temporary equity participation.
- Conduct debtor review post-restructuring, including assessing the business prospects of the debtor while  taking into account market conditions and economic sectors that are the debtor's business that can affect the  performance and repayment capacity of the debtor.
- For loans that cannot be restructured, efforts will be made to reduce the debit tray (downsizing) immediately.
- Improving the coordination and cooperation with the stakeholder in managing the non-performing loan among  others PPATK, Private Auction Hall, judiciary, curator, etc.
STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING FEE BASED INCOME IN 2020 During 2019 Bank Mandiri managed to record IDR. 23.10 billion of Fee Based Income (Bank Only).
This income comes  from the provincial income, commission and fee of IDR. 12.33 billion, foreign exchange transaction income of IDR. 2.37  billion, income from increases in value of securities and government bonds of IDR. 1.35 billion and other income of  IDR. 6.69 billion.
In 2020, Bank Mandiri will continue to increase the growth of fee based income with focusing on the value chain  strategy between the Wholesale Banking segments with the Retail Banking Segment that will encourage the  development of transaction banking.
Bank Mandiri also focusing to develop the digital banking capability that will  make it easier for customer in doing transaction in the wholesale or retail segment as focused in the improvement  of Mandiri Cash Management, Mandiri Online 2.0 and Branchless Banking.

The strengthening o the Regional Treasury marketing (RTM)  function in each of the Regional Office is also one of the things done in 2018-2019 in order to improve the treasury  transaction contribution on the regional area.
RESPONSE TO A MONETARY POLICY DIRECTION During 2019, especially in the second semester, BI has lower Bi’s interest rate 7 days reverse repo rate by 100 bps  from 6.0% to 5.0% in accordance to the decrease in interest rates policy of the US Central Bank (The Fed) by 75 bps  from 2.5% to 1.75%.
The current policy interest rate is still in line with BI's policy stance to maintain the momentum  of economic growth and also overall macroeconomic stability, including indicators of inflation, the exchange rate, the  trade balance, and the current account balance.
The accommodative macroprudential policy also has been taken to encourage the growth of banking credit.
This  was done by loosening the provisions of the LTV / FTV ratio by an average of 5-10% for home and vehicle ownership,  loosening the macroprudential intermediation ratio to 84-94%, from 80-92% previously, and expanding bank funding,  including prudent overseas loans.
Several things forward that are the focus and have an influence on the direction of the BI policy mix are a slowdown  in the global economy, a more stable global financial market, domestic economic growth that is still maintained, a  current account balance that continues to improve, a stable IDR exchange rate, maintained inflation, growth credit  and banking liquidity conditions.
The current global economic growth continues to slow down due to the trade war  between the US and China.
IMF predicted the global economic growth this year will only grow 3%, which is the lowest  growth since the 2018 crisis.
This also affected Indonesia’s economic growth that continues to slow down fro three  quarters in a row to be only 5.02% in the third quarter of 2019.
Meanwhile the current condition of banking liquidity is still tight, with an LDR of 93.8% in September 2019 due to weak  DPK growth.
The economic slow down and the tightness of the liquidity also affected the slow down of credit growth.
The credit growth until September 2019 was recorded slowing down to 7.9% (YoY).
Meanwhile we are assuming  that next year's inflation is still managed in the BI target range of 2.5±1.0% this year and 2.0±1.0% in the upcoming  2020.
By looking at these various factors, we see that the room for an accommodative BI policy mix is still open,  both through interest rates and from macroprudential.
We estimate next year BI will continue to lower BI-7 DRRR  by 25 bps to 4.75% to encourage the domestic economic growth.
Meanwhile Bi also has signaled that it will expand  accommodative macroprudential policies, aimed at the development of UMKM and national development priority  sectors in the next few years.
In response to the decline in the BI benchmark rate and also the increase in the Fed Fund Rate (FFR), Bank Mandiri  selectively participated in adjusting deposit rates.
Furthermore, interest rate adjustments are also accompanied by  efforts to maintain Bank Mandiri's profit target in 2019, among others by maintaining stable yield of loans, increasing  revenue from service transactions (fee-based income) that are recurring, increasing credit volume , and decrease  in Overhead Cost (OHC).
During 2019, with the downward trend in interest rates, Bank Mandiri's yield of loans was  maintained and raised by 7 bps from 8.18% to 8.25%.
Bank Mandiri loans also managed to record growth of 6.6% to  IDR766.32 trillion, with a focus on sustainable credit growth and maintaining asset quality.

The higher DPK growth from the credit growth  managed to increase Bank Mandiri’s liquidity with the decrease of Bank Mandiri’s Loan to Deposit ratio from 96.74%  to 93.74%.
Other than that, during 2019, Bank Mandiri also actively keeps carrying out operational cost efficiency  program by encouraging improvement of business model and business process to be more efficient so that the cost  is easier to control and gives maximum benefit.
The improvement of business model is carried out through efficiency  program, the improvement of multifunction role and organizational perfection, reward and responsibility.
