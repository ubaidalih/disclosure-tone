PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2022 86 Chapter  04 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe exchange rate of the Rupiah against the USD  throughout 2022 has fluctuated, judging from the  leading macro indicators.
Bank Indonesia’s transaction  rate on January 3, 2022, was Rp14,270 per USD and closed  at Rp15,730 per USD on December 31, 2022.
Meanwhile,  Bank Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate (BI 7-days  Repo Rate) increased from 3.50% in January 2022 to  5.50% in December 2022.
The credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings, also maintained  Indonesia’s Sovereign Credit Rating at BBB with a  stable outlook in June 2022.
This assessment indicates  maintained macroeconomic stability amid global  economic uncertainty, and Indonesia’s medium-term  economic prospects were quite good.
The excellent  policy synergy and credibility between Bank Indonesia  and the Government supported financial stability and  accelerated national economic recovery.
INDONESIAN  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  INDUSTRY The Indonesian Government is aggressively implementing  the national digital transformation acceleration  program.
The critical sector to the program’s success is  the telecommunications sector, whose core business  closely correlates with internet usage and digitalization.
One of the Government’s steps to encourage the  telecommunications industry development is providing  state budget investment for digital infrastructure, which  from 2019-2022 has reached around Rp75 trillion.
Based on the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the  telecommunications industry grew by 7.14% in Q1 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic over the last three years has  caused a shift in people’s consumption patterns which  have more of a digital lifestyle and economy.
It has led  to an increase in internet needs and data usage traffic,  both fixed broadband services for domestic activities  and mobile data, which are the main factors in the  telecommunication industry development.
Another factor that improved the telecommunications  industry performance was the consolidation of two major  operators in Indonesia, namely Indosat Ooredoo and Tri  Hutchison, to become Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH).
This consolidation reduced the number of operators,  which we expected to stabilize competition and improve  Indonesia’s telecommunications industry’s health.
GLOBAL ECONOMY AND   INDONESIA In 2022, global economic growth in general still grew  positively, indicating a continuation of economic  recovery from the effects of people’s mobility restrictions  in various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic in  2020 and 2021.
Nonetheless, global economic conditions  in 2022 still experienced challenges that are not only  hindering the pace of recovery but also increasing the  risk of stagflation and global recession.
These challenges  include high inflation, strict financial policies, the  Russia-Ukraine war, which affected the global supply  chains, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in several  countries, and unmatched supply-demand requests.
Based on the World Economic Outlook (WEO) report  released in January 2023, the IMF maintains the outlook  for global economic growth will continue to slow down  to 3.4% in 2022 compared to 2021 of 6.2%.
This projection  is more pessimistic than the IMF’s initial projection of  4.4% in January 2022.
Developing countries (emerging  markets and developing economies) are still the main  engine of global economic growth, with a growth of  3.9%.
Meanwhile, the economic growth of the developed  countries (advanced economies) only grew by 2.7%.
We predicted Indonesia’s economic recovery would  continue while we kept considering the impact of the  global economic slowdown.
In 2022, Indonesia’s economic  growth was at 5.31%, which improved compared to the  previous year of 3.70%.
It was supported by increased  consumption and investment activities, positive export  performance, and people’s purchasing power amidst  rising inflation.
Almost all business sectors have indicated  growth in line with Indonesia’s economic recovery.
With these developments, national economic growth is  expected to remain strong in the future.
Indonesia’s inflation rate this year was relatively high,  recorded at 5.51% (YoY) in December 2022, higher than  the previous year’s inflation of 1.87% (YoY) and higher  than the target of 3.0±1%.
It was due to the adjustment  in the fuel price (BBM) to increase inflation in the Volatile  Foods (VF) category and inflation in the Administered  Prices (AP) category.
As for the capital market, increasing  volatility in global stock markets has put pressure on  the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG).
In general, capital  market developments are still optimistic, as indicated  by the strengthening of the IHSG by 2.03% YTD as of  December 11, 2022.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW 2022 Annual Report 2022  PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk 87In addition, with the beginning of the 5G network  in Indonesia, we hoped it could accelerate digital  transformation and meet various digital needs, such  as video streaming, games, content, and other data- based applications.
Completing the migration of  analog to digital TV in December 2022 will also provide  the required spectrum to maximize the existing 5G  network.
We hope it will accelerate the internet network  distribution in Indonesia and succeed national digital  transformation program.
Indonesia, with 274 million population, has become  Southeast Asia’s most enormous digital economic  power.
The 2021 SEA economy report states that  Indonesia’s digital economy is valued at US$ 70 billion,  outperforming neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia.
It even predicted that it would double to US$146 billion  in 2025.
The e-commerce sector, online transportation,  and food ordering services mainly drive these business  opportunities.
In addition, other sectors are also starting  to show great potential for further growth.
This potential  market has encouraged operators to develop a digital  business besides the conventional business as data and  voice services.
To capture this opportunity, Telkomsel has  started this step by creating a separate subsidiary of PT  Telkomsel Ekosistem Digital or INDICO.
INDICO is a holding company that optimizes Telkomsel’s  assets and capabilities and becomes a leading platform to  create the flywheel effect innovations that will accelerate  Indonesia’s digital economy.
It is also Telkomsel’s  determination to expand its digital business portfolio  and proof to build an inclusive and sustainable digital  ecosystem.
It is by implementing Telkomsel’s digital  trifecta: Digital Connectivity, Digital Platform, and Digital  Services.
To encouraging its development in the first  wave, INDICO will focus on three digital industry sectors,  such as edu-tech (Kuncie), health-tech (Fita), and gaming  (Majamojo).
INDICO will also accelerate the presence of genuine  digital talent, which focuses on the collaboration of cross- sector start-ups, investors, and stakeholders in the digital  industry to have a more significant impact on the national  digital economy through several initiatives, which  include partnerships with Agate, one of the largest game  developers in Indonesia.
This collaboration will encourage  the penetration of local games and open up potential  opportunities for local creators and talents to contribute  to the Indonesian game ecosystem development.
TELECOMMUNICATION  INDUSTRY COMPETITION Digital telecommunications has become people’s primary  choice nowadays.
These conditions have encouraged  telecommunications operators’ competition to switch to  digital transformation.
TelkomGroup, as a digitalization  locomotive in Indonesia, will still be proactive in  comprehending market potential and opportunities to  expand its businesses.
Telkom will still commit to being  the market share leader in the telecommunications  industry.
Hence, Telkom remains focused on the three  business domains: digital connectivity, digital platforms,  and digital services.
MOBILE BUSINESS In 2022, Telkomsel remained the largest cellular provider  in Indonesia with 156.8 million subscribers and 49.5%  market share, higher than Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison  (IOH), and XL Axiata.
As of December 2022, SIM card  penetration in the cellular industry has grown by reaching  more than 100% with 316.5 million subscribers, increased  6,6% compared to the last period.
Data traffic showed  significant growth, while voice and SMS continued  declining.
We predict this downward trend will continue  due to the increase in smartphones that substitutes  traditional voice and SMS services to Over the Top (OTT)  services.
Responding to the inclining trend, Telkomsel  changed its strategy scheme from pay-as-you-use (PAYU)  to a personalized package, enhanced the subscribers’  market segmentation, and improved the diversification  initiative through Broadband and Digital Service.
FIXED BROADBAND & FIXED VOICE  BUSINESS (FIXED BUSINESS) Until the end of 2022, Telkom remained the largest fixed  broadband business operator in Indonesia through the  IndiHome brand with 9.2 million subscribers and 75.2%  market share.
The main competitors in this business are PT  Link Net Tbk (First Media), PT Supra Primatama Nusantara  (Biznet Home), PT Eka Mas Republik (My Republic), PT  MNC Kabel Mediacom (MNC Play), PT XL Axiata (XL Home  Fiber), and several newcomers that should be considered,  such as Cyberindo Aditama (CBN Fiber) and PT Oxygen  Multimedia Indonesia (Oxygen.
In addition, Iconnet,  formed by a subsidiary of PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara  (PLN), and Gasnet from the State Gas Company (PGN) are  also new competitors.
Even though dealing with many  competitors, Telkom is optimistic about being the leader  with its coverage and infrastructure across Indonesia.
PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2022 88 Chapter  04 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDATA CENTER  BUSINESS Telkom’s data center has been integrated and supported  by domestic and global networks with comprehensive  service features designed to be flexible, modular, seamless,  and scalable.
Telin, a subsidiary of Telkom that provides  global data centers, competes in the international market  with other data center providers in Singapore and Hong  Kong.
In the domestic market, Telkom Data Ecosystem  (NeutraDC), a Telkom subsidiary that manages the data  center portfolio, owns and operates Hyperscale Data  Centers in Cikarang, Enterprise Data Centers in Serpong,  Sentul, and Surabaya, and manage the operation of  Edge Data Centers owned by Telkom.
Telkom competes  with several companies that have also established data  centers, DCI Indonesia, Indosat Ooredoo, Moratelindo, IDC  Indonesia, BDx, Atria, Princeton DG, NTT Communication,  EdgeConnex, and Biznet.
The Data Center business is one of the pillars of the Telkom  Group’s digital platform business growth.
Telkom sees  rapid technological developments in data centers, with  the potential growth for data center business in Indonesia  estimated at 33% based on the 10-year Compound Annual  Growth Rate (CAGR).
This figure is one of the highest in  Asia.
Therefore, Telkom strives to develop the data center  business so that it can become one of Telkom’s growth  engines in the future.
INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC AND  INTERCONNECTION BUSINESS Traditional IDD (non-VoIP) of international traffic service  operators in Indonesia are currently only Telkom and  Indosat.
This business line is getting more competitive  with the presence of OTT and digital communication  services such as Line, WhatsApp, and Skype, which  provide VoIP services that can open international access,  resulting in a decrease in Telkom’s revenue from this  business line.
To address these challenges, Telkom  positions OTT as a customer, partner and/or competitor  through connectivity services, data centers and Content  Delivery Network (CDN) for OTT which could increase  profits for the Company.
NETWORK AND SATELLITE  INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS The infrastructure business line, particularly for towers,  is managed by Telkom’s subsidiaries, Mitratel and  Telkomsel.
Some of the main competitors in the tower  business include Tower Bersama Infrastructure, Tunas  Pratama Solutions, PT Profesional Telekomunikasi  Indonesia, Indosat, and XL Axiata.
Mitratel implements an  organic strategy through the new towers’ construction or  co-locations to serve cellular operators and an inorganic  strategy through tower consolidation within the  TelkomGroup and acquisition from other tower providers.
Telkom’s customers in the satellite business are across  the Asia Pacific region, especially Southeast Asia.
The  satellite service provides cellular backhaul, broadband  backhaul, enterprise network, TV on demand, military and  government networks, video distribution, DTH television,  aviation communications, and disaster recovery.
Telkom  competes with other operators who already have satellites  and are currently developing satellites in Southeast  and South Asia.
Telkom has two satellites: the Telkom- 3S Satellite, which operates in the 118°E orbital slot, and  the Merah Putih Satellite in the 108°E orbital slot.
Telkom  via Telkomsat also plans to place a satellite in the 113°E  orbit slot with the latest High Throughput Satellite (HTS)  technology, which has obtained usage rights in 2021.
DIGITAL BUSINESS The digital business will still be competitive with the  acceleration of information technology and digitization.
Several big competitors have penetrated vertical  industries, such as logistics, e-commerce, financial  services, and travel, so the time to lead the market is  getting shorter.
Therefore, Telkom develops digital products according  to the requirements.
Telkom orchestrates its digital  products through synergies with existing businesses  and establishes partnerships with competent parties in  vertical industries and investors to accelerate the scale of  its digital business.
Telkomsel has taken steps to develop its digital business  by establishing a separate subsidiary, namely PT  Telkomsel Digital Ecosystem or INDICO.
INDICO is an  aggregator from Telkomsel in the digital business.
In this  early stage, the Company will focus on the health tech,  edutech, and gaming sectors.
In addition, Telkom has  also developed a digital company, DigiCo, that focuses on  the B2B and B2C business segments.

Therefore, Telkom and its subsidiaries have the synergy to increase its value and provide the best digital  experience for customers.
MOBILE SEGMENT MARKET SHARE In 2022, Telkomsel had 156.8 million cellular subscribers (a decrease of 10.9%), including 120.9 million mobile broadband  subscribers (an increase of 0.3%).
Based on the number of subscribers, Telkomsel’s market share among the three  major operators in Indonesia is 49.5% for the Mobile segment, a decrease compared to the previous year due to the  impact of the merger of Indosat and Hutchison Tri Indonesia, resulting in a change in the competition with Hutchison  Tri Indonesia into the three major operators together with Indosat to became Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH).
In  addition, Telkomsel also carries out initiatives to encourage a healthier industry by focusing on sustainable growth  and higher-quality customers.

Telkomsel had planned a marketing strategy to maintain positive profitability and market share.
Telkomsel has been one step ahead of its competitors by being the first operator to offer a 5G network in Indonesia,  which other telecommunications operators later followed.
We predicted the 5G network to become a bridge for digital transformation in Indonesia and the key to developing  business competitiveness.
The Company will utilize 5G to enhance connectivity and digital platforms.
The speed  offered can open up limitless possibilities in digital transformation.
However, there are still challenges to 5G network  adoption.
We still need 5G learning and ecosystem adjustments, such as spectrum availability, devices, and user needs.
The 4G network has supported the current internet access demand, so the 5G network deployment has not been  massive and large-scale.
On the other hand, several manufacturing companies urgently need the 5G network to adopt  application solutions such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) so that it will be deployed later  at specific points according to industry needs.
Annual Report 2022  PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk 107CONSUMER SEGMENT MARKET SHARE Social distancing during the pandemic, which forced  people to do their activities at home, positively impacted  the Consumer segment.
Through IndiHome, Telkom  competes to meet people’s digital needs and has  succeeded in becoming one of TelkomGroup’s business  growth and increasing its revenue.
However, IndiHome  must compete with other large fixed broadband service  providers, such as First Media, Biznet Home, MNC Play,  MyRepublic for the middle and upper-class segment.
In addition, we should consider the existence of Iconnet (a  subsidiary of PLN) and Gasnet (a brand under PGN), and  XL Home for the middle and lower-class segment.
As of the end of 2022, IndiHome’s fixed broadband  marketing has achieved 0.6 million new subscribers,  bringing the cumulative 9.2 million subscribers.
IndiHome  has dominated the market share in fiber-based fixed  broadband services to the increasing number of new  customers.

The telecommunications sector is one of the sectors that  grew positively during the COVID-19 pandemic.
During  the pandemic, people’s consumption patterns have  shifted towards a digital lifestyle.
It has led to increasing  internet consumption and data usage, which are the  primary growth factors of the telecommunications  sector.
Telecommunications operators are competing to  expand and strengthen the network while increasing the  number of subscribers.
The telecommunications growth has contributed to  the increase in digital telecommunications services  (digital telco).
This phenomenon has also accelerated  national digitalization, one of the main programs being  intensified by the Government of Indonesia.
Telkom sees  this potential as an excellent opportunity to support  digitalization equity and quality improvement.
Therefore,  Telkom has committed to transforming into a leading  digital telco.
To accelerate the transformation, Telkom  builds a strong and competitive telecommunication  infrastructure.
Telkom will focus on developing digital  connectivity, digital platforms, and digital services  through its competence and capabilities in digital  business.
Telkom seizes opportunities to accelerate  digital business to provide sustainable growth for the  Company, optimal value for stakeholders, and benefits  for Indonesians.
The transformation into a digital telco company has  shown positive results, and as a digitalization locomotive  in Indonesia, Telkom will be proactive in looking over  market potential and opportunities for various business  expansions.
The Company implements the primary  strategy of Five Bold Moves to achieve the long-term goal  of becoming a world-class leading digital telco company  that positively impacts all stakeholders.
Each Five Bold  Moves strategy has a different impact on the Company: 1.
Fixed & Mobile Convergence (FMC) strengthens  market penetration and optimizes cost efficiency,  especially in the retail segment; 2.
InfraCo maintains the Company’s position as the most  extensive infrastructure provider in Indonesia; 3.
Data Center Co (DC Co) ensures that the Company can  capture the growth in demand for data centers;  PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2022 134 Chapter  04 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISTelkomGroup implements a strategy in the Enterprise  segment by focusing on high profitability and recurring  business lines, such as enterprise connectivity, data  center, and cloud.
In addition, regional improvement  in Enterprise segment is one of the main programs to  obtain the available market opportunity.
TelkomGroup focuses on improving tower, carrier, data  center services, network infrastructure, management  services for telecommunications network/service  providers, and domestic and regional digital ecosystems  in the Wholesale and International Business segment.

The Company also develops  a global digital hub that provides direct broadband  connectivity across Europe, Asia, and America.
To maintain business continuity and respond to customer  needs, Telkom develops its digital infrastructure,  platforms, and services to support various activities in  every segment and social stratification.
However, the  Job Creation Law’s derivative regulations are challenging  for Telkom, which regulates telecommunication  companies should share infrastructure and spectrum.
Because Telkom has the most expansive infrastructure  and network capacity in Indonesia, this policy benefits  competitors who can take advantage of Telkom’s  infrastructure network at a lower expense.
Nevertheless,  Telkom will still strengthen the Company’s competitive  advantages to accelerate its vision of becoming the  leading digital telco and create equal digital sovereignty  in Indonesia.
