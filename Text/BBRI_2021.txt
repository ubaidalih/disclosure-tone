Management Discussion  and Analysis On Bank  Performance “The formation of the Holding Ultra Micro which integrated all financial  services of BRI, Pegadaian, and PNM into one ecosystem strengthened  BRI’s role in supporting community business empowerment and  development, particularly for the micro and ultra micro segment.
This  was in line with BRI’s spirit of providing financial services with Go  Smaller, Go Shorter and Go Faster.
Holding Ultra Micro also had an  impact on the strengthening of BRI’s role in supporting the achievement  of financial inclusion targets in Indonesia that had been set by the  Government” 200 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report 201 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report  Economic    Review The COVID-19 pandemic occurring in mid- 2020 caused global economic growth to  experience uncertainty and contracted in  that year.
However, the uncertainty of the  impact of the pandemic began to find a  bright spot after the discovery of a vaccine  in early 2021.
This became the basis for the  initial stage of global economic recovery  that occurred this year.
The presence of a  vaccine is expected to minimize the spread  of COVID-19.
Hence, people’s activities will  return to normal and economic activity will  recover as they should.
In October 2021,  the IMF projected that global economic  growth would recover and move quite  expansively above pre-pandemic levels of  5.9% YoY in 2021 and 4.9% YoY in 2022.
The global economic recovery can be  seen in Figure 1 which shows an increase  in people’s mobility in 2021 and makes  economic activity increasing as indicated by  the expansive pace of the manufacturing  and service Purchasing Managers Index  (PMI).
The increase in community activity  was mainly driven by the easing of  lockdown policies from the governments  of various countries in line with the decline  in COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.
This  situation caused global production and  manufacturing activities to experience an  increasing trend.
However, even though  vaccines have been generated, global  economic recovery still face challenges  from the emergence of new variant  COVID-19.
Recently, a new variant  emerged called Omicron.
This variant was  first discovered on November 24, 2021 Global Economic Analysis Management Discussion and Analysis On Bank Performance 202 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report in South Africa.
Studies from Japan show that the Omicron  variant has a transmission rate of 4.2 times faster than the Delta  variant.
The good news is that so far the Omicron variant has not caused the daily death rate to increase.
In fact, several vaccine  manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna say their products are  powerful enough to ward off this variant.

One of these  challenges was the global energy crisis that was going on since  mid-Q3-2021.
In August 2021, the energy crisis began in the UK,  the price of natural gas in the country experienced a significant  increase.
The energy crisis was influenced by an increase in  economic activity in line with the economic recovery so that the  demand for natural gas for production activities increased quite  sharply.
However, this was not matched by an adequate supply  of natural gas, even at that time Russia reduced its natural gas  supply.
This condition led to an increase in demand for natural gas substitutes, namely other commodities such as coal, resulting  in an increase in prices for other commodities.
The trend of  global economic recovery also faced challenges from the ongoing  global supply chain disruption.
The pandemic has caused many  companies in the world to temporarily shut down, especially for  companies engaged in logistics such as containers in ports to  deliver goods.
This caused supply chain disruption because the  increase in world demand could not match the readiness to deliver  goods due to the non-normal activity of shipping companies.
The  increase in demand for goods and the non-normal activity of  shipping goods caused an increase in shipping costs.

This has led to  a significant increase in inflation rates in various countries.
The  increase in inflation rates occurred in almost all countries in the  world, especially in developed countries.
Figure 3 shows the  increasing movement steep of inflation in the developed country group compared to developing countries.
In addition to pressure  on input prices, the high increase in inflation in developed  countries compared to developing countries was caused by higher  demand growth in developed countries.
This was because the rate  of vaccination was faster so that economic activity increase and  triggered consumer demand to increase.

The US (United States) inflation rate  in 2021 experienced an increasing trend and was higher than the  inflation rate in the previous period.
This condition caused The  FED to take steps to tighten its monetary policy, by announcing a  tapering off starting at the end of November 2021.
The tapering  off policy was expected to be completed in March 2022 with the  possibility of rate increase.
Tapering off and rate increase policy  carried out by The FED could certainly have an impact on the  global economic recovery, considering that the US became one of  the main drivers of the current global economic recovery.
From the financial sector, global financial conditions experienced  looser movements in 2021 compared to 2020.
Figure 4 shows the  global financial condition index which tends to move downwards  in 2021.
This implies that the global financial sector has begun  to relax its anxiety and have better environment.
This condition  occured in both developed and developing countries.
However,  in the future, global financial conditions are expected to tighten  again in line with normalization of policies carried out by various  central banks in the world.

Had  been contracted to the lowest level in Q2-2020 of -5.32% YoY  due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, national economic  growth began to recover.
Indonesia’s economic growth rate was  again positive in Q2-2021 and recorded a growth of 7.07% YoY.
This figure far exceded the average pre-pandemic economic  growth rate of around 5% YoY.
However, this high rate of  economic growth was caused by the low base effect that occurred due to a deep contraction of national economic growth in Q2- 2020.
Nevertheless, the national economic growth rate in Q2- 2021 which continued in Q3-21 showed consistent improvement  in the direction of economic recovery in the midst of the COVID-19  pandemic.
This could be seen from the national economic growth  which remained positive in Q3-2021 at 3.51% even though there  was a second wave of COVID-19 due to the delta variant in July  2021.

All components of domestic demand experienced an  increasing trend in 2021 and were relatively higher than in 2020  (Figure 6).
From Figure 6, household consumption can be seen to  increase in 2021 compared to 2020.
This was due to the easing  of the restriction policy by the Government in 2021 compared  to 2020, which was in line with the decline in COVID-19 cases and an increase in vaccinations.
Government consumption also  moved to increase consistently throughout 2021 in order to  support the national economic recovery.
In terms of international  trade, national export performance increased from Q3-2020 to  Q3-2021.
This increase was driven by an increase in commodity  prices as the mainstay of national exports.
The national import  side also increased in 2021, and this became a sign of increased  national production activity.

This can be seen from Indonesia’s international trade  performance which was quite improving in 2021 compared to  2020.
Throughout 2021, the performance of Indonesia’s Trade  Balance (BOP) ) consistently recorded a surplus value.
In addition, the BOP value in 2021 had an increasing trend, in contrast to the  BOP performance in 2020 which tended to decrease at the end of  the year.
BOP performance that consistently recorded a surplus in  2021 was due to the export value which was always higher than  the import value (Pictures 7).

Figure 8 shows the movement of  the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar which tended  to be stable in the range of IDR14,200/US Dollar to IDR14,500/ US Dollar.
The monthly average exchange rate of the Rupiah  against the US Dollar in 2021 was around IDR14,300/US Dollar,  lower than the monthly average in 2020 of around IDR. 14,600/US Dollar.
This condition was certainly supported by the strong  national economic recovery, accommodative monetary policy  by BI and the level of national foreign exchange reserves which  tended to increase throughout 2021.
This made the national  import adequacy value (the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to  import financing) tended to be stable and was above 8 months  of import financing, far above the international import adequacy  standard of 3 months of import financing.

Throughout 2021, BI lowered the interest rate once,  at the February 2021 Board of Governors Meeting by 25 bps,  from 3.75% pa to 3.50% pa.
The lowering policy rate taken by  BI was expected to encourage economic activity by increasing  loan demand that ultimately encourage consumption activities  and national investment.
This policy was also supported by the  movement of the inflation rate which tended to be stable and  consistently below 2% YoY in 2021.
This figure was below BI’s  inflation target of 3±1% YoY.
Figure 9 shows how the national  inflation rate will move throughout 2021.
In 2022, the inflation rate was expected to increase.
This was  driven by an increase in domestic demand in line with the national  economic recovery and inflationary pressures from various  countries in the world, especially Indonesia’s main trading partner.
The possibility of rising inflation and plans for tightening monetary  policies of several World Central Banks, especially The FED, were  expected to encourage BI to carry out a tight monetary policy in  2022.
However, the policy of tightening monetary policy carried  out by BI would be gradual by considering the stability of the  exchange rate and the level of inflation to support Indonesia’s  economic growth.

Based on FSA data as of  October 2021, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was at the level  of 25.30%, higher than October 2020 at 23.83% and December  2020 at 23.89%.
The banking industry also had adequate  liquidity, as indicated by the Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 78.09%.
In October 2021, the total assets of the national banking industry  were IDR9.824 trillion or an increase of 8.27% YoY.
The same  trend could be seen in commercial bank loans which grew 3.24%  YoY to IDR5.657 trillion.
This shows the strengthening of loan  demand in line with the decline in COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.
Loan quality was still maintained, as indicated by the Non- Performing Loan (NPL) in October 2021 of 3.22%, below the  maximum level of 5% set by the regulator.
Third party funds (TPF)  grew by 9.44% YoY to IDR7.244 trillion.
The ongoing pandemic  situation encouraged people to hold back on consumption, thus  causing an upward trend in third party funds.
In terms of profitability, the national banking industry recorded  a net profit of IDR117 trillion as of October 2021 with an ROA  profitability ratio showing an increase where the ROA of the  Banking Industry in October 21 reached 1.92%, better than  October 2020 of 1.7% and December 2020 of 1. 59%. 209 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Table of Banking Industry Performance IndicatorOctober   20212020 2019 2018 Asset (IDR Billion) 9,824,498 9,177,894 8,562,974 8,068,346 Third Party Funds (IDR Billion) 7,244,983 6,665,390 5,998,648 5,630,448  Loan (IDR Billion) 5,657,605 5,481,560 5,616,992 5,294,882  Net Profit (IDR Billion) 117,996 104,718 156,487 150,013  Capital Adequacy Ratio/CAR (%) 25.30 23.89 23.40 22.97  Non Perfoming Loan/NPL Gross (%) 3.22 3.06 2.53 2.37 Net Interest Margin (NIM) (%) 4.52 4.45 4.91 5.14  Return on Assets/ROA (%) 1.92 1.59 2.47 2.55  Operating Expenses and Operating Income/BOPO (%) 83.14 86.58 79.39 77.86 Loan to Deposits Ratio/LDR (%) 78.09 82.54 94.43 94.78  Source: Indonesian Banking Statistics (Financial Services Authority, October 2021) Analysis of BRI’s Position In the Banking Industry  The comparison of BRI’s performance over the banking industry is summed up in the below details.

BRI’s loan growth in December 2021 increased  by 7.16% YoY, better than the 3.24% YoY banking industry loan  growth (October 2021).
BRI’s asset quality is still well maintained  with December 2021 NPL at the level of 3.08%, below the  Industrial NPL in October 2021 at 3.22%.
BRI implements a  soft landing strategy in managing credit risk.
BRI conducts an  assessment of credit risk according to the condition of the debtor  and downgrades loans that cannot be restructured eventhough,  it is legally possible to restructure and recognize the quality of  restructured loans in the current category.
BRI’s Third Party Fund’s growth in December 2021 of 7.14% was  below the growth of banking industry deposits in October 2021,  which grew by 9.44%.
BRI is selective in the growth of deposits,  focusing on growth in CASA in line with BRI’s strategy to reduce the  Cost of Fund.
In December 2021, BRI’s CASA was 63.3% better than  Industrial CASA’s 60.12% (October 2021).
BRI’s liquidity is still well  maintained, with BRI’s LDR in December 2021 at a level of 83.67% higher than the LDR for Industry in October 2021 at 78.09%.
There  is still room for BRI to optimize LDR.
BRI continues to improve efficiency and maintain productivity during  the COVID-19 pandemic in carrying out its operations.
The efficiency  is reflected in the BOPO ratio in December 2021, where BRI’s BOPO  was at the level of 74.30%, below the BOPO in the banking industry  in October 2021, which was at the level of 83.14%.
The achievement of good performance supports the accomplishment  of BRI 2021 profit of IDR32.2 trillion, experiencing growth of 75.53%  YoY above the industry growth of 27.4% YoY in October 2021.
BRI’s  net profit growth, which is better than the industry, is supported by  the increase in interest income, the efficiency of interest expense, and  the growth of non-interest operating income that is better than the  industry.
BRI’s profitability ratio is better than the industry, as reflected  in BRI ROA before tax in December 2021 at 2.72% better than the  ROA before tax, banking industry at 1.92% (October 2021).

However, the ongoing mutation of COVID-19  variant could become a potential for disruption in  the future affecting all national economic activities,  including the banking industry business.
On the other hand, the pandemic had changed  people’s behavior by getting used to the use of  digital technology.
This encouraged new challenges  in terms of competition in digital banking services.
The presence of digital banking services also  provided opportunities to provide innovative  services to customers.
In facing the challenges as well as the opportunities  that arise, BRI transformed to be able to compete  and grow in a sustainable manner.
BRI established  the Company’s Long Term Plan (RJPP) 2021 - 2025  with the theme “BRIVolution 2.0”.
In BRIVolution  2.0, BRI set a vision to become The Most Valuable  Banking Group in Southeast Asia and Champion of  Financial Inclusion.
To realize this vision, BRIVolution  2.0 will be implemented in 3 interrelated and  continuous phases, namely:1.
Strengthen the Core (2021 - 2022) 2.
Scale up and Scope up (2023 - 2024) 3.
Sustain (2025 onwards). 2021 is still a transition year for BRI.
BRI strengthens  the company’s internal capacity to encourage  business acceleration during the pandemic.
The  spirit of strengthening the core aspects (business  and its enablers) as a fundamental short-term  strategy was continously carried out throughout  2021.
In the next stage, 2022-2023 will be the year  for BRI to strengthen the BRI Group’s financial  conglomerate.
This objective will be realized  by expanding the business scope (scope up) of  the Parent Entity and increasing the Subsidiary’s  business level (scale-up).
Business expansion will  undoubtedly be carried out to present a complete  variety of financial service products for customers  to meet their needs.
However, the priority will be  focused on increasing the business level of the  Subsidiaries to increase their contribution on the  value of BRI Group as a whole.
Management Discussion and Analysis On Bank Performance 212 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report BRI’s strategies in the Short, Medium, and Long Term are as follows Short Term Strategy The COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, had catalyzed  major changes in consumer behavior (consumer megashift), in  which customers were increasingly accustomed to using digital  technology.
This encouraged the need for digital banking services  to become higher and blends with the activities and lifestyles  of customers.
However, the company realized that Indonesia’s  geographical conditions and population are very diverse.
Financial  literacy (both conventional and digital) that had not been evenly  distributed became one of the main reasons.
This presented a  huge challenge as well as an opportunity for BRI.
The spirit of  serving Indonesia with all our hearts was the background for the  company to remain committed to providing financial services that  reached people throughout the country.
Taking into account these conditions, in the short term, BRI  prepared strategic steps, including: 1 Asset Quality, maintaining the quality of productive assets  with a focus on loan quality (LAR), increasing the success rate  of loan restructuring, and controlling provision costs; 2.
Selective Growth, selective business expansion in line with the  direction of government stimulus, as well as exploring new  growth engines including optimization of ultra micro business  and more competitive salary based loans; 3.
Excellence Enabler, strengthening the competence of business  support aspects, especially in the fields of digital technology,  human capital, culture, distribution channels, and risk  management; 4.
CASA, increasing the acquisition of low-cost funds by  controlling the cost of funds while at the same time  encouraging customer transaction activities to maintain  deposit stability; 5.
BRI Group Synergy, strengthening business and non-business  synergies between BRI parent and subsidiaries as well as  among Subsidiaries to increase cross selling of BRI Group  products, sharing resources, and exploring new investment  opportunities.
Medium Term Strategy The Company’s medium term plan becomes a milestone for the  achievement of the Company’s vision and mission going forward.
To promote healthy and sustainable growth, the Company also  set annual themes so that the strategies implemented could be focused on achieving long-term targets.
The Company also  focused on sustainability finance where the Company did not  only grow but also cared about business sustainability and the  environment.
In the medium term, the Company will focus on  the following: 1.
Financial  Conducting business efficiency through increasing the  composition of low-cost funds to reduce cost of funds,  optimizing growth sources, especially from the micro and ultra  micro segments, increasing the recovery rate, and focusing on  business expansion, especially in the economic sector in line  with the stimulus provided by the government. 2.
Customers  Optimization of the value chain from the corporate segment  whose business value chain can be served to the Micro business  segment to encourage increased transactions, product and  service development with an omni-channel focused on  customer centricity, as well as increased synergy with the BRI  group through cross selling of products and services. 3.
Product and Process  Acceleration of business and product digitization processes to  improve customer service, improve IT reliability, develop a risk  scoring system for business risk control, and optimize big data  analytics to gain insight in improving customer service. 4.
Channel   Organizing the network through Delivery Channel  Transformation, increasing the role of BRILink Agents to  expand service coverage to customers, as well as increasing  the reliability of electronic banking devices with the support  of IT capabilities including the use of Open API.
Long Term Strategy Although the Covid-19 pandemic began to be well-managed, it  was believed that the impact of the pandemic still overshadowed  the company’s business performance in line with efforts to recover  the national economy.
As a state-owned business entity, BRI had  a role to support national economic resilience through its banking  activities.

The micro segment includes Micro Business and  BRILink Services.
MICRO BUSINESS   In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance of BRI  Micro Business was generally positive both in Loan and Micro third- party funds.
This indicated that BRI Micro Business was resilient  in facing the COVID-19 pandemic, which inevitably affected the  national economy and business.
In addition, the implementation  of programs and strategies that were appropriate to the situation  also contributed to BRI’s sound performance in 2021.
The micro segment as one of the backbones of the Indonesian  economy will always be BRI’s main business.
With professional  competence in the micro business, BRI consistently provided the  best service to the micro segment.
BRI committed to continuing  to contribute to the development and empowerment of micro- entrepreneurs in line with their evolving needs.
The existence of the micro business sector was part of BRI’s  DNA.
Therefore, BRI was committed to increasing the support  and empowerment of the ultra micro segment in 2021, which  was packaged with the spirit of digital transformation, namely  go smaller, go shorter, go faster.
Hence, BRI’s financial services,  such as the financing distribution process, can be carried out more  quickly at a more affordable cost.
In addition, BRI also continued  to increase the variety of products offered to customers, so that  they were more in line with the characteristics of micro customers,  namely loans with smaller amounts (go smaller) and shorter terms  (go shorter).

In addition to simplifying cash flow calculations, the benefits  offered by BRI to traders from using QRIS are also to support the  Government’s program to minimize the potential for COVID-19  transmission while the pandemic is still ongoing.
BRI will continue to raise public knowledge on cashless  transactions, especially using QRIS, so that transaction volume  using this integrated system continue to increase.
BRI believes  that with a simple and secure payment system through QRIS,  the business of Micro Business actors can be helped to grow  even bigger.
This growth will lead to a more positive pace of the  national economy and improved public welfare.

Micro Business Strategies In 2021 The Micro Business target in 2021 is to strengthen and maintain  BRI as a market leader of Micro Business in Indonesia.
BRI realizes  that the competition in Micro Business is getting tougher as the  competition is not only with other banks, but also with fintech  companies.
Although the economic recovery period as the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, BRI optimistic that it can  achieve its Micro loan composition target of 40% of total loan  by 2021.

Efficiency through CASA improvement and operational  efficiency of business processes. 2.
Assets quality through improving the loan distribution process  and monitoring loan through digitizing business processes. 3.
Selective growth through expansion in low-risk products and  exploration of new sources of growth. 4.
Community development  through empowerment and  increasing the capacity and capability of Micro Business  customers. 223 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report • BRI Micro Business  Collaboration with E-Commerce &  Fintech Company.
To increase the marketing reach of productive loans for the  micro segment, BRI collaborated with a number of well- known e-commerce and fintech companies such as Amartha,  Modal Rakyat, TaniFund, Esta Kapital Grab, Gojek, Tokopedia,  and Shopee.
Support To Government Programs  The Micro Business is also the form of supports for government  programs in promoting financial literacy, financial inclusion or the  economic empowerment of communities in the Disadvantaged,  Frontier, and Outermost regions (3T).
To increase financial literacy and inclusion, BRI Micro Business  has marketed its Basic Saving Account (BSA) products, namely  Tabunganku and SimPel (Student Saving) to the public.
During the pandemic, micro businesses were also fully committed  as an effort to recover the national economy by becoming the  main partner of the Government in the National Economic  Recovery Program (PEN), including: 1.
Conducting loan restructuring to protect loan affected by the  COVID-19 pandemic. 2.
Distributing Loan Interest Subsidy 3.
Distributing Super Micro People’s Business Loan (KUR) 4.
Distributing Subsidies in the form of Assistance for Productive  Micro Business (BPUM) Business Prospects and Micro Business Strategy in 2022 The micro segment, which represented around 99% of the total  number of businesses in Indonesia, had a major role in supporting  national economic growth.
Therefore, in line with BRI’s core  competence in the micro business and as an agent of development,  BRI remained committed to empowering and developing business  in this segment.
Even though the economy started to show signs of  recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic, BRI still faced pressure,  especially on the expansion of the commercial loan business in  the micro segment.
The challenges currently being faced included  competition in the micro market from both banks and fintech as  well as improving loan quality, especially loan restructuring due  to COVID-19.
These challenges required the company’s agility to  maintain the value of the micro business as a core business that  plays an important role for the sustainability of the Company.
Taking this into account, BRI’s micro business strategy was  directed at the principle of go smaller, go shorter, go faster.
The  formation of the ultra micro holding was one of BRI’s strategies to  enter the smaller segment (ultra micro) and capture the potential  of the ultra micro segment through harmonious synergy with the  ultra micro ownership of Pegadaian and PMN.

BRILink agents  could also serve MSME loans through a loan referral system and can distribute Social Assistance (Bansos) to communities affected by  COVID-19.
BRILink agents played an important role in realizing true financial inclusion for all levels of Indonesian society.
Meanwhile, financial transactions grew 27.73% from 727.62 million transactions to 929.38 million transactions in 2021.
This increase in  the number of financial transactions reflected that AgenBRILink services were close, safe and sophisticated to meet the banking transaction  needs of the public.

With this quality improvement, the overall productivity of  AgenBRILink improved.
Then, there was the BRILink Agent classification consisting of  skipper, champions and beginners agents.
The classification of  BRILink agents was calculated based on the level of the number and  volume of transactions.
This had proven to have helped encourage  BRILink Agents to compete in increasing the number of transactions  and the class of agents.
The use of this classification also provided  additional incentives for agents based on their grade level.
Current technological advances made BRILink continue to innovate  and make new breakthroughs, namely the implementation of  Electronic Data Capture (EDC) Android (Mobile Point Of Sale/ MPOS) and the application of chips technology (National Standard  for Indonesian Chip Card Specification/NSICCS).
EDC based on  Android OS with the support of the BRILink Mobile application  became a more sophisticated transaction tool for BRILink Agents  to serve the financial and banking needs of the community.
The  Android EDC contained the latest BRILink features needed by the  community in making banking transactions faster, safer and more  efficient.
From the increase in transaction security, chips-based  technology had been applied to ensure transactions remain safe.

BRILink agents could perform  banking transactions using BRILink EDC or BRILink Mobile in  real time online.
The features contained in BRILink Mobile also  continued to be updated according to the needs of today’s society.
The invasion of competitors, digital disruption and difficult  conditions due to the pandemic increasingly weakened the market  so that BRI created a new source of growth as a new opportunity  for BRILink to improve its performance by conducting partnership  initiatives.
In addition, BRI also had a mission to achieve champion  of financial inclusion.

BRILink innovations continued to develop to compete with other  competitors emerging one by one, namely the implementation  of Android-based EDC, of course, one of BRILink’s innovation  breakthroughs to continue to survive and improve its performance.
It was expected that the implementation of this Android EDC  made it easier for BRILink Agents to update the latest BRILink  features to improve BRILink’s business.
The provision of bailout  facilities was also one of the innovations to increase agent capital  in the business so that the performance of BRILink Agents could  increase.
BRI also cooperated with PT ASDP Indonesia Ferry (Persero) for ferry  ticket booking services through AgenBRILink.
In order to support  the Government’s efforts in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, BRI  and ASDP in collaboration with PT Telkom Indonesia launched the  PeduliLindung integration in ferry ticket ordering services through  the BRILink Agent, so that service users could be safer, faster and  more comfortable when buying ferry tickets, especially crossing  service users on the Merak-Bakauheni and Ketapang-Gilimanuk  routes.

Therefore, in 2022 this effort will  continue by launching a minimum of 500 cluster empowerment  programs, and the acquisition of 1 Loan Analyst 1 cluster  program.
Assuming the number of orderlies is 26,000, and the  minimum number of cluster members is 8 people, then there will  be at least 208,000 potential new micro businesses. 4.

BRI’s geographical segments are Indonesia, United States  of America, Hong Kong, Singapore and Timor Leste.
Productivity, Income and Profit of Geographic Segments  Note to desainer beri space, narasi akan ditambahkan kemudian In terms of performance, based on geography, Indonesia occupied the main composition, indeed this was due to the Company’s focus  on optimizing the potential that existed in the country.
It was recorded that until the end of 2021, performance in the Indonesian region  experienced good annual growth where assets grew 3.3%, income grew 18.08% and Profit before tax grew 37.34%.
Although the  focus was on domestic growth, the Company also had work units located overseas to capture existing business opportunities, in 2021 the  Company had officially added a new representative in Taiwan.
All of the Company’s work units located outside the territory of Indonesia  managed to record positive asset and revenue growth, although there was a slight decline in income in several work units due to the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which had not yet fully recovered in these areas.

The increase in export notes  and other claims was in line with the recovery in export activities  after previously experiencing a slowdown due to the impact of  COVID-19.
Security Purchased Under Agreement to Resell Securities purchased under agreements to resell on December  31, 2021 reached IDR54,915,498 million, an increase of 17.29%  from IDR46,818,568 million at the position of December 31,  2020.
The increase in Securities Purchased under Agreements to  Repurchased was the Company’s strategy in income diversification  and optimization of interest income.
Derivative Receivables The Company’s Derivative Receivables in 2021 reached IDR730,083  million or decreased by 53.69% from the previous period of  IDR1,576,659 million in 2020.

The increase in loan was mainly supported by an increase in  bank loans only by 7.16%, which was mainly driven by micro  loan which was able to grow by 12.98%, consumer loans  3.97%, small loans 3.50%, medium loans 4.05%.
With this loan growth pushing the composition  of the Company’s micro on a bank only and consolidated basis  to 42.06% and 46.40% respectively and the composition of  MSMEs to 81.73% and 83.86%, this further strengthened that  the Company increasingly focused on growing in the MSME  segment, especially the micro segment.
The growth of loans, receivables and sharia financing as well as  receivables from financing leases increased by 2.22% or lower  than the growth of banks alone of 7.16% this was due to the  fact that BRI Syariah loans were still recorded in December  2020, while in 2021 BRI loans were recorded.
Sharia was no  longer consolidated into the Company’s group after officially  merging to become Bank Syariah Indonesia, if without taking  into account BRI Syariah loan, the Company was able to record  a growth of 6% Table of Loans Given by Type of Use    (in IDR million)  Description 2021 2020Growth IDR % (1) (2) (3) (4) = (2)-(3) (5) = (4)/(3) Kupedes 396,952,830 351,337,166 45,615,664 12.98% Working capital 232,623,703 219,281,437 13,342,266 6.08% Consumption 189,254,118 191,306,486 (2,052,368) (1.07%) Investation 128,567,024 140,433,361 (11,866,337) (8.45%) Program 43,008,167 35,879,902 7,128,265 19.87% Syndicate 3,825,658 5,362,649 (1,536,991) (28.66%) Key Employees 185,023 186,633 (1,610) (0.86%) Receivables and Sharia Financing 9,159,501 49,065,478 (39,905,977) (81.33%) Receivable Financing 39,291,429 27,339,856 11,951,573 43.71% Total Loan Granted 1,042,867,453 1,020,192,968 22,674,485 2.22% Less allowance for impairment losses (87,829,417) (70,394,653) (17,434,764) 24.77% Clean 955,038,036 1,090,587,621 (135,549,585) (12.43%) 275 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Acceptance Receivable In 2021 the Company’s acceptance claims reached IDR9,066,005  million, an increase of 44.57% compared to December 2020  which reached IDR6,271,176 million.

Share Participation BRI’s investment in shares on December 31, 2021 reached  IDR6,071,727 million, an increase of IDR4,571,398 million or an  increase of 304.69% from the position on December 31, 2020 of  IDR1,500,329 million.
The increase came from BRI’s investment in  Bank Syariah Indonesia (formerly Bank Rakyat Indonesia Syariah)  of IDR4,055,194,740 million or equivalent to 17.25% ownership,  which had been part of BRI’s investment since the merger was  officially carried out on February 1, 2021.
Fixed Assets In 2021, BRI’s total fixed assets reached IDR47,970,187 million, an  increase of 9.75% compared to 2020 of IDR43,706,632 million.
This increase was due to an increase in the value of land rights,  buildings, motor vehicles and computers and machines.
The fixed asset revaluation program was carried out by BRI in  2016 and 2020, then in 2021 BRI again carried out fixed asset  revaluation activities.
The increase in the carrying amount resulted  from the revaluation of land rights amounting to IDR8,125,368  million.

This increase was driven by the post  formation of reserves for productive assets which increased by  IDR4,484,494 million or 708.20%, this increase was in line with  the increase in CKPN fees formed by the Company as a form  of mitigation of the potential risk of deteriorating asset quality,  especially loan affected by COVID-19.
Other Assets – Neto Other assets as of December 31, 2021 reached IDR32,022,666  million, a decrease of 4.39% compared to 2020 of IDR33,492,467  million.
This decrease was due to a decrease in Ijarah Assets in  2020 which was recorded at IDR1,094,000 million, but in 2021 it  was nil, this was in line with the no longer consolidating PT Bank  Syariah Indonesia Tbk (formerly Bank Rakyat Indonesia Syariah)  into the Company’s consolidated reports.

As of the  end of December 2021, the Net Cash used for investment activities was IDR(73,095,605) million or a decrease of -37.23% compared  to the position in December 2020 of IDR(116,449,356) million.

As of the end of December 2021,  Net Cash obtained from funding activities recorded a surplus of  IDR22,643,854 million.
The cash surplus from funding activities  was inseparable from the cash proceeds of IDR41,059,206 from  the rights issue process carried out by the Company, while the  deduction was derived from several activities, including distribution  of profits for dividends, payment of maturing securities and  payment of loans received. 291 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Ability to Pay Debt and Collectibility   In Receivables  Ability To Pay Debt  The ability to pay debt is reflected in the Bank’s liquidity and  solvency.
With regard to bonds issued, the ability to pay debts  is reflected in the smooth payment of interest and the ranking  of bonds.
The Company had a policy regarding the fulfillment of creditor  rights stated in each Credit Agreement between BRI and debtors.
The agreement included the rights and obligations of both parties,  such as transparency of financial reports to creditors.
The Ability To Pay Short-Term Debt   (Bank Liquidity) The liquidity ratio is a comparison between loans and deposits  (loan to deposit ratio or LDR).
BRI  LDR ratio in 2021 was  83.67% (banks only), a decrease compared to the 2020 LDR of  83.66% (banks only), indicating that liquidity conditions could  still be well maintained amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
On a  year-on-year basis, the downward trend in LDR was inseparable  from the abundance of savings during the pandemic, although  loan demand gradually increased.
(Divisi ALM) In accordance with Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number  20/4/PBI/2018 dated April 3, 2018, the bank had to maintain  a RIM ratio of 84% to 94%.
In the calculation of RIM, it  considered the securities issued and administered by the  Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI), and it was not  owned by the bank at least 2 (two) months prior to the report  date and the corporate bonds held.
RIM’s calculations were also  refined with PBI number 21/12/PBI/2019 which took effect on  December 2, 2019 by taking into account offshore loans as  a funding component.
The RIM BRI 2021 ratio was 83.45%  (banks only), an increase compared to 2020 which was 82.78%  (banks only).
The increase in the BRI RIM ratio in 2021 was  influenced by an increase in the composition of assets which  was higher than the increase in the composition of liabilities, and there was also the addition of the Export Bills component  which began to be taken into account since May 2021.
(Divisi  Treasury) In order to improve short-term liquidity resilience, BRI managed  the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the ratio between High  Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and the total net cash outflows  for the next 30 (thirty) days under conditions crisis.
In 2021,  BRI’s LCR was maintained at 219.33% (banks only), with  the achievement of this LCR, BRI managed to maintain a  liquidity adequacy ratio well above the minimum limit of  100%.
Meanwhile, in order to maintain long-term liquidity  resilience, BRI measured the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)  as a comparison between available stable funding and required  stable funding.
In 2021, BRI’s NSFR ratio was at 136.94%,  with this achievement BRI succeeded in maintaining long-term  stable funding adequacy above 100%.
(Divisi MPE) The Ability To Pay Long-Term Debt (Bank  Solvability) The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) reflected the Bank’s ability to  mitigate risks.
In 2021, BRI’s CAR was recorded at 25.28% (banks  only), up from 2020 which was 20.61% (banks only), the CAR ratio  was still far above the minimum ratio that must be maintained by  BRI of 14.75% or 12.00% if taking into account the relaxation  of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) until March 2022 and  still above BRI’s Risk Appetite Statement by 17%.
With this high  capital adequacy ratio, BRI was able to anticipate all major risks  that occur in bank management, including market risk, credit risk  and operational risk as well as the implementation of Basel 3.
Ability To Pay Debt From Issued Securities  The ability to pay debts can also be reflected based on the rating  of the securities issued by the Bank, namely Bonds.
Securities  issued were routinely assessed by rating agencies to support  the suitability of securities.
The quality of securities was largely  determined by the ability of the issuing company to pay its  securities at maturity and the ability to pay interest or coupons  during the period of issuance of the securities.

Other Financial Ratios Rentability Ratio  In the banking industry, the profitability ratio was generally measured using the rate of return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and  net interest income margin (Net Interest Margin/NIM).
BRI was able to record a positive profitability performance during 2021.
Table of Rentability Ratio        (Bank Only, in %) Description 2021 2020 (1) (2) (3) ROA 2.72 1.98 ROE 16.87 11.05 NIM 6.89 6.00 Return On Assets (ROA)  BRI’s Return on Assets (ROA) was 2.72% (banks only) in 2021, or  an increase of 0.74% compared to 2020 which was 1.98% (banks  only).
The increase in ROA was inseparable from the increase in  the Company’s performance driven by growth in interest income  and the Company’s ability to drive interest expense efficiency  while continuing to grow in non-interest non-operating income.
Return on Equity (ROE) In 2021, BRI’s Return on Equity (ROE) was 16.87% (banks only),  or an increase of 5.82% compared to 2020 which was 11.05%  (banks only).
The increase in ROE was inseparable from the  increase in the Company’s net profit which grew by 75.5% year  on year.
Net Interest Margin (NIM) BRI’s Net Interest Income Margin (NIM) in 2020 was 6.89%  (banks only) or 0.89% higher than 2020 which was recorded at  6.00% (banks only).
The increase in NIM was inseparable from the  increase in the company’s interest income generated mainly from  loa growth and the Company’s ability to drive interest expense  efficiency. 293 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Efficiency Ratio   Operating Expense to Operating Income Ratio (BOPO) In 2021, BRI’s Operating Expenses to Operating Income Ratio (BOPO) was 74.30% (banks only), a significant decrease of 6.92% from 2020  which was 81.22% (banks only).
The decrease in BOPO was driven by an increase in interest income in line with loan growth in line with  economic growth that began to improve, in addition there was a significant decrease in interest expenses as a result of the cost of fund  efficiency movement in 2021.
Table of Efficiency Ratio        (Bank Saja, dalam %) Description 2021 2020 (1) (2) (3) BOPO 74.30 81.22 Compliance Ratio Percentage of Lending in Excess of Legal Lending Limit (LLL)  In 2021, there were no debtors, related parties or otherwise, that did not meet or exceeded the Legal Lending Limit (LLL).
Net Open Position Ratio (NOP)  NOP is the sum of the absolute values of the net difference between assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position for each  foreign currency and the net difference of commitments and contingent liabilities and receivables in the administrative accounts for each  foreign currency, stated in Rupiah toward capital.
In 2021, the NOP ratio was 0.81% (banks only), up from 1.07% in 2020 (banks only).
The PDN figure was still far below the maximum  amount set by BI based on PBI No. 17/5/PBI/2015 dated May 29, 2015 regarding the Fourth Amendment to PBI No. 5/13/PBI/2003  concerning the Net Open Position for Commercial Banks dated July 1, 2010, PDN was set at a maximum of 20% of capital.
Receivables Collectability  Loan collectibility can be measured by the ratio of asset quality or Non-Performing Loan (NPL).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, BRI was still  able to maintain loan quality very well, this can be seen in the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in 2021 of 3.08%, an increase compared  to 2020 which was 2.99%.
This increase was in line with the soft landing strategy carried out by the Company, especially loan affected by  COVID-19.
Despite the increase, BRI’s NPL ratio was still below the maximum regulatory requirement of 5% nett (PBI No3/25/2001).
BRI  continued to improve the effectiveness of credit risk management to maintain and improve the quality of its assets.

Prime lending calculation does not take into account the risk  premium component of the debtor, whose amount depends on  the assessment of the risk of each debtor.
As such, the amount of  loan interest charged to debtors is not necessarily the same as the  prime lending rate.
The prime lending rate calculation applies to corporate loans,  retail loans, micro loans, and consumer loans (mortgages and  non-mortgages).
In non-mortgages of consumer loans does  not include the distribution of funds through Credit Cards and  Unsecured Loan.
However, Bank Indonesia submitted the loan  classification according to the bank’s internal criteria.

Risk Management Capital Structure  and Practice Capital Structure Management Policy For Capital Structure and  Basic Management Policy Selection Of Capital  Structure Capital structure  management is intended to ensure that BRI  consistently has adequate capital level to set off inherent risks  in its business without compromising the value provided to its  shareholders.
Productive Asset Ratio BRI manages productive assets prudently to ensure sustainable business growth.
The quality of BRI’s earning assets has increased where the  ratio of non-performing earning assets to total product assets in 2021 is 1.77% lower than 2020 at 1.81%.
BRI has established adequate  reserves to mitigate the risk of deterioration in the quality of earning assets.

OJK Regulation   No. 34/POJK.03/2016 and Bank Indonesia Regulation   No. 15/12/PBI/2013 on the obligation of Minimum Capital of  Commercial Banks, stated that level 2 (satisfactory) risk profile  has a minimum CAR of 9% up to less than 10%.
Other than  CAR requirement, as part of Basel 3 implementation, BRI must  also form additional buffer capital consisting of: 1.
Capital Conservation Buffer at 2,50%  of the Risk- Weighted  Assets (RWA) 2.
Countercyclical Buffer at 0,00% of RWA 3.
Capital Surcharge for Systematic Banks at 2,50% of RWA However, in accordance with No.17/POJK.03/2021 concerning  the Second Amendment to the Financial Services Authority  Regulation Number 11/Pojk.03/2020 concerning National  Economic Stimulus as a Countercyclical Policy for the Impact of  the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Spread, BRI as a commercial bank  for business activities could not meet the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (two point five percent) of the risk-weighted  assets.
Fulfillment of the capital conservation buffer as intended  was valid until March 31, 2022.
Hence, the total minimum CAR of BRI was at the level of  12,1%,  so that BRI’s CAR in 2021 of 25.28% (banks only)  and  27.16% (consolidated) had complied with the provisions of the  banking and financial services regulator.
In terms of capital structure, as of December 2021, BRI owned  a core capital (Tier-1) of IDR231.98 trillion (banks only)  and  IDR266.17 trillion (consolidated) and Supplementary Capital  (Tier-2) of IDR9.68 trillion (banks only) and IDR10.22 trillion  (consolidated) with a Tier-1 CAR ratio of 24.27% (banks only)  and 26.16% (consolidated).
Tier-1 BRI consisted of CET-1  because the main source of BRI’s capital was retained earnings.
Therefore, BRI’s Tier-1 Ratio was far above the minimum Tier- 1 ratio of 6% and the minimum CET-1 requirement of 4.5%  determined by the Regulator.

In calculating  Interest Rate Risk, BRI used guidelines in accordance with SEOJK number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 regarding “Application of Risk Management  and Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks “.
The method used by banks  in measuring IRRBB Risk employed as follows:Table of AJ.

Exchange rate risk arised due  to movements in market exchange rates that were contrary to BRI’s foreign exchange position.
Exchange rate risk was originaly from the  Bank’s balance sheet assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, foreign exchange transactions with customers and counterparties that  resulted in open positions in foreign currencies, as well as structural positions in foreign currencies due to equity participation.
BRI managed  exchange rate risk by monitoring and managing the Net Open Position (NOP) in accordance with risk limits and regulations with the actual  position at the end of December 2021 BRI’s absolute PDN of 0.81% of capital.

c Disclosure of Risk Management Implementation Report for IRRBB Qualitative Analysis Description of how the Bank defines IRRBB for risk measurement and control. 1 Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) was the risk due to movement in interest rates in the market due to the opposite of the position of  the Banking Book having the potential to have an impact on BRI’s capital and profitability, both now and in the future.
The risk of movement in  BRI’s interest rates occured because the asset interest rate adjustment was slower than the liability interest rate adjustment, this was due to the  composition of BRI’s assets dominated by fixed interest rates and had longer repricing maturities.
BRI measured IRRBB using the change in economic value of equity (EVE) method and changed in net interest income or NII.
The EVE and NII  simulations were carried out according to the scenario of an increase and decrease in interest rates (rate shock) in SE OJK Number 12/SEOJK.03/2018  dated August 21, 2018.
The Bank controled and mitigated interest rate risk through asset and liability recomposition strategies or hedging strategies.
Explanation of IRRBB management and mitigation strategies. 2 In mitigating IRRBB risk, BRI formulated a strategy for managing the impact of interest rate movements through the Assets & Liability Management  (ALCO) and Risk Management Committee (RMC).
ALCO was held every month to discuss asset and liability management strategies, which included  balanced pricing, asset allocation, funding mix, gap management, and capital management.
Meanwhile, RMC was held every quarter to discuss the  market risk profile and the latest risk issue.
Periodization of bank IRRBB calculations, and explanation of specific actions used by banks to measure sensitivity to IRRBB. 3 BRI calculated IRRBB on a quarterly basis using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) methods.
The EVE method used  a long-term perspective in calculating interest rate sensitivity to BRI’s Tier 1 capital.
The EVE method was in accordance with guidelines from the  Financial Services Authority.
Meanwhile, the NII method used a short-term perspective in calculating interest rate sensitivity to BRI’s estimated  revenue in the next one year.
Explanation of interest rate shock scenarios and stress scenarios used by banks to estimate changes in economic value and earnings. 4 The scenarios used in the IRRBB calculation are as follows: a) Parallel Up (400 bps) b) Parallel Down (400 bps) c) Steepener (350 bps) d) Flattener (350 bps) e) Short Rate Up (500 bps) f) Short Rate Down (500 bps) Management Discussion and Analysis On Bank Performance 360 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Qualitative Analysis The modeling assumptions used are significant in the Internal Measurement System (IMS) – if any.
Explanation of how banks hedge against IRRBB (if any), along with related accounting treatment.
A comprehensive explanation of the main modeling and parametric assumptions used in calculating EVE and NII. 5 In calculating the IRRBB, BRI uses the following main modeling and parametric assumptions: a) Calculation of cash flows, instruments with float interest rates using risk free sourced from JIBOR & Government Bonds for the rupiah currency,  and risk free foreign exchange using LIBOR and USD Government Bonds.
The margin was sourced from the average margin of each instrument.
Meanwhile, instruments with fixed interest rates used the effective yield as the basis for determining cash flow.
b) Non Maturity Deposit (NMD) accounts consisting of demand deposits and savings were placed in overnight time buckets, 3 to 4 year time  buckets & 4 to 5 year time buckets in accordance with the maximum caps determined by the regulator.
The NMD placed in the longest time  bucket became BRI’s core fund which had a lower interest rate sensitivity than non-core funds placed in the overnight time bucket.
c) Determination of prepayment risk based on historical data in accordance with loan segments & products within a period deemed adequate.
The  baseline calculation of prepayment percentage was the average of the total loan balance that was repaid before maturity to the total balance  of the loan in each segment.
Meanwhile, in determining early redemption, the method used a historical approach with adequate data sources.
The baseline percentage used in the early redemption was the deposit balance that was repaid before maturity within a certain period of time  to the total current month’s deposit balance.
d) In addition to prepayment risk and early redemption modeling, BRI also established internal modeling for NPL accounts.
Commercial Retail NPLs  with a maximum ceiling of 5 billion rupiah were placed in a 3.5 year time bucket.
Meanwhile, the Corporate Medium NPL with a ceiling above 5  billion rupiah was placed in a 3 year time bucket.
NPL accounts included non rate where the estimated cash flow did not consider the interest.
e) Calculation of IRRBB used rupiah and USD.
Foreign currencies other than those currencies were aggregated into the USD calculation.
Quantitative Analysis Average repricing maturity applied to NMD. 1 Current Accounts and Savings Accounts were deposits that had no maturities and contractually had an overnight maturity.
Meanwhile, behaviorally,  BRI placed demand deposits and savings in the overnight time bucket, 3 to 4 year time bucket and 4 to 5 year time bucket.
Distribution of BRI Non  Maturity Deposits according to the position period of December 31, 2021: a.
Current account; Overnight time bucket (56.45%), time bucket 3 to 4 years (31.11%) and time bucket 4 to 5 years (12.44%).
Saving; Overnight time bucket (17.76%) and time bucket 4 to 5 years (82.24%) The longest repricing maturity applied for NMD. 361 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report Liquidity Risk The risk is caused by the Bank’s inability to meet maturing obligations from cash flow funding sources and/or from high-quality liquid assets  that can be used as collateral without disrupting the Bank’s activities and financial condition.
BRI manages liquidity risk by measuring the  short-term and long-term liquidity adequacy ratio faced by the Bank using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio  (NSFR).

Material Information and Facts After  The Accountant’s Report Date Until the end of the Annual Report, there was no description  of significant events after the date of the accountant’s report  including their impact on future business performance and risks.
Business Prospects and Future  Strategies The COVID-19 pandemic had been in its second year where the  presence of the Delta variant resulted in a new wave of active  cases occurring throughout the world, including Indonesia.
Nevertheless, efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic continued  to be carried out with intensive vaccinations and accompanied by  the re-enactment of restrictions on community activities in several  countries.
Indonesia in the third quarter of 2021 was able to pass  this wave well, which was seen in the decrease in the number of  daily cases and the accumulation of active cases.
The recovery in domestic economic activity began, and it was  marked by positive economic growth in Indonesia in 2 consecutive  quarters, namely 7.07% YoY in Quarter II 2021 and 3.51% in  Quarter III 2021.
This growth figure shows consistent improvement  in the direction of economic recovery after the pandemic which on  an annual basis showing that all components of expenditure from  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) experience positive growth.
However, at the end of 2021, there were some global disruptions  that had slowed down the pace of economic recovery.
The global  energy crisis causing energy commodity prices to rise quite high,  supply chain disruption due to increased logistics costs, and the  re-emergence of a new variant of the COVID-19 virus with quite  massive transmission in several major countries in the world  slowed down the pace of global economic growth and had the  potential to disrupt the national economy.
By considering macroeconomic conditions, there were several  factors to consider in planning BRI’s future strategy, including: 1.
Global economic growth was estimated to improve at the end  of 2021, so that the national economic recovery would be  even stronger in 2022. 2.
Purchasing power and consumption levels were expected  to return to normal in 2022 in line with the recovery of  community activities, supported by better control of the  pandemic by the Government.
Management Discussion and Analysis On Bank Performance 380 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2021 Annual Report 3.
Banks still needed to be vigilant and careful by continuously  monitoring the development of COVID-19 cases, the global  energy crisis, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of the  US tapering plan at the end of 2021.
In line with these factors, BRI estimated that bank loan growth  would increase in 2022 by 6.4%-7.9% YoY.
Meanwhile, the  growth of banking deposits would increase in 2022 by 6.1%- 7.4% YoY.
For BRI loan growth (bank only) itself, it was expected  to grow by 9.79% YoY, and BRI deposit growth (bank only) was  expected to grow by 8.07% YoY in 2022.
Therefore, BRI’s business development during the period 2022- 2024 will take into account the development of the Indonesian  economy and be in line with the company’s long-term strategy for  2021-2025 as stated in the BRI Long Term Plan (RJPP)/Corporate  Plan (Corplan) for 2021-2025.
, namely to become The Most  Valuable Banking Group in Southeast Asia and Champion of  Financial Inclusion.
However, the uncertainty of the COVID-19  pandemic situation is believed to still have the potential to disrupt  BRI’s performance in the short and medium term.
Therefore,  BRI continues to strengthen the company’s internal capacity  to be able to more strongly encourage business acceleration in  the post-pandemic period (strengthen the core to scale up and  scope up).
The spirit of strengthening the core aspects (business  and its enablers) which has strong implications for the company’s  performance, is still relevant to be continued in the following year  as a fundamental strategy to maintain BRI’s ability to continue to  grow healthy and sustainably.
Thus, the achievement of strategic  objectives will be carried out by executing strategies that focus on  five aspects, namely: 1.
Asset Quality, maintaining the quality of productive assets with  a focus on loan quality (Loan to Assets Ratio/LAR), increasing  the loan restructuring success rate, as well as controlling the  cost of Allowance for Impairment Losses (CKPN).2.
Selective Growth, selective business expansion by utilizing  government stimulus, as well as exploring new growth  engines including optimization of ultra micro business and  more competitive salary based loans; 3.
Excellence Enabler, strengthening the competence of business  support aspects, especially in the fields of digital technology,  human capital, culture, distribution channels, and risk  management. 4.
Current Account Saving Account (CASA), increasing the  acquisition of low-cost funds by controlling the cost of funds  while encouraging customer transaction activities to maintain  deposit stability. 5.
BRI Group Synergy, strengthening business and non-business  synergies between BRI Parent and Subsidiaries as well as  among Subsidiaries to increase cross selling of BRI Group  products, sharing resources, and exploring new investment  opportunities.
BRI can take advantage of its strengths and opportunities in order  for the strategic focus to work well, such as:  1.
The largest and most widespread BRI network. 2.
BRI’s capability in micro business supported by the  government’s National Economic Recovery (PEN) program  (agent of development). 3.
Complete financial products and services as well as a strong  brand positioning in Indonesia. 4.
Huge customer base together with the establishment of Ultra  Micro Holding as one of BRI’s new sources of growth. 5.
Digitalization of loan processing for the Micro & Consumer  segment. 6.

Business Continuous Information Potentially Influential Significant to Business Continuity Threats to BRI’s business continuity can be sourced from potential  disturbances/disasters caused by natural disasters, deliberate  actions, business process failures or technological disruptions.
To anticipate the impact of this potential disruption, the BRI  Board of Directors developed and implemented a Business  Continuity Management (BCM) Policy regulated in the BRI NOSE  Circular: S.61-DIR/DOR/10/2021.
The objectives of the BCM  policy were to protect the safety and security of BRI employees,  their families, customers and stakeholders in accordance with  the existing Disaster Management Plan (RPB).
In addition, BCM  aimed to maintain the continuity of the most important business/ operational activities, safeguard BRI assets, and had an adequate  response in every condition, whether in normal conditions, crisis  conditions, disaster recovery phases until conditions returned to  normal (new normal).

In general, similar to the movement of the global recovery, the  national economic recovery was also expected to continue in  2022, but with some challenges.
The issue of a pandemic that  was still not over could continue to overshadow the trend of  national economic recovery, where if vigilance decreased, we  may “stumble” again and disrupt the recovery momentum.
The  rate of vaccination must continue to be consistent, so it is hoped  that Indonesia can achieve herd immunity when the proportion of the population being vaccinated is high enough.
In addition to  challenges on the health side, challenges from the economic side  such as disruption of global supply chains and the normalization  of monetary policy primarily by The FED also need to be watched  out for by the national economy.
The banking industry’s loan growth in September 2021  experienced a positive growth of 2.21% YoY.
This showedthat the  Indonesian economy was still able to survive despite the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the other hand, the uncertainty  of the pandemic had led to a high tendency for people to save.
This prompted an increase in the growth of banking Third Party  Funds in September 2021 to 7.69% YoY.
This had an impact  on abundant banking liquidity, this was reflected in the Loan to  Deposit Ratio (LDR) which fell quite significantly from 83.46% in  September 2020 to 79.11% in September 2021.
In response to the decline in BI’s benchmark interest rate as well  as the normalization of monetary policy by The FED, BRI selectively  adjusted the fund interest rate and the basic lending rate (SBDK).
As of December 2021, BRI’s prime lending rate is as follows: Table of Basic Loan Interest Rates (in %) Interest rate Corporate Loan Retail Loan Micro LoanConsumer Loan Mortgage Non-mortgage December  2021 8.00 8.25 14.00 7.25 8.75 In addition, throughout 2021, BRI will continue to implement operational cost efficiency programs by maintaining productivity through  digitalization and business process reengineering on an ongoing basis that prioritized strengthening transaction banking and payment  ecosystems as enablers for fee income generation and increased CASA.
Prohibitions, Limitations and/or Significant Obstacles To the Provision of Funds  Between Banks and Other Entities In a Business Groups In carrying out its business activities, BRI established a policy that included limits in providing funds to related parties in accordance with  the Regulation of the Financial Services Authority of the Republic of Indonesia Number 32/POJK.03/2018 concerning the Maximum Limit  for Lending (BMPK) and Provision of Large Funds for Commercial Banks and POJK.
No. 38/POJK.03/2019 Regarding Amendments to POJK  No. 32/POJK.03/2018 concerning LLL and Provision of Large Funds for Commercial Banks.
Provision of Funds To Related Parties and Big Funds One of the causes of the failure of the Bank’s business was the  provision of funds which was not supported by the Bank’s ability  to manage the concentration of Provision of Funds effectively.
To  reduce the potential for Bank business failure as a result of the  concentration of Provision of Funds, Banks were required to spread  and diversify the Provision of Funds portfolio, especially through  restrictions on Provision of Funds, both to Related Parties and other  than Related Parties in the amount of a certain percentage of Bank  Capital or Core Capital (Tier 1) Bank, known as LLL and Provision  of Large Funds.
Furthermore, in order to increase Indonesia’s economic growth and national competitiveness, efforts were  needed to encourage the banking intermediation function carried  out by providing concessions or exceptions in the application of  the LLL and Large Fund Providers while still observing the principle  of prudence.
Bank BRI had a policy related to Provision of Funds  to Related Parties or Provision of Large Funds (large exposure) and  or Provision of Funds to other parties who have an interest in the  Bank regulated in Circular Letter of the BRI Directors Number:  SE.36-DIR/KRD/06/2019 dated 27 June 2019 and its amendments.
