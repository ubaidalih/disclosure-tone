Economic growth of the US and China in 2019 tends to slowdown because of limited stimulus and the impact of  tariffs imposition that have been previously imposed.
Japan and Europe recorded economic recovery even though it’s  remained limited because of improving domestic demand.
Positive development on trade tariffs agreement of the US and China has decreased the risks of global financial markets  and have a positive impact on the economic development of developing countries through the inflows of foreign funds.
To address the continued weakened global economy, the world’s central banks strive to stimulate the economy by  lowering interest rates or maintain it to the low level.
The Fed for example, maintained the rate at a level of 1.75% until  the end of 2019.
This step was ensued by other central banks of both developed and developing countries, including Bank Indonesia (BI).
IndonEsIan Economy Amidst the upheaval of the world trade wars, Indonesia’s economic growth remains positive, recording a 5.02% growth in 2019, which resulted from maintained household consumption, accelerated fiscal expansion, and export  improvements.

Return on Assets (ROA) ratio  was recorded at 2.45% as of October 2019, slightly lower from 2018 position of 2.50%.

The Allowance for Impairment  Losses in 2019 was Rp39.20 trillion,  up 10.38% from Rp35.51 trillion  in 2017.
The increase of Allowance for Impairment Losses reflects BRI  prudence principles to anticipate  impact of macroeconomics fluctuation to assets quality.
With  the increase of Allowance, NPL  Coverage Ratio was maintained at 166.59% (bank only) in 2019.
In addition to establish adequate  allowance, BRI mitigates credit risk  by taking into account the loan collaterals, guarantees, warranties  or insurance.
BRI takes into account  collateral as a future cash flow  if the collateral dependent or repayment credit originates from  collateral or collateral takeover  is most likely to occur and is supported by a legal agreement on  increasing collateral.
In determining  the value of collateral, BRI uses a lower value between the value of  collateral binding with fair value  or market value of collateral.
Reevaluation of fair value or market  value of collateral is conducted  periodically.
BRI has in place the procedures to ensure the execution  of collateral, collateral or credit  insurance is carried out at a fair value.
The detailed methodologies  used to compute Allowance for  Impairment Losses are elaborated in the Risk Management chapter.

Hedging transactions observe the following principles: 1.
A transaction may be exercised as an alternative of the follow-up and risk mitigation options in the event that the  moderate limit of Market Risk Profile parameter is exceeded 2.
A transaction may be exercised when there are indications of macroeconomic changes that may result in losses,  among others the trend of market variable changes namely interest rate and exchange rate. 3.
BRI is not allowed to maintain a position over hedging transactions performed by related parties. 4.
BRI shall pass-on the transactions of a related party at the same time and in the same amount simultaneously to other banks that are not related parties.
Hedging Transaction Techniques Hedging transactions may be done as macro hedging and micro hedging.
•	Macro Hedging This technique is used to mitigate the impacts of economy risk to BRI’s entire portfolio.
Macro hedging is proposed  by the Treasury Division and decided by ALCO.
•	Micro HedgingFinancial Review PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Annual Report 2019291 Performance Highlights Management Reports Company Profile Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social Responsibility Consolidated Financial Statements 2019Micro hedging may be done on individual transaction.

The system was established with the aim to (i) ensure  the conformity of employee’s performance with the Company’s performance, (ii) encourage, motivate,  and direct the employee to continuously improve  their performances, (iii) realize clear relations between performance plan achievement with employee’s  career development (position promotion), and (iv) a  performance assessment result serves as one of the factors that influence the stipulation of compensation  and benefits, as well as determination of employee’s  talent class.
To develop performance driven culture in the Company,  BRI sharpens its performance assessment aspect, by among other content standardization on Objective Performance Target for Unit Heads, employees with  structural positions, and marketing officers.
Automation  and monitoring of KPI target achievements on marketing officers were carried out with quarterly performance  appraisal cycle.
BRI consistently standardized the KPI  contents for all positions in the Company (except for staffs and administrative officers), which aimed at  sharpening the objectivity and maintain the fairness of  performance appraisal.
Prior to Objective Performance Target and 360o  competency review, the value of Competency Target is initially collected and locked.
This is aimed to ensure  that performance appraisal is carried out not only from  1 vertical direction of supervisors to staffs, but also between fellow employees and staffs.
BRI sets the KPI in the Performance Management  System (MIS) by integrating the Company’s targets to  all of its employees, hence aligning both Individual  and the Company’s KPIs.
As such, competence-based  performance appraisal is expected to deliver objective  and fair results.
Employee’s remuneration structure is designed based on several factors, such as performance assessment,  competency, and the level of living costs in each  geographical Work Unit to ensure a fair, competitive system, and according to the needs and capabilities of  the Company.
Types of Compensation and Benefits •	Fixed compensation, consisting of Basic Salaries and  Benefits.
•	Variable compensation given to employees based  on performance achievements.
•	To provide a sense of security and convenience  at work, BRI provides benefits to employees.
The  benefits are provided during the tenure, such as  health care programs or those received after the end of employment such as pension programs, as  well as other facilities commonly provided by similar  companies in the banking industry.
•	To improve employee’s engagement and sense of  belonging to the Company and provide long-term  motivation/incentives to the employee to achieve the Company’s performance targets, BRI provides the Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP) to  its employees in 2019 in the form of Share Bonus  phase 1.
Employees entitled for a share allocation are permanent employee with certain performance.
The grant date is determined on 23 and 24 May  2019.
Increase in Compensation BRI applies a merit increase strategy for employee’s  compensation.
This means that employee with excellent  performance will get higher compensation.
Or arguably  the increase in salaries is directly proportional to the employee’s performance.
In 2019, BRI also adjusted the amount of salary  compensation and formulas for performance benefits  that was more challenging than in previous years,  especially for marketing officers who work as the spearheads of the Company.
