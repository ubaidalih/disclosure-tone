112 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkFinancial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY REVIEW Global Economic Analysis National Economic Analysis2020 is a year full of challenges for all economic  and business players in the world as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Its spread is fast and massive, almost no country is free from the virus which has claimed many lives.
In dealing with these conditions, various countries have taken policies to prioritize the health and safety aspects of their citizens by carrying out lockdowns, either at the city or state level.
The lockdown policy had a major impact on the  economic performance of various countries due to almost halted economic and community activity.
This is reflected in the economic growth of most countries in the world which experienced negative growth in the first and second quarters of 2020.
Many countries experienced recession, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Italy which are developed countries.
Moreover, the relationship between the United States and China were heating up, which had an impact on the world economy, considering that the two countries had a major influence in the global economy.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its World  Economic Outlook report released in January 2021, predicts global economic growth in 2020 of -3.5%.
However, the IMF sees that the performance of the global economy begins to show improvement in the third quarter of 2020 as policies from various countries have reopened access to entry and exit of their countries and relaxed economic and community activities despite having to implement health protocols.
In 2021, the IMF predicts that the global economy will experience positive growth again with a growth of 5.5%.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also become a major challenge for the Indonesian economy in 2020.
The Corona virus has spread rapidly throughout Indonesia.
Since the President announced the first confirmed positive case of COVID-19 in Depok, West Java in early March 2020, until the end of 2020, no less than 740 thousand people have been confirmed positive with more than 22 thousand numbers of death, which still continue growing until now.
The government has paid great attention to the  impact of this pandemic where the safety of citizens became the main focus.
One of the actions taken was issuing of Government Regulation in lieu of Law No. 1/2020 about National Financial Policy and Financial System Stability to Handle the COVID-19 Pandemic and/or In the Interest of Responding to Threats Endangering the National Economic and/or the Financial System Stability (Perppu 1/2020).
This was then ratified as Law No. 2/2020.
With this regulation the government could reallocate the budget to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In line with the steps taken by the Central Government,  the Regional Government has also established various policies to break the chain of the spread of COVID-19, one of which is by implementing a Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy, although this policy is less popular from an economic perspective.
The government has also provided various economic  stimuli, both in the form of cash and non-cash assistance, especially for the poor and affected by this pandemic as part of efforts to save the national economy in preventing a recession.
Bank Indonesia (BI) has also issued an  accommodative policy by lowering the BI 7 days  113 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkManagement Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Financial Statements Good Corporate Governance Corporate Social Responsibility repo rate.
Throughout 2020, BI was recorded to  have lowered the BI 7 days repo rate by 5 (five) times (until December 2020) from 5.00% to 3.75%.
Through these various countermeasures, the  realization of Indonesia’s economic growth in 2020 was recorded at -2.07%, lower than the previous year’s economic growth of 5.02%.
Meanwhile, inflation in 2020 reached 1.68%, indicating a decline in people’s purchasing power in line with the declining economic growth in 2020.
In the midst of a pandemic and a declining economy, Indonesia’s trade balance experienced a surplus, mainly due to declining import values.
The Government and Bank Indonesia (BI) were also able to maintain exchange rate stability, particularly the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar.
With this condition, the government was confident  that Indonesia will return to growth in 2021, whereby the Central Bank is predicting a 4.3%-5.3% growth.
This confidence is based on the improving economic sentiment between Q3 to the end of 2020.
National Cement Industry Analysis The pandemic also became the main challenge for the country’s cement industry.
Demand for cement products decreased compared to the previous year due to the decline in people’s purchasing power.
Moreover, most of the property and infrastructure projects, both developed by the Government and the private sector, experienced delays.
Based on data from the Indonesian Cement  Association (ASI), cement industry sales volume in 2020 only reached 72.0 million tons, down 5.4% compared to the previous year’s sales of 76.1 million tons.
Domestic sales decreased 10.2% to 62.7 million tonnes, while export sales increased 47.62% to 9.3 million tonnes.
Of this amount, the largest decrease came from the type of bulk cement, which in 2020 fell 23.4%, while bag cement only decreased by 4.2%.
Meanwhile, the supply of cement in the market  has increased with the operation of a new cement factory in Jember, East Java.
This resulted in an increase in the national cement supply capacity by 2.7% to 115.3 million tonnes.
The increase in supply capacity and the decline in national cement demand resulted in increased oversupply of cement in the market.
Based on ASI data, oversupply in the cement market in 2020 increased to 43.3 million tons, or an increase of 19.61% compared to 2019.
Below is the table of Capacity Development,  Domestic Demand and Average Utilization 2019-2020 is as follows: Description Unit 2020 2019 Installed Capacity Million tonnes 115.3 112.3 Domestic Demand Million tonnes 62.7 69.8 Export Sales Million tonnes 9.3 6.3 Total Sales of the National Cement Industry Million tonnes 72.0 76.1 Utilization % 64.1* 67.4 *  Using an installed capacity of 112.3 million tonnes (excluding the capacity of a new cement plant in Jember,  where the sales volume was not recordedin the Indonesian Cement Association data). 114 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkFinancial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile SIG is the most dominant player in the national  cement industry.

This strategy is also suitable to accommodate conditions in 2020 where the community must carry out physical distancing to avoid transmission of COVID-19.
The company has built several digital marketing  platforms for customers and business partners of SIG.
SIG develops the SobatBangun platform, which is supported by various services of architects, contractors, and financial services to provide comprehensive solutions for customers in building their properties.
The Company also developed the AksesToko platform which is intended for distributors and retail stores that distribute SIG products where retail stores can place orders for goods online and also take advantage of using the financial services offered which provide easy transactions for its users.
In addition, the Company also opened an official  online store in the online marketplace as a solution for customers wanting to purchase SIG products without the trouble of having to visit a building materials shop especially during the pandemic.
Digital MarketingMarketing Aspect The cement industry went through considerable challenges in 2020.
Demand for cement products plummeted along with the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the other hand, cement supply in the market went up along with a new entrant which started to operate in 2020 and has caused an increase in cement oversupply in the market.
For SIG, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a threat that bring negative impact to cement demand and increase the competition intensity, it also become a catalyst for the Company to accelerate varios innovation to win the competition.
SIG applied a comprehensive marketing strategy to  adapt, among others:  The pandemic has caused a decline in demand for cement products and construction materials.
This has intensified the competition among industry players.
To improve its competitive advantage, SIG had to be more cost efficient.
to conduct cost efficiency, where in the context of marketing and supply chain, efficiency could be done by reducing marketing and distribution cost.
In 2020, SIG has implemented a new business  model in distribution and sales by implementing a single distributor or mega distributor scheme.
In this business model, SIG (parent company) acts as the sole distributor that will market and distribute all SIG products (which are not limited to cement products only) through the established SIG distribution network throughout Indonesia.
Through this model, the Company gains efficiency  through transaction costs in addition to distributor operations which are also simpler and more efficient.
On the other hand, this mega distributor model provide convenience in marketing and selling SIG product portfolio whereby customers can purchase various products and brands of the Company by only transacting with one party.
Mega Distributor 117 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkManagement Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Financial Statements Good Corporate Governance Corporate Social Responsibility In response to the decline in domestic demand  during the pandemic, the Company continued its efforts to increase export sales.
Such approach was also taken to ensure that the utilization of production facilities can be maintained as part of a capacity management strategy and in order to strengthen the position of SIG as the largest cement player in Southeast Asia.
The Company continues to increase access to new markets for export, such as Myanmar, Brunei Darussalam and Taiwan.
In addition, GIS also continues to maintain its established markets such as Australia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China and several other countries.
To support an increase in the export market, the  Company has made enhancements at several ports to increase loading rates to increase supply capability in the regional market.
The Company continues to encourage product innovation development to expand its market.
Product innovation development is also tailored to customer needs.
In 2020, the Company introduced various types of cement that can be tailored to the type of building / construction and customer needs, one of which is Dynamix Masonry, which is a type of cement suitable for non-structural construction work at a more economical price.
The development of innovative products aims to strengthen the position of GIS as a provider of building materials solutions that are able to offer a complete product portfolio for various applications, so that customers can find products that are more accurate and suit their needs at more competitive prices.
More than 50% of the total national cement consumption in 2020 still came from Java, but the portion was decreasing compared to 2019 because Java has been the center of the COVID-19 pandemic with the highest number of cases compared to other regions.
With production and distribution facilities spread across all regions in Indonesia, the Company was still able to maintain its leadership in the market by dominating more than 50% of the national cement market.
Strengthening Export Market Product Innovation Marketing Communications Market ShareIn supporting the marketing strategy, the Company  actively carries out marketing communications.
Since 2019, SIG has implemented an integrated marketing communication strategy, in which the Company carries out more local communications to strengthen the position of a brand.
The marketing communication program plays a role in maintaining the continuity of interactions between principals and consumers in an effort to form, expand and increase awareness.

Such decline was not only related to lower production volumes due to lower domestic demand for cement and building materials, but also a result of the Company’s efficiency and Operational Excellence initiatives.
The Company was able to achieve a greater decrease in cost of revenue than the decrease in revenue.
This was shown by the achievement of the cost of goods sold per tonne in 2020 amounting to Rp591.10 thousand, which was lower than 2019 amounting to Rp638.96 thousand, or a decrease of 7.49%.
In addition, the cost of revenue ratio in 2020 decreased to 66.97% from 68.50% in the previous year.
Below are various efforts made by the Company  to manage cost of revenue as part of the cost transformation implementation.
• Raw Material CostsRaw material costs in 2020 were IDR 1,628 billion, down 13.13% from 2019 amounting to IDR 1,874 billion.
This decline is in line with a decrease in the Company’s production volume and is supported by several raw material management initiatives, including:•  Optimization of  raw materials from the most efficient sources.
•  Optimizing the use of the most efficient material and composition •  Optimizing the use of recycled materials • Optimizing the use of waste from other industries.
• Cost of EnergyAbsolute Energy Costs in 2020 amounted to Rp7,818 billion, decreased by 13.09% from 2019 amounting to Rp8,996 billion in line with the decline in production volume in 2020 and energy costs / tonnes of sales which decreased by 5.61% due to a decrease coal prices as well as various cost transformation efforts made for energy costs, including: • Reducing the coal consumption figure/ coal consumption index and fuel consumption In billion Rupiah Cost of Revenue 2020 2019Growth (Decline) Rp % Raw Materials Used 1,628 1,874 (246) (13.13%) Labor 2,228 2,254 (26) (1.15%) Manufacturing Overhead        Fuel and Energy 7,818 8,996 (1,178) (13.09%)   Depreciation and Amortization 2,781 1,956 825 42.18%   Others 9,367 12,711 (3,344) (26.31%) Total Manufacturing Cost 23,822 27,791 (3,969) (14.28%) Work-in-Progress Inventory        At the beginning of the year 693 689 4 0.58%   Purchases - 42 (42) (100.00%)   At the end of the year (735) (693) 42 6.06% Cost of Goods Manufactured 23,780 27,829 (4,049) (14.55%) Finished Goods Inventory        At the beginning of the year 776 596 180 30.20%   Purchases 0 5 (5) (100.00%)   At the end of the year (1,001) (776) (225) (28.99%) Total 23,555 27,654 (4,099) (14.82%) 130 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkFinancial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile Gross Profit At the end of 2020, the Company’s gross profit  was recorded at Rp11,617 billion, an 8.63% decline compared to the previous year, which amounted to Rp12,714 billion.
The decline in gross profit was a consequence of the decline in domestic demand for cement and building materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the Company’s gross profit margin was maintained with a 1.53% increase in gross profit margin to 33.03% from 31.50% in 2019 as a result of the Company’s efforts to manage the declining rate of cost of revenue to be lower than the decline in revenue with the various Operational Excellence initiatives described above.

• Evaluating coal purchases by prioritizing large contracts and based on the proximity of the mine location to production facilities in order to get the best price and the most efficient freight costs.
The goal is to reduce energy costs per tonne of clinker.
•  Optimization and centralization of industrial oil purchases to obtain competitive prices.
• Optimization of the electricity consumption index, especially for equipments that consume large power  while maintaining the best performance in each equipment.
• Optimizing the utilization of SIG power plants and WHRPG facilities.
• Other Manufacturing OverheadOther manufacturing overhead in 2020 were Rp9,367 billion, down 26.31% from 2019 amounting to Rp12,711 billion.
Costs included in  other manufacturing overhead are distribution cost, packaging cost, maintenance cost, general & administrative cost, taxes and insurance cost, and others.
The decrease in other manufacturing overhead was not only impacted by lower production and sales volumes, but also due to:• The decrease in distribution costs, in line with the decrease in the Company’s sales volume and production volume in 2020 which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The reduction in distribution cost also came from the synergy and integration of supply chain management post acquisition of PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk and the implementation of cost transformation initiatives, including:• Maximizing the supply chain management by integrating the Company’s distribution facilities.
• Integrating distribution and transportation procurement contract and renegotiation.
• Evaluation of carrier vessel contracts to obtain optimal freight routes and rates.
•  Optimization and utilization of vessels by synergizing in order to increase the value of transport cost efficiency •  Optimization of land transportation modes by selecting the type of transportation and distribution patterns.
•  In addition, there was a decrease in distribution costs as a result of the implementation of PSAK 73 “leases”, so that it was reclassified to depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense.
• The decline in expenses related to the Transitional Service and License Agreement (TSLA) between SBI and Holcim Service (South Asia) Limited and Holcim Technology Ltd for one-year period ended on 31 January 2020.
• The continuous efforts for efficiency include:• Efficiency in maintenance cost index and reducing job patches.
• Centralization of outsourcing and material management.
• Optimization of heavy equipment procurement with more effective and efficient patterns.
• Increasing the use of local and alternative spare parts and substituting into more competitive lubricants.

Selling expenses decreased by 9.11% as compared to 2019, mainly due to lower transportation and handling expenses in line with the decrease in sales volume.
General & administrative expenses also went down by 10.60% due to lower TSLA costs with Holcim Service (South Asia) Limited and Holcim Technology Ltd that ended on 31 January 2020.
This decrease was also a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of health protocols, where most of the Group’s administrative activities had to be carried out on a Work from Home (WFH) basis, thereby reducing the burden on office needs, entertainment, business trips, as well as expenses for education, training and development that were conducted virtually.

The decline in operational profit was caused by a decrease in sales volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the Company was able to maintain efficiency and Operational Excellence resulting an increase in operating profit margin from 15.32% in 2019 to 16.06% in 2020.
The Company also managed to record an increase in EBITDA, both in absolute terms and in EBITDA margin.
Absolute EBITDA went up 4.30% to Rp9,073 billion compared to 2019, while the EBITDA margin increased to be 25.80% from the previous year of 21.55%.
The improvement in EBITDA and EBITDA margin were mainly derived from various efficiency and Operational Excellence efforts carried out in 2020, lower fuel and distribution costs, the completion of the TSLA contract in January 2020, and the implementation of PSAK 73 “lease”. 132 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkFinancial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile Profit for the Year Attributable to Owners of the Parent Entity Comprehensive Income for the Year In 2020, the Company recorded a comprehensive income for the year of Rp2,317 billion, an increase of 2.16%  compared to the previous year amounted to Rp2,268 billion.
Despite the challenges in 2020, the Company successfully recorded an increase in profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity of 16.72% to be Rp2,792 billion, compared to the previous year which amounted to Rp2.392 billion.
The increase in profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity also improved the Company’s gross profit margin from 5.93% in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020.
Profit per Share In line with the increase in profit for the year 2020, earnings per share of the Company also went up by 16.87% from Rp403 in 2019 to Rp471 in 2020.
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows SIG’s financial expenditure in 2020 experienced a significant decrease of Rp884 billion, from 2019’s Rp3,205 billion to Rp2,321 billion in 2020.
The decline was the result of loan refinancing in May and July 2019 for competitive interest rates, settlement of bank loans throughout 2020 –both on-schedule and accelerated– as well as a reduction in the loan reference interest rate (JIBOR) in 2020.

This increase was mainly derived from a strict cash flow management and the Company’s efforts to maintain liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic by managing more optimum cash cycle.
Total net cash flows used for investing activities in 2020 reached Rp2,251 billion, a lower than to the previous year’s amount of Rp17,161 billion.
Such decrease was due to the capital expenditure (CAPEX) activities in 2020 which were mostly dedicated to maintain the daily operations (selective CAPEX), while 2019’s capex spending were much higher, especially due to the acquisition of PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk (formerly PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk).
Throughout 2020, there were short-term investment  made in the form of time deposits in banks amounting to Rp1,036 billion, and procurement of fixed assets at Rp1,280 billion.
Cash Flow for Investment Activities   Cash Flows from (for) Financing Activities In 2020, SIG recorded a net cash flow for financing  activities of of Rp6,003 billion.
Throughout 2020, on a net basis, the Company has made debt payments, both short and long-term, as well as disbursing Rp5,384 billion of temporary syirkah funds.
This amount was higher than the debt amount that actually due in 2020 according to the repayment schedule.
With the decrease in the amount of interest bearing debt and a lower floating interest rate which refer to JIBOR, the Company was able to reduce its financial cost in 2020.
On the contrary  to the previous year, the Company recorded a net cash flow of Rp10,285 billion from financing activities used to fund the acquisition of PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk (formerly PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk).
SIG is committed in ensuring the payment of its debt which is shown by paying the principal and interest in a timely manner.
The Company continues to make efforts to manage liquidity and monitor the maturity date of the loan principal and interest payments.
The Company’s ability in fulfilling all debts, both long and short term, is measured by several ratios such as liquidity ratios and solvency ratios.
The liquidity ratio is used to measure the ability to pay off short-term obligations, while the solvency ratio is used to measure the ability to meet all the Company’s debts.
Debt Repayment Capability and Debt Collectability 134 Annual Report 2020    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkFinancial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile The Company’s ability to fulfill short-term debts was  measured through the current ratio, calculated by dividing current assets with current liabilities.
In 2020, the Company’s current ratio was 135.27% which was lower compared to the previois year of 136.10% The solvency ratio shows the Company’s ability to meet its liabilities, both short and long term, which is indicated by measuring the interest bearing liabilities on equity, on capital and on total assets.
In 2020, the interest bearing liabilities/equity ratio decrease to 75.31%, the interest bearing liabilities/capital ratio decrease to 42.96% and the interest bearing liabilities/total assets ratio also decrease to 32.99%.
The decrease in these ratios was due to the debt repayment conducted by the Company throughout 2020.
Collectability of Receivables is measured using Average Collection Period (ACP) by comparing the average account receivables with revenue times the number of days in a year (365 days).
In 2020, the ACP was 63 days, or longer than  previous year of 55 days.
The longer ACP in 2020 was mainly derived from the extension of the Term of Payment which was selectively given to several distributors and projects significantly affected by COVID-19.
On the other hand, SIG experienced better cash cycle by managing the average payables turnover by optimizing the utilization of the Supplier Financing facility so that vendors could adjust the their payment terms with a competitive cost of funds.

Indonesia has a very large potential for cement demand since it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a population of around 270 million, most of whom are in the productive age group.
Meanwhile, cement consumption per capita in Indonesia is still quite low compared to most other Asian countries.
Based on the census conducted in 2015, Indonesia  had 11.4 million housing backlogs that have been addressed by the government through various affordable housing programs (source: ppdpp.
The government infrastructure budget also has a  major influence on cement demand, especially from the bulk side.
The Government infrastructure budget has increased by more than 150% in the 5 years period of 2015-2019 compared to the 5 years period of 2010-2014.
The growth in bulk demand was much higher than the growth in bag demand, and the bulk portion in national cement consumption has increased from 22% in 2014 to 27% in 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economy  and national cement demand, including demand from infrastructure projects in 2020.
By 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine program is expected to increase public and business confidence.
The government has also increased the infrastructure budget to Rp387.4 trillion to boost the economy because infrastructure has a large multiplier effect on economic growth which is expected to have a positive impact on cement demand.
