The lock down policies  resulted in restricted mobility in a global scale, which led to  declining consumption, stoppage of production processes,  reduction of international trade and, eventually, contraction  of the global economy.
A number of international organizations have predicted a  contraction of global economic growth in 2020 of -5.2%  to -3.7% yoy.
While the Covid-19 pandemic has yet to  end, many countries in the world have begun to cautiously  move the wheels of economic activities, while some  others remained in a lock down in order to better protect BNI has compiled an implementation  timeline for various strategic initiatives over the next five years into the 2019-2023 Corporate Plan.

The positive growth of the economy was the result of  a strict policy of total lockdown in the epicenter of the  pandemic, fiscal stimulus package for China’s domestic  industries, and effective social assistance program for  citizens impacted by the pandemic.
In 2021, China’s  economy is predicted to rebound to a growth of 8.2%  (yoy) on the strength returning manufacturing activities,  people mobility, and increasing global demand for China’s  products.

Indonesia’s economic growth for  2019 was 5.02%, while in 2020 was -2.07% (BPS, 2021).
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic was followed by  a lockdown policy of various forms in many countries of  the world, and called the Large-Scale Social Restriction  (PSBB) policy in Indonesia, which restricted the mobility of  people and goods and led to the decline in consumption/ demand, production and investment.
Indonesia’s economic  slowdown has occurred since 2019 mainly as a result of  the trade war between the United States and China.

Nearing the end of the year 2020, the global economy has slowly begun to recover to its pre- pandemic levels, with activities conducted in observance  of health protocols.
In 2021, global economic growth is predicted to rebound  in a positive way and take the form of a “V-shape” at  the level of 4.2% -5.2% (yoy).
The improvement in the  global economy, among others, will be supported by the  vaccination drive that will be given globally starting in Q1- 2021 and is expected to be a game changer.
Vaccination is  expected to result in a herd immunity, making the global  community “immune” from Covid-19, returning global  mobility and encouraging global economic recovery.

In the Euro-Zone, weak performance in the tourism and  manufacturing sectors is predicted to result in 8.3%  (yoy) contraction of the economy in 2020.
The economic  contraction is exacerbated by lockdown policy taken in a number of Euro Zone countries, as well as the threat from  a new Covid-19 variant appearing in the UK near the end  of 2020.

Domestic demand in terms  of consumption and investment still remains as the  primary driver of national economic growth post-Covid-19  pandemic.
Implementation of the Omnibus Law on Job  Creation is expected to attract more overseas investors  to invest their capital in Indonesia.
Government spending  is directed towards supporting the momentum of growth,  continuing with the countercyclical policy, and accelerating  the PEN program post-Covid-19.
Exports are predicted  to improve in line with the recovery of global economies,  as well as efforts by the Government in expanding the  potential export destination countries and in developing the  tourism sector.
Indonesia’s economy is expected to rebound in 2021, with  the IMF predicting an economic growth of 4.8% (yoy).
The availability of the Covid-19 vaccine raises hopes for  an increasingly significant economic recovery.
On the  other hand, the application of the Omnibus Law on the  Job Creation Law since it was passed in November 2020  is also expected to have an impact on the attractiveness  of investment that also encourages Indonesia’s economic  growth.
Inflation level throughout 2020 tended to decline compared  with those in 2019 as consumer purchases weakened  due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The pandemic, and the  social restrictions that follow, have resulted in a weakening  of consumer demand as well as purchasing power.
Certain inflation-forming components, such as volatile  foodstuffs and goods, contributed significantly to the  decline in inflation throughout 2020.
The low inflation rates throughout 2020 was mainly driven by inflation in several  expenditure groups, such as the food and beverage,  transportation, information and communications, housing,  water and electricity, as well as personal care and other  services.
Inflation in 2021 is estimated to remain at the 3%  - 4% level.
Observing economic developments in 2020, Bank  Indonesia has lowered its benchmark interest rates, the  BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRRR), by 125 bps or  5 times to 3.75%.
Reductions were made in February,  March, June, July, and November 2020, respectively, each  of 25 bps.
This decision is consistent with the forecast for inflation to remain low and external stability that is maintained to promote economic recovery during the  Covid-19 pandemic.
Meanwhile, in April, May, August,  September, October and December 2020, Bank Indonesia  continued to maintain the BI7DRRR with the consideration  of maintaining external stability, amidst the predicted  low inflation rate.
Until 2021, Bank Indonesia is expected  to maintain low interest rates until there are signs of  increasing inflationary pressure.
In 2021, the BI7DRRR is  estimated to be in the 3.75% - 4% range.
The profusion of fiscal stimulus in the developed  economies in 2021 will tend to strengthen the Rupiah  against the US Dollar.
In 2020, the Rupiah was under  significant pressure, as sentiments of the weakening  effect of Covid-19 pandemic on Indonesia’s economy  drove foreign investors sell off their holdings in Indonesia  and place them in safe haven assets.
In 2021, a number of developed countries such as Japan  and the US have stated that they will provide a jumbo  stimulus package.
The US Government and Senate have  agreed on a 2021 stimulus package worth US$900 billion.
The Japanese Government has also launched a stimulus  package totaling 73.6 trillion Yen or US$708 billion.
The  Central Bank of Japan said it would buy securities from  the market indefinitely.
The Fed has repeatedly stated  the need for stimulus and it is likely that the White House  will approve of the Fed proposal that President Trump  previously ignored.
From Europe, the EU Central Bank  has approved the purchase of securities from the market  worth Rp3,080 trillion until 2022.
At the same time, the  development of the Covid-19 vaccine will be closer to  certainty.
Therefore, it is estimated that capital inflow will  again enter the Emerging Market, including Indonesia, so that the Rupiah exchange rate will be better in 2021.
In  2021, the Rupiah exchange rate will move in the range of  Rp13,500-14,500 per US Dollar.
Vaccination will be a Game Changer for economic recovery,  as vaccination is hoped to lead to the so-called herd  immunity.
With communities being  “immune” from  Covid-19, global mobility can return to normal and thus  encourage the recovery of economic activities.
Review of the Economy and Banking Industry Management   Discussion & Analysis 167 Uniting Energy to Revive the Country2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) TbkbankInG IndusTR y oveR vIeW  During the Covid-19 Pandemic, growth in banks’ third- party funds (DPK) rose far higher than the growth in  banks’ loans.
LDR, NIM, ROA decreased while banking  NPL increased.
CAR is still maintained at the level of  24.25%.
Until November 2020, the growth of third party  funds (DPK) reached 11.5% (yoy), higher than the growth  in deposits a year earlier in the same period which was  only 6.72% (yoy).
On the other hand, loans disbursed  contracted by -1.39% (yoy), much lower than in November  2019, which grew by 7.05% (yoy).
The high growth in third party funds was influenced by  the increasing tendency to save the public to banks to  anticipate the risk of economic downturn, especially  for large bank groups.
In addition, the placement of  funds by the Government in the framework of the  National Economic Recovery (PEN) program has also  become a catalyst for the growth of third party funds in national banking.
Meanwhile, from the loan side, the  low demand for loan was influenced by the weakening  economy exposed to the Covid-19 pandemic, so that  business players chose not to expand (low loan demand)  accompanied by banking prudence in controlling non- performing loans.
As Indonesia’s economic recovery progresses in 2021, loan  growth is projected to improve, particularly consumption  loan and working capital loan, which are estimated to grow  5% -6% yoy.
This loan growth will be supported by third  party funds which are estimated to grow in the range of  7% -9% yoy in 2021.

Review of operational Performance overseas branch offices (kcln) kcln assets Total assets of the Overseas Branch Office (KCLN)  business	in	2020	is	shown	as	follow: description2020 2019 Growth (Rp million) (%) (Rp million) (%) (%) Total Loan 53,114,046 65.33 41,750,166 61.51 27.22 Other Assets 28,189,499 34.67 25,346,208 38.29 11.22 Total asset 81,303,545 100.00 67,096,374 100.00 21.17 In 2020, the loan portfolio of the KCLN business amounted to Rp53.1 trillion,  or a growth of 27.2% compared to 2019.
This growth is also in line with KCLN’s strategy which  focuses on financing Indonesian-Related Businesses as  a form of KCLN’s efforts to support company expansion.
Indonesia in global transactions.
This was reflected in  the increase in growth in KCLN’s local loans with an  achievement of Rp24.44 trillion or a growth of 14.6%  (YoY) compared to the previous year.
This reflects that  KCLN has succeeded in becoming an extension of BNI in  accommodating the business needs of local companies  that have business dealings with Indonesian companies.
Among the key success factors of the performance growth  in 2020 is the successful efforts by the KCLN in mitigating  the risk of economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19  pandemic, namely by the early classification of business  risks affected by Covid-19 and then being selective in  providing financing, while simultaneously conducting  stress tests on these risks.
kcln Third Party Funds (dPk) The balance of DPK of KCLN in 2020 is mostly contributed by the issuance of Certificate of Deposit to local loan and  local trade customers of KCLN, as well as from banking  accounts of the respective Indonesian embassy or  consulate at the KCLN.  204 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the CountryThird	Party	Funds	(DPK)	collected	by	the	KCLN	in	2020	is	shown	as	follow: Total Third Party Funds of overseas branch office description2020 2019 Growth (Rp million) (%) (Rp million) (%) (%) Saving Account 120,444 1.41 99,494 3.96 21.06 Current Account 2,498,001 29.35 1,751,398 69.68 42.63 Time Deposit 5,893,774 69.24 662,713 26.37 789.34 Total 8,512,219 100.00 2,513,605 100.00 238.65 During 2020, total DPK at KCLN was recorded at Rp8.5 trillion, growing by 238% compared to the previous year.
This  increase was mainly contributed by the success of KCLN New York in gaining market confidence in issuing Certificate of  Deposit (CD) as an effort for KCLN to obtain low-cost funds.
Revenues of overseas branch offices (kcln) Through a business focus on customers or Indonesian companies that have expanded, or planning to expand, their  business overseas, the KCLN strives to optimize on potential business/transactions that generate fee-based income.
Revenues	of	the	KCLN	in	2020	is	shown	as	follow: overseas branch office Revenue description2020 2019 Growth (Rp million) (%) (Rp million) (%) (%) Net Interest Income 1,741,547 69.50 1,046,260 67.47 39.92 Fee Based Income 764,277 30.50 504,538 32.53 33.98 net operating Income 2,505,824 100.00 1,521,392 100.00 38.11 Fee-based income at the KCLN in 2020 was contributed by fees on loans, trade activities, remittances and securities gains.
In 2020, the performance of net operating income registered an increase of 38.11% YoY from the 2019 achievement, or  reached Rp955 billion.
International banking domestic services  Revenues of International banking domestic services are derived from trade, remittances, Financial Institution, and  International Desk.

The largest contribution to the decline in revenues from international banking domestic services are revenues from the  Financial Institution business, which fell by 58.2% yoy.
This decline was the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic which caused  banks to tend to be careful in providing credit, so that a lot of funds became idle.
The decline in lending affected the BNI  Financial Institution business where demand for financing from BNI correspondent banks also decreased.
In addition, the  pandemic has also resulted in a decline in global oil consumption which has an impact on oil and gas investment projects.
Operational Review Management   Discussion & Analysis 205 Uniting Energy to Revive the Country2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) TbkThe Trade Finance business is able to maintain its  best performance and contribution to BNI’s profit.
This  was reflected in the realization of Trade Finance’s fee- based income in 2020 which was still able to grow by  8.91% (yoy) and Trade Finance’s interest income which  grew by 9.16% (yoy).
There are a number of strategies  implemented to support the achievement of Trade Finance  performance	during	2020,	including	the	following: 1.
Focus on working on domestic trade transactions in  anticipation of a decrease in export-import transactions  due to the weakening global supply chain which was  significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic 2.
Development of digital-based Trade Finance services through BNI Trade Online as a branchless & paperless  service solution. 3.
Provision of Trade Finance custom-tailored solutions in products and services that are capable of providing  added value as a solution to customers’ business needs according to a variety of industries, in order to  retain existing customers as well as new customer  acquisitions. 4.
Optimizing the utilization of Trade Facility by customers, with an offering that suits their needs for a  more dynamic market. 5.
Simplification of the trade finance transaction scheme in BNI in order to improve transaction and process  efficiency.
International segment strategy in 2020 The International division, through its vision of becoming a major player in the international trade and international  payment business for the banking industry in Indonesia,  continues to support BNI’s business through the  implementation of various strategies during 2020.
The entire KCLN network is located in business and  economic centers of the world, such as in Singapore, Hong  Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, London and New York, as well as 1  (one) Representative Office in Yangon representing the  Indochina region.
One of the keys to the success of the international  segment is to focus and be selective in managing assets  by	controlling	business	risk	through,	among	others: 1.
Focus on Indonesia Related businesses, particularly in  supporting the Value Chain of Indonesian companies’  businesses abroad and providing superior global services on a digital basis.
This business focus has  succeeded in improving; a.
Supervision of business activities.
Domestic trade business growth.
Encouraging expansion of local loans at each  KCLN.
The delay in investing in the oil and gas sector has affected the international business, which is reflected in the  decrease in transactions of Bank Guarantees issued on the  basis of guarantees from banks abroad.
Apart from the decline in the Financial Institution business,  the remittance business was also affected by the Covid-19  pandemic.
Revenues from the Remittance business  decreased by 7.6% compared to 2019, however, if  seen from the perspective of the number of remittance  transaction slips, it tends to be stable (decreased by 0.36%  compared to last year).
This condition is supported by  strategies implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, including:	 •	 Focus	on	Indonesian	Migrant	Workers	(PMI)	as	the	 largest contributor to remittance transaction slips.
In addition to income/fees from PMI remittance  transactions, BNI also succeeded in improving the  performance of opening PMI savings accounts by  41% and PMI’s Third Party Funds (DPK) by 36%,  compared to the achievements at the end of 2019.
•	 Significant	growth	in	transactions	from	countries	 implementing digital transactions, including South  Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
Among a number of digital breakthroughs by BNI were  the addition of the International Remittance feature to BNI  Mobile Banking, increased utilization of BNI MoRe (Mobile  Remittance) in Singapore, and increased remittance  cooperation with mobile apps partners in South Korea and Taiwan.
This is very helpful for customer remittance  transactions, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic  where customers do not need to come to BNI outlets  or BNI remittance partners to conduct  money transfer  transactions.
Amid the slowing pace of global and domestic economic  growth, the International Desk business and the Trade  Finance business were still able to record positive  performance and growth.
This is reflected in the growth of  third party funds and loans disbursed by the International  Desk which has increased quite rapidly.
On a yoy basis,  third party funds managed by the International Desk  experienced a growth of 25.6%, while loans disbursement  grew by 33.2% (yoy).
This growth contributed to the  increase in income received in the form of interest income  and fee income, which grew by 45.8% compared to 2019.
This performance was the contribution of the International  Desk, formerly known as the Japan Desk, established  by  BNI since 2012.
The Japan Desk has collaborated with  54 Japan Regional Banks (JRB) through the placement of  JRB trainees at BNI,  to help provide referrals for affiliated  companies in Indonesia where their parent company in  Japan has become a customer or debtor of the JRB.  206 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the Country2.

Optimization of digital banking services, especially in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, where the majority  of people reduce their activities outside the home.
One of them is in the Digital Remittance Service  (MoRe and OTR Cash Car) to maintain the penetration  of the remittance business in 2020.
This is evidenced by the success of KCLN in recording a  growth of 78.8% (YoY) in net profits in 2020, following  the successful implementation of strategies to mitigate business risks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic globally,  as well as the strategy in managing securities transactions.

Total BNI Remittance assets in 2020 amounted to 11,804 million, reaching 299.89% of the 2020 target Rp 3,936 million.
Total remittance transactions during 2020 were recorded at 270.7 thousand slips or decreased by 41% compared to the  previous year of 303.4 thousand slips.
The decrease in transactions was more due to changes in customer transaction  patterns who began to switch to using BNI Mobile Banking where there was a significant increase in the number of PMIs  opening accounts in 2020 with an average monthly account opening of 1,200 accounts and 80% of them activated BNI.
Transactions using BNI Mobile Banking were an option during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the Hong  Kong government issued a ban on gathering regulations so that many PMIs prefer transactions from their respective  homes.
The 2020 performance was achieved by improving remittance services and opening BNI Taplus PMI accounts 2020.
The  expansion of the remittance network was carried out by strengthening the cooperation that has been established between  BNI and local Money Service Operators (MSO) which have wider network outlets.
With this collaboration, BNI remittance  services can be felt more evenly throughout Hong Kong.
Collaborations have been established with 5 local MSOs, namely  BEST Remittance, Uniforex, Fast Access Corporation Ltd.
, and Nice Star Corporation Ltd.
During 2020, BNI Remittance is also active in organizing various educational-based marketing programs, including a savings  balance improvement program, an ATM and Mobile Banking utilization increase program, and a customer gets customer  program through the digital BNI account opening application (E-Form).
Through the WE program with BNI, BNI Remittance actively initiates a capacity-building program for PMI in Hong Kong.
The enthusiasm of PMI to increase capacity, as well as to widen networks among migrant workers, banks and other related  parties can be seen from the large number of participants who attend each training held.
The training is carried out in two  stages, namely soft skills training in the form of entrepreneurial seminars and hard skills training in the form of skills practice  classes.
In 2020, this capacity-building program will be further strengthened by involving communities, one of which is the  Nahdlatul Ulama Hong Kong community, which is through the cooperation in issuing Hong Kong NU Membership Cards  based on BNI Debit Cards.

This is in line with the BNI brand communication in  2019, namely, Be BNI, Be Exponential, in which all of  the convenience and comprehensiveness that BNI digital  services bring, will provide an advantage in customers’  lives such as having more time for family, relatives or self- development.

maRkeTInG sTRa TeGy Achieving the business target throughout 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic was a tremendous challenge for  BNI Sales Team in marketing BNI products.

•	 Carrying	out	greeting,	delivering	market	updates	and	 product offerings through WA Blast.

In 2020, BNI’s commitment to remain consistent as a  Digital Financial Institution underwent a test.
On March  2, 2020, the first case of Covid-19 in Indonesia was  announced by President Joko Widodo himself.
As a follow-up, the government decided to impose PSBB  (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) in almost all cities in  Indonesia with the aim of preventing the Covid-19 virus  from spreading out.
This policy required people to perform  many activities from home, such as school, prayer, and  working.
The concept of social distancing was believed to be the effective way to mitigate the spread of this virus. 230 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the Country•	 Hosting	online	gatherings	with	developer	partners	 to maintain relationship with customers during the  pandemic.
•	 Enhancing	the	capabilities	of	the	BNI	Marketer	Team	 by providing selling skills training virtually.
In order to maximize the results from marketing aspects,  the marketing activities were focused on the wider  community through several digital platforms that have  been widely used by BNI.
One of them was the use  of BNI’s own organic social media, especially because  as of December 19, 2020, BNI’s social media accounts  already had 1,236,946 followers on Twitter account @ BNI; 370,725 followers on Instagram @bni46; and 362,567  fans on Facebook page ‘BNI’.

Public enthusiasm  for some of the new features of digital financial services abovementioned has received a very good response, as  can be seen from the numerous testimonies shared across  BNI social media accounts.

Apart from digital media, other platforms that were also  exploited to promote these features were offline media  such as through adlibs on Radio, ads on television,  billboard installation, advertising in print media and others.

It can be seen from BNI’s  initiatives, namely the #AntarkanSemangat Movement.
#AntarkanSemangat was a social movement that  aimed to provide a positive spirit and optimism called  #AntarkanSemangat.
This movement involved all BNI  employees, commonly referred to as BNI Hi-Movers,  as well as general public who wanted to show their  empathy, especially to medical workers.
It was carried out  by donating various needs of medical devices, groceries,  and food as a form of support for the medical workers.

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION Assets In 2020, BNI recorded a moderate 5.4% growth of total assets in line with the slower growth of assets in the national  banking sector, as the domestic economy declined due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year.
The  moderate growth in total assets mainly reflects the increase in loan outstanding (gross) by 5.3%, or higher than average  industry growth, from Rp556.8 trillion in 2019 to Rp586.2 trillion the following year.
Net loan outstanding grew by 0.4%  from Rp539.9 trillion to Rp542.0 trillion at the end of 2020.
The low growth of net loan outstanding reflects the additional  provision for loan impairment expected on the implementation of SFAS 71 in the amount of Rp12.9 trillion after taking into  account deferred taxes.
In line with BNI’s core business in loan disbursement, the loan outstanding account contributed  the bulk of total assets at 60.8% in 2020, compared with 63.8% in the previous year.
Other earning assets in the form of  government bonds contributed 10.2% to BNI’s total assets, and showed an increase of 11.9% from Rp81.0 trillion in 2019  to Rp90.7 trillion in 2020.

PRIME LENDING RATE   Based on the Regulation of the Financial Services Authority (POJK) No. 6/POJK.03/2015 concerning Transparency and  Publication of Bank Reports as amended by POJK No. 32/ POJK.03/2016 and Bank Indonesia Regulation Number  7/6/PBI/2005 concerning Transparency of Bank Product  Information and Use of Customer Personal Data (State  Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2005 Number  16, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of  Indonesia Number 4475), Commercial Banks who carry out  conventional business activities in Indonesia are required  to report and publish the Prime Lending Rate (SBDK) in  Rupiah.
The prime lending rate implementation aims to provide  clarity to customers and facilitate customers in weighing  the benefits, costs and credit risks offered by the Bank.
In addition, publication of prime lending rates are intended  to improve good governance and promote healthy  competition in the banking industry, among others, through  the creation of better market discipline.
In addition, the prime lending rate is used as an indicator  of the amount of loan interest rates that will be charged to  customers applying for credit to the Bank.
Therefore, BNI  constantly updates the prime lending rate in accordance with the movement of the reference interest rate set  by Bank Indonesia.
In general, the prime lending rate is  calculated based on 3 (three) components, namely the  Cost of Funds for Credit (HPDK) arising from customer  fundraising activities, operating expenses incurred for  fundraising and lending and the profit margin component  set by the Bank in lending activities.
The prime lending rate  calculation does not take into account the risk premium  component of the debtor, the amount of which depends  on the risk assessment of each debtor.
Thus, the amount  of credit interest rate charged to debtors is not necessarily  the same as the prime lending rate.
BNI is required to report the prime lending rate calculation  to Bank Indonesia on a monthly basis and periodically  publish in the wider media.
The prime lending rate  calculation applies to types of corporate credit, retail credit, micro credit, and consumption credit (KPR and non-KPR).
However, Bank Indonesia submitted the classification of  corporate credit, retail credit and consumer credit (KPR and  non-KPR) based on the internal criteria used by each bank.
The following is the prime lending rate information that has  been determined by BNI in 2020: Description Prime Lending Rate per year Based on Business Segments Corporation Credit (%)Retail Credit (%)Micro Credit (%)Consumer Credit KPR  (%)Non KPR  (%) Prime Lending Rate 9.80 9.80 - 10.00 11.70 260 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the CountryFINANCIAL RATIOS Financial Ratio  2020 2019 2018 (%) (%) (%) CAPITAL     CAR-Tier I 15.7  18.6 17.4 CAR-Tier II 1.1  1.1 1.1 CAR (Credit, Market and Operational Risk) 16.8  19.7 18.5 Asset Quality    NPL Nett 0.9  1.2 0.8 NPL Gross 4.3  2.3 1.9 Adequacy ratio of provision for losses to non-performing loans 182.4  133.5 152.9 Profitability    ROA 0.5  2.4 2.8 ROE 2.9  14.0 16.1 Net Interest Margin 4.5  4.9 5.3 Efficiency    BOPO 93.3  73.2 70.1 CIR 44.2  43.9 42.5 Liquidity     LDR 87.3  91.5 88.8 RIM 75.4 86.6 84.6 Compliance    GWM (Rupiah) 5.4  6.7 6.5 Net Open Position 3.2  2.4 2.0 BMPK Percentage of violation  0.0  0.0 0.0 BMPK Percentage of exceedance  0.0  0.0 0.0 Capital Ratio  Capital Adequacy Ratio The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) in 2020 declined to 16.8%  compared with 19.7% in 2019.
The decline in the Bank’s  CAR was attributable to a number of factors, including  the increase in loan outstanding on the other hand while  experiencing a decline in retained earnings due to the  decline in income for the year and additional provision on  implementation of SFAS 71.
However, the Bank’s CAR  level is still far higher than the minimum level set by  regulators at 9.95% of the RWA for banks with category 2  risk profile.
Asset Quality Ratio  NPL Ratio  BNI recorded an increase in gross NPL from 2.3% in the previous year to 4.3% as at December 31, 2020, while net  NPL during the period declined from 1.2% to 0.9%.
It is undeniable that the Covid-19 pandemic has a  significant effect on BNI’s debtors, but to manage asset  quality, BNI implements a prudent productive asset  management policy in the midst of loan expansion,  including selectively choosing credit recipient sectors  supported by management of debtors those with  problems but still have the potential for improvement  through remedial and restructuring schemes to support  improvements to the debtor’s financial and business  conditions are key to NPL management at BNI.
Financial Review Management   Discussion & Analysis 261 Uniting Energy to Revive the Country2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Coverage Ratio BNI recorded a coverage ratio of 182.4% as at December  31, 2020, increasing significantly from 133.5% in 2019.
The increase in coverage ratio represents measures to  mitigate risk of non performing loans in the future.
Profitability Ratio Return on Asset Return on Assets (ROA) was 0.5%, declining from 2.4% recorded in the previous year.
The decline in ROA was  experienced industry-wide as bank profits declined in 2020.
Return on Equity In line with the declining growth in net income, BNI  recorded a Return on Equity (ROE) of 2.9% in 2020, much  lower compared to the previous year at 14.0%.
Net Interest Margin In line with the banking industry, Net Interest Margin  (NIM) at BNI declined from 4.9% in 2019 to 4.5% in 2020,  reflecting the decline in interest income in almost all  earning assets.
BOPO Efficiency Ratio In line with the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred throughout 2020, BNI also felt the challenge of increasing  operating expenses and decreasing operating income at  the industrial level.
Reflected by the increase in the ratio  of Operating Expenses to Operating Income (BOPO) in  the Indonesian banking industry, BNI’s BOPO (Operating  Expenses to Operating Income) ratio also increased to  93.3% in 2020 from 73.2% in 2019.
During 2020 BNI’s  operating income did not grow, while operating expenses  increased significantly by 155.6% in allowance for  impairment losses as a mitigation measure for industries  affected by Covid-19.
Cost to Income Ratio  Cost to Income Ratio (CIR) is a ratio that can measure the level of efficiency of operating expenses incurred to obtain  optimal income.
BNI’s CIR increased from 43.9% in 2019  to 44.2% in 2020 in line with less-than-optimal growth of  revenue as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Liquidity Ratio Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR)  The Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) is the ratio of loans  disbursed and deposits collected by banks.
BNI  recorded LDR of 87.3% in 2020, declining from 91.5%  in the previous year.
The decline mostly reflects a more  aggressive expansion of Third Party Funds compared with  the expansion in loans.
BNI’s LDR however is still within  the requirements of PBI No. 17/11/2015 for banks’ LDR to  be within the range of 78.0% - 92.0%.
Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) BNI’s Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio was reported to have decreased to 75.4%, from 84.6% in the previous  year.
The achievement in RIM is below the regulatory  provisions of 84% - 94%, but there is relaxation in the form  of not being subject to disincentives if it is outside the  specified range.
Compliance Ratio  Statutory Reserves BNI consistently maintain an optimal level of liquidity to support daily operations and comply with Bank Indonesia  regulations through the statutory reserve requirement  (GWM).
In 2020, BNI maintain Rupiah GWM of 5.4%  and Foreign Currency GWM of 4.0%, compared to the  previous year’s position of 6.7% and 8.0%, respectively.

Total committed liabilities in 2020 increased by 3.2% compared to 2019 which was largely  influenced by an increase in the position of spot and derivative sales that were still ongoing in 2020 by 34.0%.
Contingent  claims in 2020 increased by 8.7% compared to 2019 which was dominated by an increase in Interest Income in Settlement  by 43.4%.
The position of contingent liabilities decreased slightly, namely by 0.6% compared to 2019 which was influenced  by a decrease in the bank guarantee given.
Broadly speaking, fluctuations in the movement of committed and contingent  posts are in line with credit growth, given that debtors are increasingly optimizing the use of BNI’s various products and  services with competitive features. 264 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the CountryDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING FACILITIES   BNI conducts derivative transactions for both the Bank’s and the customer’s interests.

BANK HEALTH LEVEL   The Bank’s Health Level (BHL) is the result of the Bank’s  risk and performance assessment.
The Bank Health  Level Assessment is carried out using the Risk-based  Bank Rating approach both individually as well as on a  consolidated basis.
The Bank’s health level is a means to  identify at an early stage the bank’s problems, determine  the future business strategy, formulate and implement corrective action over a bank’s weakness/problem,  provide the basis for the process of linking capital with  risk, as a basis for decision-making as well as to enhance  competitiveness.
Meanwhile, the Bank’s Health Level serves as a means for  determining the strategy and focus for supervision on the  Bank for the supervisory authorities.
The Bank’s health level rating is based on 4 (four) factors  as follows: 1.
Risk Profile  Risk Profile assessment is conducted by evaluating  the risks inherent in the bank’s activities and the  quality of risk management implementation on the 8  types of risk.
Management   Discussion & Analysis 267 Uniting Energy to Revive the Country2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk 2.
Good Corporate Governance  Good Corporate Governance assessment evaluates  the quality of the Bank’s management over the  application of Good Corporate Governance principles. 3.
Earnings  Assessment of the Earnings factor covers the  evaluation of profitability performance, profitability  sources, profitability sustainability, and profitability  management. 4.
Capital  Assessment of Capital covers the evaluation of  capital adequacy and adequacy of capital structure  management.
At BNI, evaluation of capital adequacy is  related to the Bank’s Risk Profile.
The Bank Health Level (BHL) rating is reported to the regulator (OJK) every 6 months in June and December.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the BHL  of BNI, although not significant.
This is evident in the BHL  rating of BNI for the period ending December 31, 2020, of  “Healthy”, which implies the following:  a.
The Bank’s condition was generally healthy, thereby  deemed able to withstand significant negative effects  from changes in business conditions and other  external factors.
The rating assessment factors (Risk Profile, GCG,  Profitability, and Capital) are generally good whereby if  weaknesses are apparent, then these weaknesses are  generally deemed insignificant.
BNI’s risk profile, as one of the factors in the BHL  assessment for December 31, 2020, is ranked at category  2 (low to moderate).
As a result of BNI’s risk profile which is at the Low to Moderate level and according  to calculations using the Internal Capital Adequacy  Assessment Process (ICAAP), the minimum CAR  according to the risk profile is 9.95%.
If you add a buffer  capital, namely Conservation Buffer 0% (valid up to March  31, 2022 with approval of OJK), Countercyclical Buffer  0% and Capital Surcharge 1.50%, the Minimum Capital  Adequacy Requirement (KPMM/CAR) ratio limit is 11.45%.
In 2020, BNI’s CAR of 16.8% has exceeded the specified  minimum limit.
PLEDGED ASSETS In the period ending December 31, 2020, there are no  pledged assets of BNI.
IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES TO  BANK PERFORMANCE   Throughout 2020, BI has cut its benchmark interest rate  five times to reach its lowest level in history, namely to  3.75% as of November 19, 2020.
The incessant cuts in the  benchmark interest rate are the response of the monetary  authority to the economic conditions affected by the  Covid-19 pandemic.
BI has cut interest rates by a total of  125 basis points (bps) in 2020.
The Board of Governors Meeting (RDG) of Bank Indonesia  on 16-17 December 2020 decided to maintain the BI  7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) at 3.75%, the Deposit  Facility rate at 3.00%, and the Lending Facility interest rate  at 4.50%.
This decision is consistent with forecasts for  low inflation and maintained external stability, as well as  efforts to support economic recovery.
Bank Indonesia also  strengthens policy synergies and supports various further  policies to build optimism for national economic recovery,  through opening up productive and safe economic sectors for Covid-19, accelerating fiscal stimulus, channeling  bank credit from the demand and supply side, continuing  monetary and macroprudential stimulus, and accelerate  economic and financial digitization.
The decline in the benchmark interest rate had an impact  on the condition of the national banking system, which was  under significant pressure on the decline in the net interest  margin (NIM).
The push to lower lending rates to support  Indonesia’s economic growth at a time when inflation is  more under control is gaining the right momentum.
This  has an impact on the decline in BNI’s NIM to 4.5% in 2020,  compared to 4.9% (2019) and 5.3% (2018). 268 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the CountryGROWTH OF FEE BASED INCOME  BNI recorded Rp11.9 trillion in fee-based income in 2020, an increase of 4.5% from 2019 which amounted to Rp11.4 trillion.
The increase was dominated by 4 (four) banking activities, including ATM e-channels, Trade Finance, marketable securities  and forex trading.
In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, ATM e-channel and trade finance could grow by 7.0% and 8.4%,  respectively.
A significant increase occurred in non-recurring fee income, namely marketable securities and forex trading,  which grew significantly in 2020 by 43.2% and 41.3%, respectively.

This is shown by BNI’s ability  to meet all obligations due on time, both for payment of  principal debt or interest expense.
The banking financial  ratios to measure BNI’s liquidity and solvency are as  follows: Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt (Bank  Liquidity)  BNI’s ability to meet its short-term obligations is ensured  through good liquidity management.
To improve its short- term liquidity resiliency, BNI maintains adequate liquidity  by managing a number of indicators that include Primary  Reserve (Mandatory Reserves and Cash), Secondary  Reserve (liquidity reserves), and Liquidity Coverage Ratio  (LCR) in accordance with the regulator’s provisions.
LCR is a ratio that compares the amount of High Quality  Liquid Assets (HQLA) and the estimated total net cash  outflow for the next 30 (thirty) days in a crisis scenario.
In December 2020, BNI’s LCR reached 224.2% (bank  only) and 223.6% (consolidated), above the regulator’s  stipulation that LCR compliance is at least 85% up to  March 31, 2021 or during the banking relaxation period.
In managing liquidity for a longer period of time (1 year),  BNI maintains a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFSR) by increasing the stability of bank funding according to the  composition of assets and administrative accounts.
NSFR  is the ratio of the amount of Available Stable Funding to  the amount of Required Stable Funding.
As of December  2020, BNI’s NSFR was 143.7% (bank only) and 149.4%  (consolidated), above the regulatory limit of 100%.
Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt (Bank  Solvency)  BNI’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), or the ratio of capital  to risk-weighted assets (RWA), decreased to 16.8% in  2020, compared to the capital adequacy ratio in 2019 of  19.7%.
Despite the decline in CAR, BNI’s capital structure  still has the capability to balance credit risk, market risk  and operational risk, where the ratio is higher than the  minimum capital adequacy ratio set by the regulator.
LOAN COLLECTIBILITY  BNI’s Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio increased to 4.3%  in 2020, from 2.3% in 2019.
However, net NPL improved  from 1.2% in the previous year to 0.9% in 2020.
Pressure  due to Covid-19 pandemic was a factor in the increase  of non-performing loan ratio at BNI.
However, BNI has  mitigated this risk by providing adequate provision for  non-performing loans, as indicated by an increase in the  coverage ratio from 133.5% in 2019 to 182.4% in 2020.
LOAN RESTRUCTURING  Loan restructuring is carried out on debtors who still have business prospects and is carried out selectively according  to the debtor’s ability.
The amount of restructured loans  at the end of 2020 reached Rp148.9 trillion, an increase of  287.8% compared to the previous year, with the following  details: 1.
Extension of loan tenor to a total of Rp32.4 trillion of  loans, up by 720.7% from the previous year. 2.
Reduction of loan interest rate to a total of Rp45.6 trillion of loans, up by 234.1.4% from the previous  year. 3.
Extension of loan tenor, reduction of loan interest rate and other forms of restructuring to a total of Rp71.0  trillion of loans, up by 241.0% from the previous year.
Based on collectibility as of December 31, 2020,  restructured loans were classified as current at 77.2%,  doubtful at 14.2% and non-performing loans (NPLs) reaching 8.5%.
In terms of currency, 90.5% of the  restructured loans were denominated in Rupiah, with the  remaining denominated in USD and SGD.

TRANSFER PRICING DOCUMENT Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) No. 213/PM.03/2016  concerning Types of Documents and/or Additional  Information that Must Be Stored by Taxpayers Conducting  Transactions with Parties with Special Relationships, and  Procedures for Management.
This regulation intends to improve the quality of  documents prepared by taxpayers and increase  transparency.

PT Bank Negara Indonesia, Tbk (BNI) as a  taxpayer who obeys and complies with all existing tax  regulations and has complied with these regulations.
Preliminary The Ministry of Finance issued a new regulation on  taxpayers required to make Transfer Pricing Documentation  (TP Doc).
This new TP rule complements the provisions  related to the application of the principle of fairness and  common business practice in transactions involving related  parties.
Based on the definition in Article 1 number 6 PMK-213/ PM.03/2016 it is stated that the transfer pricing document  is a document that has been violated by the taxpayer as  the basis for applying the principle of fairness and common  business Practices in determining the transfer price carried  out by the Taxpayer.
This regulation was issued in connection with the  provisions of the transfer pricing document, and did not  replace the applicable regulation to regulate the principle  of fairness and common business practices, namely DJP Regulation No.
PER- 43/PJ/2010 as last amended by DJP  Regulation No.
PER-32/PJ/2011 concerning the Application  of Principles of Fairness and Common Business Practice in  Transactions Between Taxpayers and Related Parties.
Types of Documents That Must be  Organized Based on these regulations, taxpayers are required to  maintain and keep 3 (three) levels of documents consisting  of: 1.
Local Documents; and 3.

Subjects Required to Make Transfer  Pricing Document Parties that are required to make Transfer Pricing   Document can be grouped into 2 (two), namely: 1.

Based on the results of the assessment  carried out, all transactions conducted by BNI with related  parties have met the specified fairness limit.
ACCESS TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION  FOR T AXATION PURPOSES Preliminary  The Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information  or (AEOI) is the G20 countries’ plan and was initiated  by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) regarding a system that supports  the exchange of taxpayer account information between  countries.
With this system, taxpayers who have opened accounts  in other countries will be tracked directly by their home  country’s Tax Authorities.
AEOI has a new global standard  that will be useful to reduce the chance of avoiding tax  payments.
The AEOI work system is the exchange of financial data  of foreign nationals living in a country.
The exchange of  financial data is not done arbitrarily, but rather is carried out  between the tax authorities in each country.
Every country  that has joined the AEOI system will send and receive  pre-agreed information every year without having to submit  special requests.
In Indonesia itself, with the presence of AEOI, the  Directorate General of Taxes can supervise and explore  potential taxation through banking transactions or other financial institutions conducted by taxpayers abroad and  developed so that it applies to taxpayers in the country.
It  is done to strengthen the database which so far has limited  access so that it is expected that the potential of state  revenue from the tax sector can be maximized.
Scope  In accordance with Law No. 9 of 2017 concerning Determination of Government Regulation in Lieu of  Law Number 1 of 2017 concerning Access to Financial  Information for Taxation Purposes, the scope of access to  financial information is divided into 2 (two), namely: 1.

Supported by the predicted  improvement in economic conditions accompanied by  the easing of monetary and fiscal policies carried out by  Bank Indonesia (BI), the Financial Services Authority (OJK)  estimates that credit growth in 2020 will be 13.0%.
Aside from macroeconomic considerations, another factor  that affects the sustainability of BNI is the 4th Industrial  Revolution or Industry 4.0.
The industrial revolution is  expected to have a fundamental impact because it has  the potential to change the way industry works, from  production to sales by utilizing information technology.
Industry 4.0 will make it easier for MSMEs to access  a wider market in a more cost-effective way, and will open up opportunities to open new businesses as well  as the need for loan capital.
On the other hand, opening  up market access allows MSMEs to compete head to  head with big players, so it needs good monitoring and  management to survive.
INFORMATION ON BUSINESS  CONTINUITY Matters with Potential Significant Effect  on Business Continuity According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in  its World Economic Outlook report published in October  2019, world economic growth is projected to improve by  3.4% in 2020 compared to world GDP growth in 2019  which is estimated at 3.0%.
The key driving force for  the improvement of global economic growth is the GDP  growth of developing countries by 4.6% while the GDP  growth of developed countries is still relatively stagnant at  1.7%.
In line with the growth projection from the IMF , the World  Bank in its Global Economic Prospects report published in  January 2020 also estimates that global economic growth  will improve in 2020, although on a limited scale of 2.5%,  compared to the previous year of 2.4%.
The improvement  in world GDP growth was mainly driven by the economic  growth of countries that were included in the Emerging  Market and Developing Economies (EMDE) category at 4.1%, compared to GDP growth in developed countries  which only grew 1.4%. 298 2020 Annual Report PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Uniting Energy to Revive the CountryManagement Assessment on Matters with  Potential Significant Effect on Business Continuity Responding to these challenges, BNI developed an end- to-end digital credit process to support a faster process  supported by monitoring using data analytics.
In addition,  BNI continues to improve credit quality through the  development of an early warning system and improvement  of the overall process, as well as by continuously  refreshing loan employees.
In addition, BNI internally manages productive assets with  prudence in the midst of banking business expansion while  responding to the challenges of the Cost to Income Ratio  (CIR) and the ratio of Operating Expenses to Operating  Income (BOPO) which are still relatively high.
BNI views  it as important to increase productivity and efficiency in  banking processes to support business initiatives and bank  strategies in providing maximum service to customers.
The steps taken by BNI are carried out by considering  the strengths of BNI which has the highest credit growth  compared to competing banks; Highest growth in the  Corporate Segment compared to Competing Banks; high  KUR growth; good cash management skills; high payroll  growth; best remittance service providers; and utilization of  API Management.
In addition, BNI also considers and takes advantage of  business opportunities in the banking industry in the future  to ensure the continuity of the Bank’s business.
These  opportunities include: infrastructure policy sustainability;  investment policy that is opened as widely as possible;  plans for issuing state-owned banking and financial  services holding; simultaneous regional elections 2020;  and the upward trend in electronic money transactions  above TPF growth.
Several other business opportunities  were triggered by high millennial financial transactions, implementation of Qanun, and implementation of  Sustainable Financing.
Assumptions Used by Management in  Performing the Assessment on Matters with Potential Significant Effect on Business Continuity BNI considers a number of factors in conducting an  assessment of business continuity based on the Bank’s  Business Plan, including the following: •	 Capital •		 Liquidity •	 Profitability •	 Asset	Quality These four factors serve as one of the evaluations of  the Bank’s short and medium term performance which  are outlined in the Bank’s Business Plan and Corporate  Plan, which is a reference for BNI to continue to grow  and develop in the Indonesian banking industry.
The Bank  Business Plan document is prepared as a reference in  carrying out BNI’s operational activities in the short term in  accordance with the Vision, Mission and Direction of BNI  as stated in the Bank’s Long Term Plan (Corporate Plan).
In addition, considering the increasing competition in the  banking industry, BNI has 5 (five) magnitude of strategies  in facing banking industry competition as follows: a.
Capturing the business potential from the flow of  funds of State Budget and Regional Government  Budget (APBN & APBD) by penetrating the market  share of regional managed hospitals, educational  institutions in the regions, especially those whose  operations are sourced from the APBN & APBD and  government programs related to social assistance  and subsidies.
In addition, striving for BNI to become  an operational bank for Regional Governments/Local  Governments so that it can facilitate transactions  within regions or between regions to the center.
Through transactional solutions that focus on partners  in government ministries/agencies, BUMN, Non- Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) and universities to increase regional revenue while increasing  accountability for regional financial management.

Internal  factors include BNI’s ability to mobilize and allocate  resources and maintain and develop its core capabilities  which are important factors in anticipating and taking  business opportunities from existing external conditions.
External factors that affect the prospects for the Bank’s  business are economic, political, social, technological,  environmental and regulatory conditions.
In general, global  economic conditions are predicted to improve in the future,  supported by increased mobility and policy stimulus in  various countries.
The speed of global economic recovery  will also be influenced by progress in handling Covid-19,  especially the implementation of vaccination; increased  mobility; magnitude and speed of policy stimulus;  conditions in the financial and corporate sectors; as well as  the economic structure of a country.
The domestic economy has begun to improve in semester  II 2020 and is predicted to continue to strengthen in  2021.
Developments in a number of early indicators up to  the end of December 2020 confirm the direction of this  recovery, such as strengthening consumer confidence  and expectations regarding income, job availability and  business activities.
The prospect of speed of recovery  will be heavily influenced by vaccinations and public  discipline in implementing the Covid-19 protocol, which is a  prerequisite for the national economic recovery.
In addition, various policies to promote economic recovery  need to be implemented, namely (i) opening up productive  and safe sectors nationally and in respective regions, (ii)  accelerating fiscal realization, (iii) increasing bank credit  from the demand and supply side, (iv) the continuation of monetary and macroprudential stimulus, and (v)  the acceleration of economic and financial digitization,  particularly in relation to the development of MSMEs,  are also factors affecting the prospects for domestic  economic recovery.
With these various supporting factors,  Indonesia’s economic growth in 2021 is estimated to grow  in the range of 4.8%-5.8%.
Bank credit growth is predicted to improve in 2021 in line with improving business conditions.
The results of the  Banking Survey also showed an increase in the need for  financing and plans to apply for loans, issuance of bonds and stocks, and domestic debt in the next 3-6 months.
Lending will also remain conducive with low interest rates,  abundant liquidity, improved credit requirements (lending  standards), and the extension of the credit restructuring  program by OJK, while still applying the principle of  prudence and avoiding moral hazard. 2019-2025 LONG-TERM STRATEGY   In order to achieve BNI’s targets and objectives in the year  2025, BNI has formulated a Business Strategy as well as  a Functional Strategy, which are complementary to each  other.

Emphasis on the phrase Together  indicates that employees and BNI are two entities that are  interrelated and inseparable in realizing BNI’s vision.
HC Architecture consists of organizations and employees  that are related to one another.
The organization has  goals to be attained, strategies for achieving these goals,  and a set of organizational culture that guides behavior.
Employees (people) are expected to be able to perform well in supporting the achievement of organizational goals,  to have competencies that are in line with the strategy, and  to behave in consistent with the organizational culture.

For Employees  During the Covid-19 pandemic, BNI has implemented  Work from Home (WFH), Work from Office (WFO),  Shift and Split Operations, to limit activities within  the BNI environment.
In case the employees were  required to undertake WFO and located in areas with  restrictions or high-risk zones, they were provided  with healthy, clean, and nutritious lunch and equipped  with health supplement.
This effort was aimed to  limit the activities of eating outside the office, thus  minimizing potential transmission of Covid-19 amongst  employees.
In addition, the management also gave  transportation assistance such as online taxi vouchers  and operational cars.
Moreover, the employees  can periodically take periodic antigen swab test to  continuously provide a sense of security at work.
Curative For employees who were exposed to Covid-19, BNI took  serious care in supporting their recovery from Covid-19.
The support given by the Company include providing  vitamin supplementation for employees who were  confirmed positive, providing independent isolation spots,  and assisting on financial support when the employees  needed special care for monitoring the condition.
Monitoring Specifically, BNI has established the Emergency Task Force  (ETF) team in the respective unit tasked with monitoring  the health of employees in the unit.

Capability Development  Learning Programs During the Covid-19 Pandemic  Despite the pandemic situation, the employee capability  development strategy is still implemented with a number  of adjustments, especially in the learning delivery  mechanism.
The face-to-face method, which is initially one  of the primary methods, is now being adapted to a number  of alternative strategies including: •	 Adjustment	of	the	delivery	method	to	be	100%	digital	 compared to only around 20% previously.
The change presented its own challenges as it involves changing  the mindset and behavior of employees to learn  online, preparing the capabilities of facilitators to teach  online, and strengthening the capabilities of the digital  support infrastructure.
•	 Designing	gamification	learning	applications	to	 accelerate changes in employee behavior in learning  through a new learning experience that is different  from conventional learning.
•	 Organizing	a	webinar	series	through	the	Knowledge	 Supplement program which can be accessed through the BNI Corporate University Youtube channel.

monitoring, especially for employees who are sick.
If  employees need special assistance, the ETF team is also  ready to coordinate and provide the support needed by  employees regarding their conditions.
Data on health conditions for all BNI employees is  integrated data that is reported daily to management as  part of BNI’s efforts to maintain employee health.
For  management, this can be the basis for making decisions  on the right strategy change in dealing with pandemic conditions, while for employees with daily monitoring it  makes employees feel fully cared for and supported by  BNI.
In the event that an employee is exposed, BNI also  actively pays attention to the 3T protocol or testing, tracing  and treatment.
Employees who are in close contact with,  and are in the same area with positive employees will be  tested so that if there are positive employees they can be  treated early on.
In addition to initiatives in employee monitoring, BNI also  has a Covid Ranger as a Change Agent in socializing a new  lifestyle, namely 3M or wearing masks, washing hands and  maintaining distance.
Apart from being carried out by Covid  Ranger, 3M socialization was also carried out through the  installation of banners & posters, stickers and through  webinars.
In addition to the Covid Ranger and ETF teams,  each line manager is also responsible for the health of all members of their respective team.

Talent Management To realize BNI’s vision and mission, BNI Human Capital is committed to manage BNI’s talents through the Talent  Management System.
Talent Management performed by  BNI consists of Talent Acquisition, Talent Classification,  Talent Development, Talent Mobility and Talent Retention.
All stages of talent management involve the role of the  Talent Committee that aims to ensure that the Talent  Management process can take place objectively and in  standardized manner.
In line with the objective of managing integrated human  resources, the talent management process implemented  at BNI focuses on preparing, developing, and retaining  employees while adhering to the Employee Value  Proposition (EVP).
BNI is committed to managing talent  consistently with a long term orientation.
A number of  talent management programs implemented in 2020 were  the following: Career Acceleration In line with the Company’s strategy, in which one of the focuses is to prepare the Company to compete in the  future, BNI provides opportunities for its best talents to  develop careers according to their capability and capacity  through a career acceleration program to occupy leadership  positions.
The career acceleration program is carried out with strict  selection with the aim of ensuring that employees who  participate in this program have qualified capabilities before  occupying the target position.
There are 2 (two) paths that  can be taken by employees, namely career acceleration  without going through the regular career path stages (skip  path), and career acceleration with a shorter period than  the usual (speed path).
This program shows to all BNI Hi-Movers that BNI  management does not fail to pay attention to the performance of all Hi-Movers wherever they are placed.
The opportunity career acceleration that I got from AMGR to AVP at the age of 29, spurred me to prove that I can carry out the responsibilities I’m entrusted with.
Challenging targets and work environments of different  generations are challenges in shaping the team’s character in making the outlet I lead a profit center.
The opportunity to exchange ideas with the Regional Leaders, Deputy District Leaders and Branch Leaders as mentors stimulates new ideas and enthusiasm.
Good communication among the participants of this program is one of the ways to promote the spirit to achieve the highest management expectations.
I believe that this program can be a pioneer in increasing  the ability of outlets to work on business and turn all BNI outlets into profit centers.
Proud to be a BNI Hi-Movers.
