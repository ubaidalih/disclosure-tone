Performance Highlights Management Reports Company Profile Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social  ResponsibilityAmid the crisis impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with its  challenges and uncertainties for the global and domestic economy, BRI was able to conclude 2020 with a good performance.
It was due to BRI’s commitment to sustainably growing in the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) segment and the support from accommodative government and regulators’ policies to accelerate the national economic recovery.
BRI recorded Rp1,511.81 trillion of Total Assets (consolidated) as  of the end of 2020, the highest in the history of the Company.
Grew 6.71% from Rp1,416.76 as of the end of 2019.
Asset growth was contributed by Loans that increased by 3.89% year-on-year to Rp938.38 trillion.
MSME segment was the major contributor to the increase, composing 82.13% of total loans as of the end of 2020.
Positive loan growth during the pandemic was accompanied by well-maintained credit quality where the Gross Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio was 2.99%, below the maximum ratio set by the regulator.
Meanwhile, BRI’s consolidated third party funds reached Rp1,121.10  trillion or grew 9.78% from Rp1,021.20 trillion in 2019, contributed by low-cost funds (CASA).

Changing Adversities to Will-PowerManagement Discussion & Analysis04GLOBAL ECONOMY  In 2020, the world was shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in China and rapidly spread to many other  countries.
COVID-19 has changed people’s behaviour and weakened the world economy.
COVID-19 also triggered  fear, which prompted countries to shut down economic activities and limit social activities, resulting in a slowdown in  business activities.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that world economic growth in 2020 was at -3.5% and projected to  increase to 5.5% in 2021, supported by economic growth in developing countries. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021*1.74.36.4 5.45.14.7 4.34.6 4.84.5 3.66.3 -3.55.5 -4.94.3 2.8 1.63.6 2.33.8 2.53.4 1.73.5 2.33.6 2.13.5 1.43.5 1.2 Emerging Market & Developing Economics World Advances EconomicsGlobal Economic Growth Trends (%) * Projection Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook Update, Janury 2021-2.4ECONOMY & INDUSTRIAL  REVIEW Annual Report 2020205 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.
Performance Highlights Management Reports Company Profile Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social  ResponsibilityThe availability of COVID-19 vaccines with a high level of effectiveness, such as Pfizer, Sinovac, and Moderna,  provides a positive sentiment for global economic development.
However, a second wave pandemic in many countries  in Europe could threaten the global economy in the future.
Both the developed and developing countries adopt countercyclical fiscal policies to sustain their economies by  increasing government spending and providing tax incentives.
In monetary policy, the US central bank (The Federal  Reserve) and European Central Bank (ECB) lowered their policy rates and have maintained low policy rates.
The Fed, for example, holds the policy rate in the 0% - 0.25% range.
INdONEsIAN ECONOMY The Indonesian economy is also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The implementation of Large-Scale Social Re-strictions (PSBB) during the pandemic resulted in a slowdown in economic activities across all societies.
Concerns and  uncertainties caused by the pandemic led to a trend of capital outflows from the stock and bond markets, putting  pressure on the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar.
In the real sector, domestic demand was also affected by PSBB implementation, while the contraction in global demand resulted in the lower volume of Indonesian exports.
The economy started to experience contraction, as reflected in the minus 5.32% growth in the second quarter of  2020.
However, with various accommodative Government and Regulatory policies set during the pandemic, the domestic  economy began to show recovery signs although still contracting.
Indonesia’s economic growth on a year-on-year basis was improving to -3.49% in Q3 2020 and -2.07% in Q4 2020.
The Rupiah exchange rate against the USD also showed a recovery sign, as it improved to the pre-pandemic level,  closed at Rp14,050/US$ at the end of 2020.
The position of Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves was also well-maintained, recorded at US$135.9 billion as of  December 2020 or equivalent to 10.2 months of imports and the government’s foreign debt payments.
It was above  the international adequacy standard of about three months of imports.

In the recovery  program, the government issued various stimulus, including through POJK 11, which provided credit relaxation to  debtors affected by COVID-19, PMK 70 and 104 regarding the placement of government funds, PMK 71 on credit guarantees borne by the government, and PMK 138 that provided loan interest subsidies.
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia  conducted monetary easing by gradually lowering the policy rate (BI7DRR) to 3.75% as of the end of 2020 from  previously 5% (beginning of 2020).
Bank Indonesia also conducted quantitative easing by purchasing government bonds through the primary and secondary markets.

Economy & Industrial Review National Banking Industry Analysis Amid the challenging situations and uncertainties  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indonesian  banking industry is still well-maintained.
Based on OJK  data as of November 2020, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was maintained at the level of 24.25%, higher  than the same period in 2019 of 23.77%.
The banking  industry also had adequate liquidity, as demonstrated by the Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 82.33%.
In terms of growth, the national banking industry  recorded Rp9,053 trillion in total assets as of   November 2020 or increased by 7.64% year on year.
However, commercial bank loan growth was still under pressure and decreased by 1.4% year on year  to Rp5,447 trillion, in line with the weak demand for  credit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Credit quality indicated by the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio was  able to be maintained at 3.18%, below the maximum of 5% set by the regulator.
Meanwhile, third party funds (DPK) recorded double- digit growth of 11.55% year on year to Rp6,000  trillion.
The pandemic situation and the implementation  of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) have encouraged people to hold back on consumption,  thereby causing an upward trend in third party funds.
In terms of profitability, the national banking industry  recorded Net Income of Rp98 trillion as of November  2020 and positive profitability ratios, as indicated by Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 4.41% and Return on  Assets (ROA) of 1.64%.

This  card can be used as farmers’ identities.
There is also information on subsidized fertilizer quotas.
Farmers  can also use this card to pay for subsidized fertilizer at  the Fertilizer Kiosks and carry out banking transactions through electronic channels.
The BRI Farmer Card was first initiated in Central  Java on 4 March 2015.
On 20 February 2017, the  Minister of Agriculture and Minister of SOEs instructed  HIMBARA banks to carry out a trial of the Farmer Card program in Java.
According to the Minister of Agriculture Regulation  No. 47/Permentan/SR.310/12/2017 on the Allocation  and Highest Retail Price of Subsidized Fertilizer for the Agricultural Sector in the 2018 Fiscal year, Farmer  Cards are given to farmers who are members of  farmer groups and carry out farming activities within a certain space of land.
For farmers in the food crop,  horticulture, plantation, and animal husbandry sectors,  the maximum land area is 2 Ha.
While for farmers in the aquaculture sector, the maximum land area is 1  Ha.
Farmers with their farmer groups must prepare an  RDKK (Definitive Plan for Subsidized Fertilizer Needs) to be uploaded in the Ministry of Agriculture’s E-RDKK  system by the Subdistrict Agriculture Instructor.
The  Bank will open an account and issue a Farmer Card for farmers registered at the Ministry of Agriculture’s  E-RDKK.
Every subsidized fertilizer purchase transaction that  uses Farmer Card can be monitored online in real-time  by the government through a dashboard supported by  BRI.
Thus, the government can ensure the subsidized fertilizer is delivered to the intended recipient (by  name by address).
The monitoring dashboard also  helps fertilizer producers to obtain data regarding the spread of subsidized fertilizer needs and data needed  to charge subsidized fertilizer production costs to the  government.
BRI also uses the data of farmers receiving the Farmer Card as a loan pipeline to increase the scale  of farmers’ businesses.
The use of Farmer Card as payment card for subsidized  fertilizer at Fertilizer Kiosks, who are also branchless  banking (Laku Pandai) agents, is a form of financial literacy and inclusion in Indonesia’s agricultural  ecosystem.
With the Farmer Card, farmers get certainty  of subsidized fertilizer availability; hence farming activities are not disrupted.
Farmers whose data  are registered in the system also obtain additional  benefits, such as assistance in acquiring other farming production tools, absorption of harvest from off-taker  companies, registration of farming insurance, and bank  loans.
As of December 2020, BRI had printed 5,117,792  Farmer Cards and distributed 3,703,521, or 72.37% of the total cards printed, to farmers.
In terms of Fertilizer Kiosks, as many as 7,044 kiosks  are BRILink agents and have EDC machines installed.
Using Farmer Cards, a total of 571,785 tonnes worth  Rp1.02 trillion subsidized fertilizer were purchased  using the Card. 224 125 Years BRI Helps To Leverage MSMEs.

AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURsHIP PROGRAM The Ministry of SOE appointed BRI to pioneer the Agricultural Entrepreneurship Program.
This program  aims to encourage farmers to become entrepreneurs.
The government provides support through modern agricultural infrastructure and working capital.
The Agricultural Entrepreneurship Program is a  collaboration between the Ministry of SOE, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Village, Development  of Disadvantaged Regions, and Transmigration.
They  work together with farmers and Provincially-Owned Enterprises (BUMDES) to create added value for  farmers to increase their welfare.
The collaboration that  was built was realized by forming PT Mitra Bumdes Nusantara (MBN).
As of July 2020, all programs under  the Association of State-Owned Banks (Himbara)  responsibility were carried out well.
In 2020, in collaboration with the Ministry of  Agriculture and other stakeholders, after the Tasikmalaya project, Bank BRI prepared three new  project initiatives in Demak, Subang, and Ngawi.
These  three projects will be the benchmark in growing and developing 350 farming corporations until 2024, as  was planned by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Bank BRI plays a role in providing KUR and other microloans  for farmers, and business management assistance and  mentoring related to farmer empowerment programs.
The expected outcome for BRI Micro Businesses is the creation of current and future micro business customer  base.
BRI’s role as a modern, pro-people bank BRI, as a bank, not only fully supports the distribution  of working capital but also provides assistance for  farmers.
For example, business matching, where the  Bank introduces potential off-takers to farmer groups.
Agricultural entrepreneurship in Demak and Subang  are currently being developed with a business matching  concept.
The identification results in the two regions show that most farmers’ production practices do  not experience problems.
However, they are still less  competitive in terms of marketing, especially the selling price of products.
The proximity of BRI Unit to farmers  is this program’s success key.
The Mantri (loan officer)  Work intensification program known as the Mantri Revitalization immensely helped this program run  well, starting from identification, implementation, to  reporting process.
Performance Highlights Management Reports Company Profile Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social  ResponsibilityBusiness matching is expected to increase farmers’  margins in the agricultural entrepreneurship ecosystem  and finally increase their production capacity.
BRI  also expects that this will be BRI’s step to get closer to farmers so that it can be the new hope for the  sustainability of BRI’s micro business in the future.
The six steps of Agricultural Entrepreneurship are as  follow: Modernization of Production Process Switching the agricultural process from traditional to  modern  Groups Strengthening  If possible, the group becomes a business entity or even a legal entity  Financial Inclusion  Provide access to banking services for farmers Strengthening the Farmers Farmers in certain economies of scale that are suitable to be developed no longer work individually but in groups Institutional Strengthening Institutions (Business Entities/Legal Entities) are the off- takers for farmers Farmers’ Welfare This ecosystem will increase the welfare of farmers from upstream to downstreamBRI For Indonesia Micro Business Productive Assistance (BPUM)  The government continues to accelerate economic recovery through the National Economic Recovery  Program (PEN) stimulus.

Micro Business Productive Assistance (BPUM) has been  distributed since August 2020 as part of the National  Economic Recovery Acceleration (PEN) program.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk is one of the  banks appointed to distribute the aid to the public.
The government launched the BPUM program to help microbusiness owners to survive during the pandemic.
As of December 2020, as the government’s main  partner in the PEN program, BRI had distributed a total  of Rp18.6 trillion of BPUM to 7.76 million beneficiaries.

Changing Adversities to Will-PowerManagement Discussion & Analysis04sOLVENCY The Bank’s solvency is indicated by the following financial ratios:  LIQUIdITY RATIO Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) Liquidity ratio is a comparison of loan to deposit ratio or LDR.
In 2020, BRI recorded LDR of 83.66% (bank only),  indicating a well-managed liquidity condition during the Covid-19 pandemic.
By year on year, the decrease trend  of LDR was inseparable from low loan demand during the pandemic and the preferences of people to refrain from  spending.
Macroprudential Intermediary Ratio (MIR) Pursuant to Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 20/4/PBI/2018 dated 3 April 2018, banking MIR was expected to reach 84% to 94%.
In MIR calculation, securities issued and administered by KSEI was calculated and was not held by banks  at a minimum of 2 months prior to report date and held corporate bonds.
RIM calculation was also updated by PBI  Nol 21/12/PBI/2019 which took effect on 2 December 2019 by calculating offshore loans as a component of funding, BRI MIR ratio was 85.31% (bank only), decreased compared to 85.31% in 2019.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) To improve short term liquidity defense, BRI exercises Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) management which is a ratio between high quality liquid assets (HQLA) with net cash outflow during the next 30 days.
In 2020, BRI LCR was at  239.06% (bank only).
With these LCR, BRI was able to maintain liquidity adequacy ratio far above the minimum limit  of 100%.
EARNINGs RATIO In the banking industry, earnings ratio is generally measured by using Return on Assets or ROA, Return on Equity or ROE, and net income margin or NIM.
During 2020, BRI has recorded positive earnings performance.
Earnings Ratio  (%) (Bank Only)  2018 2019 2020 ROA 3.68 3.50 1.98 ROE 20.49 19.41 11.05 NIM 7.45 6.98 6.00 Return on Assets (ROA) BRI Return on Assets (ROA) in 2020 was 1.98% (bank only), or decreased compared to 3.50% in 2019.
The decrease was due to a decrease of interest income resulted from massive loan restructuring for MSMEs impacted by the  Covid-19 as well as an increase of allowance of earnings assets as mitigation effort on the potential of decelerated  assets quality due to the pandemic.
Performance Highlights Management Reports Company Profile Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Corporate Social  ResponsibilityReturn on Equity (ROE) In 2020, BRI Return on Equity (ROE) was 11.05% (bank only), or decreased compared to 19.41% (bank only) in 2019.
The decrease of ROE was due to a decrease of interest income resulted from massive loan restructuring for MSMEs  impacted by the Covid-19 as well as an increase of allowance of earnings assets as mitigation effort on the potential  of decelerated assets quality due to the pandemic.
Net Interest Margin (NIM) In 2020, BRI Net Interest Margin (NIM) was 6.00% (bank only) or lower than 6.98% (bank only) in 2019.
The decrease of NIM was due to a decrease of interest income resulted from massive loan restructuring for MSMEs  impacted by the Covid-19 as well as an increase of allowance of earnings assets as mitigation effort on the potential  of decelerated assets quality due to the pandemic.
EFFICIENCY RATIO Operating Expense to Operating Income Ratio (BOPO) In 2020, BRI Operating Expense to Operating Income Ratio (BOPO) was 80.22% (bank only), increased from 70.10% (bank only) in 2019.
The increase of BOPO was due to pressure in the interest income in line with loan restructuring  for MSMEs impacted by the Covid-19 as well as an increase of allowance of earnings assets as mitigation effort on  the potential of decelerated assets quality due to the pandemic.
Efficiency Ratio (%) (Bank Only)  2018 2019 2020 BOPO 68,40 70,10 81,22 Capital Ratio - Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) reflects the Bank’s ability to mitigate risk.
In 2020, BRI CAR was 20.61% (bank only), decreased from 22.55% (bank only) in 2019.
The CAR ratio is still far above the minimum ratio that must  be maintained at 14.75%, taking into account the relaxation of CCB (Capital Concervation Buffer) until March  2021, by having taken into account Basel 3 implementation.
With the high capital adequacy ratio, BRI is able to anticipate all the main risks that occur in bank management both market risk, credit risk, and operational risk and the  implementation of Basel 3.
COMPLIANCE RATIO Percentage of Lending in Excess of Legal Lending Limit In 2020, there were no debtors, related parties or otherwise, that did not meet or exceeded the Legal Lending Limit  (LLL).
Net Open Position Ratio (NOP) NOP is the sum of the absolute values of the net difference between assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position for each foreign currency and the net difference of commitments and contingent liabilities and receivables in  the administrative accounts for each foreign currency, stated in Rupiah toward capital.
In 2020, NOP ratio was 1.07%  (bank only), decreased from 1.97% (bank only) in 2019.
This NOP is still far below the maximum level stipulated by BRI on the Commercial Banks’ Net Open Position, which is 20% of the capital.

Changing Adversities to Will-PowerManagement Discussion & Analysis04PRIME LENdING RATEFinancial Review In general, Prime Lending Rate is calculated based on  3 (three) components, namely Fund Cost for Credit  arising from customer fund raising activities, operating  expenses incurred for fund raising activities and lending and profit margin components from lending.
Prime  lending calculation does not take into account the risk  premium component of the debtor, whose amount depends on the assessment of the risk of each debtor.
As such, the amount of credit interest charged to  debtors is not necessarily the same as the prime lending rate.
The prime lending rate calculation applies to corporate  loans, retail loans, micro loans, and consumer loans  (mortgages and non-mortgages).
In non-mortgages of consumer loans does not include the distribution  of funds through Credit Cards and Unsecured Loan.
However, Bank Indonesia submitted the credit  classification according to the bank’s internal criteria.
Due to the economic pressure impacted by the  Covid-19 pandemic, Bank Indonesia has stipulated  monetary policy strategy hence during 2020 BI aggressively decreased reference interest rate BI7DRR at  125 bps.
This has enabled faster adjustment of deposits  interest rates compared to lending interest rates.
To respond BI policies, BRI has reduced its basic lending  rates during 2020 especially for MSMEs segment at  around 15-75bps.

To anticipate the impact of this potential disruption, BRI Board of Directors  developed and implemented a Business Continuity  Management (BCM) Policy set out in the BRI NOSE Circular Letter: S.26-DIR/DMR/12/2016.
The objectives  of BCM policies include to protecting the employees’  lives’ security and safety, protecting the customers and other stakeholders’ lives in the BRI Operational Work  Unit in accordance with the Disaster Management Plan,  and maintaining the continuity of the most important business/operational activities, safeguarding BRI assets  and responding adequate in a disruption/disaster  situation (Business Continuity Plan).
Currently the challenges from BCM apart from the 4 (four) factors  above are related to the Covid-19 Pandemic in the New  Normal era and the Digitalization of the Banking and Financial System which can cause many disruptions,  one of which is Cyber   Attack.
The implementation of BRI BCM covers all BRI work units which, among others, is carried out through the  establishment of the BCM Organizational Structure consisting of the Business Continuity Management  Team and the Crisis Management Team, the  preparation of a Call Tree and the establishment of alternate sites.

As one of the  implementations of BCM, BRI already has Emergency  Response Plan (ER Plan) guidelines and Business Continuity Plan (BC Plan) policies for Critical Work  Units.
To ensure that the policy can be used in the  event of a disruption/disaster, the ER Plan and BC Plan trials are carried out annually and prioritized for  disaster-prone work units.

In 2020, EPE  was Rp285 million per permanent employee, which  was lower than the 2019 EPE of Rp556.16 million per permanent employee.
The decrease in EPE was a result  of lower productivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Human Capital Development Performance Appraisal and Remuneration BRI assesses employee performance based on  employee’s achievement of key performance indicators  (KPI) and employee’s competency fulfillment or  improvement.
The system was established with the aim: to ensure  the conformity of employee’s performance with the Company’s performance; to encourage, motivate,  and direct employees to continuously improve  their performances; and to realize clear relations between target achievements and employee’s career  development (promotion).
Performance appraisal result  determines employee’s compensation and benefits and talent class.
To develop a performance-driven culture within the  Company, BRI sharpens its performance assessment  by, among others, standardizing the contents of  Objective Performance Targets (Sasaran Kinerja Objektif /SKO) for Unit Heads, employees holding structural  positions, and marketing officers.
Automation and  monitoring of KPI target achievements on marketing officers are carried out with quarterly performance  appraisal.

The aim is to ensure that performance appraisal  is not only carried out from 1 vertical direction of supervisors to staff but also vice versa and between  fellow employees.
BRI sets the KPI in the Performance  Management System (SMK) by integrating the Company’s targets to all of its employees, hence  aligning both individual and the Company’s KPI.
As  such, competence-based performance appraisal is expected to deliver objective and fair results.

In pursuit of BRI’s vision of becoming  “The Most Valuable Bank in Southeast Asia” and the “Home to the Best Talent”, the Change Management  & Transformation Office (CMT) Directorate introduced  BRIvolution 1.0, focusing on digital and culture transformation.
Digital transformation aimed to  enhance the efficiency of business processes and  prepare BRI to always be on the lead, whereas culture transformation emphasizes on meritocracy.
A transformation journey has not been easy to  accomplish and BRI has been forced to weather  different challenges along the way.
Economic  uncertainty, equally innovative ideas from peers and fintech companies, the rapid change of market  behavior and customer preference, and an even more  difficult business situation due to the pandemic have created setbacks for BRI and the Bank’s attainment of  the targets set out in the 2018-2022 Corporate Plan.
The gap between what we aspired and what  we achieved in reality prompted BRI to revisit its  BRIvolution 1.0.
This resulted in the management’s decision to adjust BRIvolution 1.0, creating an improved  plan of BRIvolution 2.0, which will be implemented in  2021.
Given that the success of BRI’s transformation is crucial, the Bank’s Board of Management (Board of  Directors and SEVP) and the Board of Commissioners  organized a Board Forum on 2 October 2020 in Bandung.
The Board Forum discussed and reflected upon  the BRIvolution 1.0 journey (Look Back), the future  development of the banking sector and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the pandemic’s  implications to BRI (Look Around), and the key  strategies to realize BRI’s long-term growth (Look Ahead).
In practical terms, the Forum focused on  business initiatives relating to CASA, credit, product  cross-selling, customer service, new growth engines, and culture and capabilities as core enablers.
We realize that the challenges in 2016, when the  transformation was first initiated, were vastly different  than they are today.
BRI identified five primary  challenges that at the time had been predominant in the banking sector, namely decelerated growth,  increased pressure on BRI’s profitability and liquidity,  changes in customer behavior marked by the growing number of digital-savvy customers, business  potentials in 14 major Indonesian cities, and aggressive  competition from non-traditional players.
Today, what we are witnessing are the profound impacts of  the COVID-19 pandemic to global economic growth,  BRI’s role as a state-owned bank in exercising its social responsibility mandated by the government, and banks’  efforts to adapt to a new normal that demand us to re- think about our capability and the way we do business.

Changing Adversities to Will-PowerManagement Discussion & Analysis04Mr.
Sunarso as the President Director of BRI presented  the result of assessment on BRI’s transformation  progress to date.
Overall, the BRIvolution 1.0 was  executed well enough, but not all programs were completed, and therefore the strategic initiatives  needed to be sharpened.
A transformation journey  could also even be more challenging if not viewed as a long-term process to create business sustainability for  BRI.
The commitment to support the transformation of  BRI, now with eight subsidiaries, will require systematic and orchestrated mobilization of resources.
Digital transformation in BRI aims to make business  processes more efficient, ensuring that BRI is always  on the lead, whereas culture transformation aims to  build meritocracy, a performance-oriented culture.
All individuals and work units in BRI must at least  have KPIs as their compass, design and use the  Bank’s Strategic Initiatives as the map to deliver their targets, and build a culture that is appropriate to meet  those targets.
Amid Covid-19, BRI has responded by  identifying survival strategies for 2021-2022, starting by implementing the business-follows-stimulus principle.
Subsequently, the transformation initiative is aimed to  ensure BRI can robustly grow in the next three years.
The CMT directorate will safeguard and act as the  catalyst of BRI’s strategic initiatives, which support BRI’s role as the Agent of Development.
In this role, BRI  creates economic and social values for the people and  focuses on the micro segment, expanding access to formal financial services.
BRI’s transformation journey  will also focus on new engines of growth, namely  the ultra-micro segment, including micro-payment, CASA and fee-based income, cost control, network  transformation, organizational structuring, and  culture transformation.
To align its business strategies organization-wide, the Bank will need to integrate and  establish clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as well  as the best performance management system.
The CMT Directorate has formulated the BRIvolution 2.0 as a new aspiration that sustains BRI’s transformation  to realize the vision of becoming “The Most Valuable  Banking Group in Southeast Asia” and the “Champion of Financial Inclusion”.
To support the Bank in realizing this vision, the Change  Management (CMG) Division has continued to work  swiftly and effectively In 2020, CMG focused on 12  strategic initiatives and two flagship projects: World Class Wholesale Banking (WCWB) and BRIvolution 2.0.
All activities under CMG were connected to BRIVolution  2.0.
To support the Credit pillar, the CMG oversaw EWS project for the Corporate Segment, sales planning  for medium-sized businesses, digital lending, and the  application of an information system to manage data on state assets recorded off the balance sheet.
To support the Cross Sell pillar to boost fee income,  the CMG was involved in the BRI-X and World Class  Wholesale Banking (WCWB).
Meanwhile, to deliver  the Customer Centricity pillar, the CMG supported projects such as Road to Digitalization, Banking  Service on Demand, and BRI Loyalty Point.
The Create  New Growth Engine pillar was delivered through BRIPhone, and for the Culture & Capabilities pillar the  CMG managed the BRIvolution 2.0 and the Establish  Innovation Management.
These strategic initiatives were the key to the Bank’s successful implementation  of its business strategies.
They were also instrumental  for the Bank to survive the multitude of shifts in the global business landscape, as BRI pursues a goal to be a  leading financial institution in Southeast Asia.
