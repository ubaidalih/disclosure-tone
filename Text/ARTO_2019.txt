Amidst the dynamics of the  economy and global financial markets, the condition of the national financial services sector was well maintained.
MACROECONOMIC REVIEW Global Economy The uncertainty due to the US trade war against its trading partners, especially China which continued and the increasing symptoms of protectionism had resulted in slowing trade and manufacturing production in 2019 which led to a global economic slowdown, including Indonesia.
The slowdown was also influenced by slowing consumption, investment and domestic exports that had not yet recovered.
This slowdown in investment levels was also seen in slowing levels of industrial production and world trade volume.
The global economy going forward is projected to  generally remain in a slowing trend as indicated by the movement of headline manufacturing indicator data from the European and Japanese Zone Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) which is still below the number 50.
In addition, the US and China PMI also move around the threshold of 50.
Therefore, both manufacturing and the real sector going forward is expected to remain stagnant which is made worst by the outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic since January 2020 which has been spreading to many nations.
Terjaganya laju inflasi dengan realisasi 2,7% (YoY) pada  tahun 2019, makin stabilnya pergerakan nilai tukar, dan turunnya indikator defisit neraca transaksi berjalan dan Indonesian Economy The impact of the global economic slowdown was also felt on the domestic economy, but in general macroeconomic stability was still well maintained and the Indonesian economy grew steadily above 5%, i.
e. 5.02% (YoY) in 2019 compared to 5.17% in 2018, supported by household consumption, and private investment, with inflation levels maintained at the specified target range and adequate foreign exchange reserves.
For the record, Indonesia’s economic achievements was relatively better compared to other emerging market countries, for example China slowed from 6.6% (YoY) to 6.1% (YoY) while India had also fallen sharply from 7.0% (YoY) ) to 6.1% (YoY).
Business players’ perceptions of Indonesia’s economic prospects are also increasingly reflected in positive opinions from the Sovereign Credit Rating Rating Agency, high market confidence based on a Bloomberg survey that places Indonesia at the highest rank among emerging market countries for investment purposes in stock and debt instruments.
Although the indicators are well maintained, what still needs special attention is external performance, where export and import growth has dropped significantly.
Stable macroeconomic conditions were also reflected in  movements in the Rupiah exchange rate which appreciated against the USD with lower volatility compared to 2018.
Historically, Rupiah movements throughout 2019 were in the range of Rp13,919 to Rp14,525 per USD.
Meanwhile Rupiah movements throughout 2018 were in the range Rp13,289 up to Rp15,238 per USD.
Indicators of the trade balance and the current account  balance are relatively better because of the decline in imports.
The trade balance in the December 2019 period recorded a deficit of USD0.03 billion, down compared to December 2018 deficit of USD1.1 billion.
Meanwhile the current account deficit narrowed from 2.9% of GDP in 2018 to 2.7% of GDP in 2019.

In the second semester 2019, BI has reduced the benchmark interest rate (BI 7 Days Reverse Repo Rate or BI 7 DRRR) by 100 bps from 6.0% to 5.0% In addition to lower interest rates, macroprudential policy  was taken to encourage bank credit growth by loosening the loan to value/financing to value ratio of 5-10% on average for home and vehicle ownership, loosening the provisions, Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) to 84-94%, from 80-92% previously, as well as expanding bank funding, including prudent foreign loans above 1 (one) year.
Due to outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, BI has revised  its projection of Indonesia economic growth in 2020 from 5.0-5.4% to 4.2-4.6% in March 2020.
OVERVIEW OF THE BANKING  INDUSTRY Amidst the dynamics of the economy and global financial  markets, the condition of the national financial services sector is well maintained.
The banking intermediation performance, although moderated, is generally still in a solid condition with healthy credit growth and risk level being maintained.
In line with banking performance, non-bank financing can grow gradually with a fairly stable risk.
In general, the resilience of commercial banks in absorbing risk is still quite solid with the level of banking capital adequacy ratio (CAR) in December 2019 still quite high reaching 23.40% supported by the ratio of credit quality (Non Performing Loan/NPL) gross remained low reaching 2.53% (gross) and 1.18% (net).
In line with domestic economic growth, loans grew 6.08%  (yoy) and third party funds grew 6.54% (yoy) compared to the previous year.
This had an impact on tightened liquidity as shown by liquid asset ratio and loan to deposit ratio (LDR) which remained tight.
Liquid asset rate was at 15.51% while LDR was at 94.43% at end of 2019, slightly changed from 14.96% and 94.78% in 2018.
In line with its revised projection for slower economic  growth in 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemy, Bank Indonesia has also revised its projection for banking industry’s loans growth in 2020 from 9-11% to 6-8%; the growth will  Bank Artos Laporan Tahunan 2019 70 Laporan Manajemen Management ReportAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Kilas Kinerja Performance Highlights Profil Perusahaan Company Profile menjadi 6-8%, yang didukung oleh pertumbuhan DPK  sebesar 6-8% juga.

The position of Bank Artos in the National  Banking Industry Bank Artos is a small BUKU 1 bank (a bank with total  equity less than Rp1 trillion) with total assets representing only 2% of total assets of BUKU 1 banks.
The benchmark in term of market share and performance against its BUKU 1 peer group and the banking industry as a whole is shown below:  Compared to its BUKU 1 peer group and banking industry  in 2019, it can be seen that Bank Artos has a very high capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 148.3%, much higher than the peer group and industry average which was in the range of 23-25%.
The high CAR is a result of capital injection in form of capital deposits fund from the new controlling investors at end of December 2019 as part of early rights issue process.
