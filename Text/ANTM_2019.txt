BUSINESS CONTINUITY  The Company is confident of its business continuity despite the commodity price volatility experienced in 2019 for both nickel, gold and coal that continues to loom.
The volatility is caused by weakening demand triggered by the global economic crisis as well as continued increase in the level of global commodity reserves.
The Company has a diversified customer base and does not merely depend on one market or country thereby effectively mitigating volatility.
The Company’s business continuity is also protected with natural  hedging by increasing the non-nickel and non-gold portfolio (bauxite and coal).
Moreover, the Company is also allowed to carry out risk mitigation by hedging transactions with the main objective of protecting its revenue budget.
The Company believes that the best way to manage risks of  declining commodity prices is by reducing production costs.
The Company has a commitment to convert Industrial Diesel Oil and Marine Fuel Oil sources with a cheaper fuel source such as natural gas, coal or hydro power.
The Company also manages its capital to safeguard the ability  to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Through its ability to continuously control and maintain  exposure to commodity prices, markets as well as various risks, the Company believes that its business continuity remains solid.
