Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk206 Jump    Higher  for  the Country Economy and   Industry Overview  Optimism for a strengthening in the global and domestic economy in 2022 was reflected in various projections by  institutions amid uncertainty due to the new variant of the COVID-19 virus, the world energy crisis that triggered  rising inflation, as well as concerns about an aggressive increase in global interest rates.
Global Economy The economy during the COVID-19 pandemic began  with health problems and then spread to all parts of  life, both social and economical.
The rapid spread of  COVID-19 cases dragged the global economy to the  brink of recession in 2020.
To improve this situation,  many countries simultaneously introduced health and  economic recovery programs, including social restriction  policies, population vaccination programs, fiscal budget  stimulus, monetary stimulus by lowering interest rates  and quantitative easing policies, and relaxing policies in  the financial sector, and others.
Prior to the surge in COVID-19 Delta variant cases, the  world was very optimistic about a global economic  recovery in 2021.
The rapid progress of the vaccination  program, especially in Indonesia’s trading partner  countries in the Q4 2020, led to an increase in community  mobility and an easing of normal economic activities.
In  Q2 2021, there was an economic recovery in countries  with largest GDP (Gross Domestic Product), such as:  China’s economy grew positively by 7.9%, the United  States economy grew by 12.2%, the European Zone  grew by 14.3% and Japan grew by 7.5%.
The Indonesian  economy also grew by 7.07% in Q2 2021.
Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk207 Jump    Higher  for  the Country2021   PerformanceManagement   ReportCompany   Profile Capital & Risk  Management PracticesGood Corporate  GovernanceSocial & Environmental  ResponsibilityESG   CommitmentFinancial   StatementsManagement Discussion and Analysis  on Company Performance The momentum for global economic recovery in the first half of 2021 was restrained by an explosion of COVID-19  Delta variant cases.
In the period between October 2020 to early April 2021, the trend of increasing new cases of  this variant was mainly seen in Europe and North America.
Cases then started to emerge in Asia (India) and this had  a significant effect on the increase in new cases in the period after June 22, 2021, not only in Asia but also in North  America and Europe.
Many countries again started to implement restrictions on community mobility/lockdowns.
The impact of this surge in the Delta variant cases led to economic growth in major countries in Q3 2021 falling  compared to Q2 2021.
In Q3 2021, China’s economic growth slowed to 4.9%, the United States 4.9%, the European  Zone 3.9% and Japan grew by 1.2%. 2019 2017 2020 2018 2021-P 2021-P5,55,3 4,9 -2,1 -3,1 -3,4 -4,56,5 5,6 4,84,8 4,6 3,83,6 3,75,9 2,5 2,3 2,85,04,4 3,9 3,1 1,7Emerging & Developing Countries ASEAN-5World Advanced Economies The International Monetary Funds (IMF), in their October 2021 report revised down the global economic projection  from the previous release in July 2021 from 6% down to 5.9%, while the global economic projection for 2022 remained  at 4.4% dari perkiraan sebelumnya.
In 2021, the projected economic growth for the Advanced Economy Countries will be 5.0%, lower than the IMF’s  projection in July 2021 of 5.6%, but still much higher than the economic growth in 2020 of negative 4.5%.
The ASEAN-5  economy is estimated to grow by 3.1% lower than the previous forecast of 4.3%, but still higher than the realized  growth in 2020 of negative 3.4%.
The US economy is projected to grow 5.6%, down from the previous projection of  7%, but well above the realized economic growth in 2020 of negative 3.5%.
China forecast for economic growth in  2021 declined from 8.1% down to 8%, but still higher than the economic growth in 2020 of 2.3%.
Japan revised down  its 2021 economic growth forecast from 2.8% to 1.6% although it is still far above the 2020 growth of negative 4.8%.
Meanwhile, the IMF raised its 2021 economic growth projection, especially in Emerging & Developing Countries from  6.3% to 7.2%, against the economic growth in 2020 of negative 2.1%.
The Eurozone economy was estimated to grow  from 4.6% to 5.2%, well above the economic growth in 2020 of negative 6.6%.
After the Delta variant spread was controlled, the world  was again shocked by an emerging new COVID-19  virus variant called Omicron.
In early November 2021,  laboratory technicians at Lancet Laboratories, Pretoria,  South Africa, discovered an unusual feature in the samples  they were testing for the coronavirus.
This discovery  coincided with a surge in positive cases of COVID-19 in a  number of regions in South Africa.
In Gauteng Province,  where Johannesburg, South Africa is located, less than  1% of residents tested positive in early November 2021,  but the figure rose to 6% in a matter of two weeks.
The  emergence of the Omicron variant has raised global  economic uncertainty.
The acceleration of global economic recovery was  also overshadowed by the energy crisis, especially in  China, India and Europe.
The increase in demand after  the recovery of community activities and economic  activities that exceeded the availability of production/ supply capacity triggered a surge in oil prices followed  by increases in global coal and CPO prices.
World oil prices touched their highest level of USD83.6 per barrel  in October 2021, far above the December 2020 price  of USD48.6 per barrel.
Likewise, coal prices reached a  peak level in September 2021 at USD203.9 per metric  ton from the December 2020 position of USD79.3 per  metric ton.
The world CPO price reached its highest  level in November 2021 at USD1,348 per metric ton from  USD1,016 per metric ton in December 2020.
Another issue that affected the global economy in  2022 was the Fed’s tapering off policy.
At the FOMC  (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, Wednesday  November 3, 2021 The FED officially announced a  tapering policy starting mid November 2021 for USD15B  (USD10B US Treasury and USD5B Mortgage Backed  Securities) every month until mid-2022, or for at least  8 months (current position USD80B treasury, USD40B  Mortgage Backed Securities).
The FED stated that this  was only a preliminary plan and may change depending  on developments and the US economic outlook.
The Fed’s  statement was proven, when on December 15, 2021 the  FOMC meeting decided to accelerate the tapering by 2  times from the previous USD35B.
The Fed is committed to other accommodative policies.
The Fed said it would be more patient before raising  interest rates, but would take steps if needed to control  inflation.
Analysts predict that the Fed’s benchmark  interest rate increase will only occur in the second  semester of 2022 or after the completion of the tapering  process in mid-2022, however, the Fed’s statement that  Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk209 Jump    Higher  for  the Country2021   PerformanceManagement   ReportCompany   Profile Capital & Risk  Management PracticesGood Corporate  GovernanceSocial & Environmental  ResponsibilityESG   CommitmentFinancial   StatementsManagement Discussion and Analysis  on Company Performance US inflation is not transitory (US inflation in November 2021 was 6.8%), raises speculation the Fed will raise interest  rates sooner than expected.
At the FOMC meeting on December 15, 2021, the majority of Fed members projected a  3 times increase in the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) in 2022 to 1%, then 3 more increases in 2023 to 1.75%.
The recovery of community and economic activity due to COVID-19 to reach pre-COVID-19 activity levels was predicted  to continue until the end of 2022.
World concerns over the spike in the third wave of COVID-19 cases due to a new  virus variant, the Fed’s tapering off policy, and the US and China economies not yet solidifying, an energy crisis that  can trigger high inflation and the forecast for an increase in interest rates are all risk factors for global uncertainty in  2022.
Nevertheless, the world is optimistic that there will be a global economic recovery acceleration in 2022, thanks  to the rapid progress in vaccinations, increasing community mobility and economic activity returning to normal.
Indonesian Economy Situation 5.07 5.17 5.02 2.97 -5.32-3.49-2.19-0.717.07 3.51 3.69 2019 2017 Q1-2020 Q1-2021 Q2-2020 Q2-2021 Q3-2020 Q3-2021 Q4-2021 Q4-2020 2018Indonesian Economic Growth (yoy) The surge in the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant  virus and the Emergency PPKM/Level 4 policy in July 3,  2021, also hampered the national economic recovery.
On  an annual basis (year on year), the Indonesian economy  in Q3 2021 grew by 3.69% (yoy), lower than the growth in  Q2 2021 of 7.07% (yoy), but still higher than the economic  growth in the Q1 2021 (-0.71% and 3.51% YoY).
Based on the quarter to quarter period, Indonesia’s  economic growth was also recorded getting a slowdown  from the third quarter of 2021 by 1.55% to 1.06% in the  fourth quarter of 2021.
The largest business sector contribution in 2021 is still  dominated by 3 business fields, namely: Processing  Industry (19.25%), Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  (13.3%) and Trade (13%).
Based on annual growth (yoy), the Health Services and  Social Activities business sector became the sector with  the highest growth at 10.46% followed by Information and  Communication (6.81%), Electricity and Gas Procurement  (5.55%), and Utilities Procurement (4.97%).
Meanwhile, the business sectors with the lowest growth  year on year included: Government Administration,  Defense and Mandatory Social Security at -3.3% and  Education Services at -0.11%.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, the highest quarter to  quarter growth was in the Government Administration  business field, which grew 22.2%, while the lowest was  in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries business field,  which was negative 19.46%.
In terms of expenditure, Indonesia’s GDP in the Q3 2021  was still supported by household consumption at 54.42%,  and investments at 30.81% that together contributed  85.23% of Indonesia’s GDP in Q3 2021.
All components of GDP Expenditure at the end of 2021  grew positively, continuing the positive performance  achieved in the previous quarters.
Indonesia’s Export  Component was able to grow exponentially at the  level of 29.83% (YoY) and was the GDP Expenditure  component with the highest growth rate after Import  growth of 29.60% (YoY).
The lowest growth, namely  the Consumption component of Non-Profit Institutions  Serving Households (LNPRT) grew by 3.29% (YoY).
Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk210 Jump    Higher  for  the Country On a quarter to quarter basis in Q3 2021, Government  Consumption became the component with the highest  growth reaching 33.0% while goods and services imports  experienced the lowest growth or contraction of -0.71%.
The high growth in government consumption is the  realization of the national economic recovery package  to maintain the performance of the national economy  due to the Delta virus variant.
Indonesia’s GDP growth in 2021 by Island has various  variations.
Maluku and Papua islands grew by 10.9% (YoY)  with a contribution of 2.49% GDP, followed by Sulawesi  Island (5.67% YoY growth, 6.89% GDP share); Java Island  (growth 3.66% YoY, share 5.789% GDP); and the islands  of Sumatra and Kalimantan (3.18% YoY growth, 21.70%  share and 8.25% GDP).
In October 2021, the Indonesian PMI Manufacturing  Index recorded a record high during the 2020-2021  period, at 57.2, after previously contracting in July 2021  to an index level of 40.1 due to a spike in Delta cases.
Meanwhile, during Q4 2021, there was a downward trend  in the Manufacturing Index even though it was still in an  expansion phase, after peaking in October 2021, then  decreasing in November 2021 by 53.9 and December  2021 by 53.5.
The impact of the Delta variant was also responded to  negatively by consumers as reflected in the Consumer  Confidence Index (IKK) that entered a pessimistic phase  in July, August and September 2021.
However, in October  and November 2021 the IKK re-entered the optimistic  phase of 113.4 and 118.5 after the spread of the Delta  variant virus started to be controlled.
The positive performance of Indonesia’s exports exceeded  imports resulted in Indonesia’s trade balance showing  a surplus since May 2020 in line with the recovery in  demand from major trading partner countries, such  as China, the US, Japan, India and Malaysia.
However,  the economic rebalancing conditions occurring in the  Bamboo Curtain country should be watched, considering  China’s position as Indonesia’s main export market with  a share of 22% of Indonesia’s total exports in November  2021.
Indonesia’s trade balance surplus could decrease,  especially with the policy of temporarily stopping coal  exports by the Government of Indonesia for the period  January 1-31, 2022 in order to ensure the availability of  domestic coal supply for PLTU (Steam Power Plants)  and national industrial needs, in accordance with DMO  (Domestic Market Obligation) provisions.
Investments in Indonesia continue to grow in line with  the domestic economic recovery due to the pandemic.
The Implementation of Emergency/Level 4 Community  Activity Restrictions (PPKM) Policy in Q3 2021 had  quite an impact on investment performance in the  July-September 2021 period.
In Q3 2021, Indonesia’s  investments reached Rp216.7 trillion, growing by 3.7%  (yoy) or lower than investment growth in Q2 2021 of  16.2% (yoy).
In the midst of the ongoing COVID-19  pandemic, Indonesia’s investment realization throughout  2021 managed to reach Rp901.02 trillion, higher than  the government’s target of Rp900 trillion or grew 3.8%  from the previous year.
Although overshadowed by uncertainty due to the new  COVID-19 variant, energy scarcity, the upward trend in  inflation rates and the possibility of an increase in global  interest rates, many institutions are optimistic that the  Indonesian economy in 2021 will grow positively in a  projected range of 3.2% - 4.7%.
and will strengthen further  in 2022 in a range of 5.0% - 6.5%.

Successful handling and controlling of the COVID-19  pandemic through the PPKM Level 1 to 4 program  and the acceleration of the vaccination program.
An estimated endemic occurrence in Indonesia in  2022 as 70% of the population will be vaccinated will  encourage a national economic recovery acceleration; 2.
Increasing community mobility and economic activities  starting to return to normal;  3.
The performance of Indonesia’s manufacturing industry  entering an expansion phase;  4.
The global economic recovery mainly influenced by  the COVID-19 pandemic control, and vaccinations of  the population; 5.
The recovery in global economic demand and rising  commodity prices have boosted Indonesia’s export  performance, and they continue to improve and have  even experienced a trade balance surplus since May  2020;  6.
Structural reform efforts to increase investor  confidence and ease of doing business to attract  foreign investment; 7.
Global Events in Indonesia in 2022, such as: G20  Summit Presidency, MotoGP, and others;  8.
Support for counter cyclical fiscal policy, including  the continuation of the National Economic Recovery  (PEN) program as well as accommodative monetary  and financial policies.
The optimism for strengthening Indonesia’s economic  recovery in 2021 and 2022 is also supported by Indonesia’s  economic fundamentals performance: 1.
The upward trend in annual inflation is still maintained  at Bank Indonesia in a target range of 3+1%.
In  December 2021 inflation stood at 1.87% (yoy), October  2021 at 1.6% (yoy), September 2021 at 1.6% (yoy) and  August 2021 at 1.59% (yoy).
The inflation rate in 2022  is still in the BI target range of 3+1%; 2.
Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves in November  2021 stood at USD144.95 billion, an increase compared  to USD135.9 billion in October 2021.
The foreign  exchange reserves is equivalent to financing 8 months  of imports or 7.8 months of imports and servicing  Government external debt (ULN); 3.
Exchange rate fluctuations were relatively maintained  with triple intervention efforts in the form of Rupiah  intervention in the spot market, DNDF and bond  purchases by Bank Indonesia.
Throughout 2021 the  Rupiah exchange rate per US Dollar was maintained  in the range of Rp 14,000-15,000 per 1 USD; 4.
The BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) stayed  low at 3.50% or the same level since February 2021 to  support the national economic recovery momentum.
Bank Indonesia is looking to maintain the benchmark  interest rate in the range of 3.5%-4% in 2022; 5.
Performance in 2021 APBN realization was good.
State revenue from taxation exceeded the target with  Rp1,546.5 trillion or 107.1% of the 2021 APBN target.
Likewise, the budget deficit has improved, at 4.65%  of GDP or lower than the target of 5.70% of GDP, as  well as the 2020 state budget deficit of 6.14% of GDP.

As of  December 2021, banking deposit growth was 7.69% (yoy).
This indicates an increase in the level of public confidence  to invest their funds in other investments, such as in the  capital market and property sector.
Throughout 2021, the  Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) recorded an increase in  the Composite Stock Price Index (JCI) of 10.08 percent  year to date (ytd), with a closing at the level of 6,581.48,  compared to the same period last year of 5,735.46.
The  growth of the Real Estate sector in 2021 continues to  experience an increasing trend.
In the third quarter of  2021, the Real Estate sector grew by 3.94% or an increase  compared to the growth in the first and second quarters  of 2021, which were 0.94% and 2.82%, respectively.
Meanwhile, loan growth began to move positively in line  with increased economic activities and the recovery of  businesses’ confidence in future economic conditions.
As  of September 2021 loan growth accelerated away from  the contraction zone, growing by 5.24% (yoy) higher  than loan growth in August (4.82% yoy) and July 2021  (3.24% yoy).
Loan quality (NPL) as of September 2021 was 3.0%,  a slight improvement from 3.2% in August 2021.
The  Financial Services Authority (OJK) decided to extend  the relaxation period for loan restructuring until March  31, 2023.
This decision helped to maintain banking  stability and the performance of debtors in COVID-19  restructuring, which has begun to improve.
The banking industry still has free liquidity.
The Loan  to Deposit Ratio (LDR) in September 2021 stood at  78.9%, lower than 79.1% in August 2021.
The LDR trend  has decreased from 93.4%, its position at the end of  January 2020.
The downward trend in banking interest rates will continue  until 2022 at a limited pace, supported by ample banking  liquidity conditions in line with the national economic  recovery momentum and projections of rising global  interest rates.
In response to the projected trend of  increasing the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) interest rate, Bank  Indonesia’s policy in 2022 is projected to be pro-stability  to support pro-growth.

On the other side, an  increasing trend of loan risk should be watched out for,  especially in the following sectors: Fisheries; Mining &  Quarrying; Processing industry; Construction; Wholesale  and Retail Trade; Provision of Accommodation & Food  & Drink; and Real Estate, Rental Business & Corporate  Services.
Although uncertainty still looms over the global and  domestic economy, the banking industry is optimistic  for an accelerated economic recovery in 2022 given the  strong national economic fundamentals, the formulation  of fast and effective policy synergies by the Government  and Authorities supported by the DPR, as well as the  Government and the community success in handling &  controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bank Loan growth  in 2022 is estimated to be in the range of 7-9%, with  Deposit growth at the level of 6-7%.
Business Prospects During the COVID-19 pandemic, several sectors/business  fields were affected and experienced a downward trend in  growth, however, there were also sectors that continued  to grow positively during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Based on GDP data (YoY) according to business fields  in 2020 and 2021, there are sectors that continue to  grow during the pandemic, including: Agriculture,  Forestry & Fisheries business fields; Water Supply,  Waste Management, Waste & Recycling; Information  & Communication; Financial Services & Insurance; Real  Estate; Health Services & Social Activities; and Education  Services.
Businesses experiencing contractions, especially in  2020, included: Mining & Quarrying business fields;  Processing industry; Electricity and Gas Procurement;  Construction; Transportation & Warehousing; Provision of  Accommodation and Food and Drink; Company Services;  and Other Services.
Along with the national and global economic recovery,  several sectors experienced a positive rebound in 2021,  such as: Mining & Quarrying business field; Processing  industry; Electricity & Gas Procurement; Construction;  Wholesale & Retail; and Financial Services & Insurance.
The business field which is still experiencing a YoY  contraction in 2021 is only experienced in Government  Administration as deep as negative 0.33% (YoY).
This  shows that the government’s policy direction is capable  of navigating the previously corrected economy.
Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk214 Jump    Higher  for  the Country Strategic Policies In 2021  BNI 2019-2023 CORPORATE PLAN REVISION The COVID-19 pandemic created extraordinary conditions that impacted all industrial sectors.
These impacts included: 1.
Economic downturn.
When the COVID-19 Pandemic hit most of the world’s  regions, several world institutions such as the World  Bank, IMF, S&P, Fitch, revised their projections for global  economic growth which were negatively corrected in  2020.
In national conditions, the Indonesian economy  also experienced a negative correction.
The decline  in the economy was the impact of an imbalance in  economic demand and supply due to the lockdown  policies in various regions of the world.
The economy has been improving since early  2021, supported by the mass vaccination program.
With the vaccination program, it is hoped that the  community will gain herd immunity to COVID-19, so  that community mobility will return to normal. 2.
Banking industry conditions The economic downturn had an impact on the banking  industry.
One of the significant impacts was an increase  in banking risk, especially loan risk (NPL).
The increase  in loan risk was followed by a decrease in the demand  for bank loans.
This was due to businesses experiencing  difficulties due to decreased demand, as well as cash  flow difficulties in paying loan installments due to non- current business ventures or even business closures.
The decline in demand for loans was inversely  proportional to the condition of Third Party Funds  (DPK) that increased due to a downward trend in  public consumption.
This resulted in a decrease in the  Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) in the banking system,  which resulted in a higher cost of funds (CoF) for  banks.
The increasing CoF followed by a decrease in  loan demand resulted in pressure on banking NIM.
This  decline was also stimulated by a gradual reduction in  interest rates that were projected to remain stable at  around 3%.
The pressure on banking NIM, followed by an increase  in credit risk, resulted in an increase in reserves for  banking losses, resulted in a significant decline in  banking profits in 2020. 3.
Changes in people’s behavior Restrictions on community mobility, especially in  Indonesia in the form of PSBB and PPKM to suppress  the spread of COVID-19 caused community business  activities to decline.
This encouraged people to make  behavioral changes.
One of the most fundamental  changes was the transaction behavior that changed  from cash to cashless.
Through the “stay at home” policy, people were  encouraged to transact business through digital  channels.
The increasing number of people who used  digital channels encouraged a development of digital  attackers who offered cashless transaction needs and  solutions.
In addition, the consumer loan business trend was  marked by increased distribution in Peer-to-Peer (P2P)  lending.
A few companies responded to the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting or fine-tuning their  strategic directions, including BNI.
BNI reviewed its  previous Corporate Plan and determined that the  strategic directions and financial targets for 2021-2023  were no longer relevant to BNI’s future business, so BNI  needed to adjust it to changes in external conditions.
In this Corporate Plan review, BNI also considered the  fundamental conditions that will affect the direction of  its strategy and goals going forward, such as changes in  the Indonesian banking landscape, the direction of the  Ministry of SOEs, and changes in digital trends.
BNI also  paid attention to several internal conditions that were a  concern for future enhancements and improvements.

Strategic Policy and Transformation  In an effort to support the strategic direction of the 2019- 2023 BNI Corporate Plan Revision and 2021 Strategic  Policy during the COVID-19 Pandemic, BNI needed to  improve and innovate its business processes to answer  several challenges faced in the banking industry through  the BNI Corporate Transformation Program.
Strategic  initiatives in the BNI Corporate Transformation program  were developed by BNI in response to these conditions,  including: 1.
Credit quality improvement The COVID-19 pandemic has indirectly caused debtors  to experience cash flow disruptions, which has created  difficulties in them paying their obligations to the Bank,  so the quality of bank loans deteriorated.
Policies  and business processes were needed to accelerate  and improve the loan quality.
One of BNI’s efforts to  maintain debtor business resilience was through loan  quality management.
To maintain loan quality, BNI  established a LaR Management Optimization Team.
The LaR Management Optimization Team’s focus was  on the management processes, decisions, action plans  and monitoring of LaR debtors.
The LaR Management  Optimization Team also acted as a liaison between  Business as Usual (BaU), which focuses on managing  and maintaining good debt, and Remedial Recovery  (RR) that focuses on repairing non-performing loans  or bad debt.
Through the implementation of the LaR Management  Optimization team, BNI’s credit quality was successfully  maintained and improved.
Until December 2021, BNI’s  Gross NPL ratio improved compared to the end of  2020, from 4.3% to 3.7% or improved by 0.5%.
The  same thing was seen in the LaR ratio (incl.
Covid)  which improved from 28.7% at the end of 2020 to  23.3% of total loans.
With the improvement in credit  quality, BNI established a 17.0% lower loss allowance  compared to 2020. 2.
SME Exporter Hub (BNI Xpora) To move the wheels of the Indonesian economy, the  MSME businesses play an important role in influencing  and controlling the condition of the national economy.
Almost all businesses in the Indonesian economy  (>99%) are MSMEs and they contribute 60.3% of the  state revenue and employment of 97%.
On the other side, BNI received directives from the  Ministry of SOEs to support expansion into international  markets.
To date, the MSME businesses only contribute  towards 14.4% of the export transactions, but has great  potential for further development.
The SME Exporter Hub is BNI’s effort in helping  SMEs to expand their market and access to global  markets.
This is in accordance with the Ministry of  SOEs aspiration for BNI to focus on expanding into the  global market by helping local entrepreneurs penetrate  the international markets.
Through BNI Xpora, BNI assists in providing integrated  financial and non-financial solutions to MSMEs through  3 stages, namely: a.
Go Productive BNI provides solutions to increase MSME  productivity by collaborating with start-ups to  provide business management applications and  digital financial reporting, and by collaborating with  agencies and institutions in mentoring, training to  improve MSME capabilities.
Go Digital BNI helps MSMEs use digital technology for non- cash and advisory transaction solutions through  a multi-channel approach with integrated digital  platform support & digital activation in the form  of telecommunication services and network  connectivity.
Go Global To penetrate the global market, BNI provides  solutions for MSME assistance and development,  special advisory, access to international buyers by  strengthening the role of Overseas Branch Offices  (KCLN).
One way is by partnering with global  e-commerce, tradeclub, and business matchmaking  to bring together MSME as a supplier with the  diaspora as a buyer.

The BNI  Xpora ecosystem development has received high enthusiasm from businesses that  are recommending BNI Xpora services to other businesses.
This positive signal had  an impact on business performance with an increase in export credit in the MSME  segment by Rp2.5 trillion, an increase in low-cost funds by Rp2.2 trillion and an increase  in trade finance by Rp2.3 trillion. 3.
Capital management - Additional Tier 1 Based on performance conditions in early 2021, BNI has capital (especially tier 1 capital)  that is less supportive in conducting business expansion.
BNI’s low core capital ratio  was caused by lower capital growth compared to RWA growth.
Several rating agencies were also concerned about the potential lowering of BNI’s  rating if BNI’s capital was not strengthened.
In general, rating agencies stated that BNI’s  capital condition was at a limit that allowed the rating agencies to correct BNI’s rating.
Optimizing momentum in the global capital market, BNI strengthened its Tier 1 Capital  through the issuance of Tier 1 equivalent securities, tier 1 equivalent, i.
Additional  Tier 1 perpetual bond in quarter 3 of 2021.
This issuance was monumental as BNI was  the first bank to issue this instrument in Indonesia.
Investors were very enthusiastic about BNI’s Additional Tier 1 product, as reflected by  demand that exceeds supply (2.7x oversubscribed).
In addition, BNI also managed to  set a re-bid price with a yield of 4.3%.
The Additional Tier 1 BNI has increased BNI’s  Tier 1 CAR by 140 bps to 17.8% in Q3 2021.
Strategic initiatives in the BNI Corporate Transformation Program included quick win, mid  term, long term, and enabler development.
Strategic initiatives were possible to develop  following the changes in business direction and external conditions and to continue  previous strategic initiatives to achieve BNI’s future goals, so the strategic initiatives  became multi-year and continuous.

Total Domestic  International Business Revenue in 2021 increased by  Rp239 billion, or 9.1% YoY, driven by growth in Fee Based  Income, especially from Trade Finance, and Remittances  and Interest income from the Financial Institutions and  International Desk.
Financial Institutions business revenue on a YoY basis  was quite stable with a growth of 0.8%.
The COVID-19  pandemic did bring a decline in investments in various  sectors in Indonesia.
This resulted in a decrease in  Fee Based Income from BNI’s Financial Institutions  business.
However, the decrease in Fee Based Income  was compensated for by a significant growth in interest  income in the Financial Institutions business, which grew  50% YoY, and was derived from an increase in bank-to- bank financing provided by BNI to correspondent banks.
Remittance activities previously affected by the COVID-19  pandemic showed improvement with an 8.3% increase  in volume to reach USD83.6 billion.
Digitalization of  the remittance process as the main strategy changed  customer behavior to choosing transactions through  digital channels, making transactions easier and more  efficient.

BANK HEALTH LEVEL The Bank’s Health Level (BHL) is the result of the Bank’s risk and performance assessment.
The Bank Health Level  Assessment is carried out using a Risk-based Bank Rating approach both individually as well as on a consolidated  basis.
The Bank’s health level is a means to identify at an early stage the bank’s problems, determine the future  business strategy, formulate and implement corrective action over the Bank’s weakness/problem, provide the basis  for the process of linking capital with risk, as a basis for decision-making as well as to enhance competitiveness.
The Bank’s Health Level serves as a means for determining the strategy and supervision focus on the Bank by the  supervisory authorities.
Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk328 Jump    Higher  for  the Country The Bank’s health level rating is based on 4 (four) factors  as follows: 1.
Risk Profile Risk Profile assessment is conducted by evaluating the  risks inherent in the Bank’s activities and the quality  of risk management implementation on the 8 types  of risk. 2.
Good Corporate Governance Good Corporate Governance assessment evaluates the  quality of the Bank’s management in the application  of Good Corporate Governance principles. 3.
Earnings Assessment of the Earnings factor covers the  evaluation of profitability performance, profitability  sources, profitability sustainability, and profitability  management. 4.
Capital Assessment of Capital covers the evaluation of  capital adequacy and adequacy of capital structure  management.
At BNI, evaluation of capital adequacy  is related to the Bank’s Risk Profile.
Assessment of Bank Health Level is reported to the  regulator (OJK) every 6 months (semesterly) in June and  December.
Bank BNI’s Health Level assessment results  for December 31, 2021 ranked “Healthy” meaning that: 1.
The Bank’s condition is generally healthy, so it is  considered capable of facing significant negative  effects from changes in business conditions and other  external factors.  2.
The ratings for the assessment factors (Risk Profile,  Governance, Profitability, and Capital) are generally  good.
If there are any weaknesses, then in general  these weaknesses are less significant.
PLEDGED ASSETS In the period ending December 31, 2021, there were no  pledged assets of BNI.
IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON BANK PERFORMANCE The BI 7-day (Reverse) Repo Rate (7DRR) benchmark interest rate has been lowered several times by the monetary  authority Bank Indonesia during the COVID-19 Pandemic since early 2020.
The 7DRR benchmark interest rate before  the Pandemic was 5.00% and since the Pandemic started has been lowered several times, to 4.75% in February 2020,  then 4.50% (March 2020), 4.25% (June 2020), 4.00% (July 2020), 3.75% (November 2020), and during 2021 there  was one reduction in 7DRR to 3.50% in February 2021.
The decrease in the 7DRR is to adjust it to the real sector  conditions that experienced contraction in 2020 and slowing growth in 2021, to help the real sector to keep moving.
Inflation in 2021 was recorded at a relatively low level of 1.87% year on year (YoY).
The non-optimal activity in the real sector resulted in low loan demand and high third party deposits in the Indonesian  banking industry.
Bank loan growth up to October 2021 was 3.24% YoY, lower than the loan growth in 2019 (pre- pandemic period) of 6.08% YoY, but better than 2020’s loan growth of -2.41% YoY.
The growth in third party funds  (TPF) as of October 2021 was 9.44% YoY, higher than the growth in 2019 of 6.5% YoY, but lower than the growth  in 2020 of 11.10%.
In the sub-optimal real sector where interest rates were tending to decline, BNI was able to take advantage and  increase its loan expansion.
BNI (Only) loan expansion in 2021 was 4.3% from Rp510.2 trillion in 2020 to Rp532.1  trillion at the end of 2021, higher than the banking expansion until October 2021 of 3.24% YoY.
This loan expansion  saw BNI’s interest income slightly decrease by 4.1% from Rp52.1 trillion during 2020 to Rp50.0 trillion during the 2021.
Overall, efforts to increase interest income through loan expansion and interest expenses efficiencies through increased  low-cost funds resulted in BNI’s 2021 net interest income increasing by Rp4.2 trillion, or 12.4%, from Rp34.0 trillion  in 2020 to Rp38.2 trillion in 2021.
Net Interest Margin (NIM) in 2021 was 4.67%, an increase of 0.17% compared to  the 2020 NIM of 4.50%.

BNI’s interest expenses decreased by 34.9%  from Rp18.1 trillion in 2020 to Rp11.8 trillion in 2021.
The  decrease in interest expenses was higher than the 15.5%  increase in BNI deposits in 2021 from Rp631.6 trillion  in 2020 to Rp729.2 trillion in 2021.
Other than this, the  composition of BNI’s low-cost funds (current account,  saving account/CASA) increased from 68.5% in 2020 to  69.4% in 2021 or up 0.9%.
PRIME LENDING RATE Based on OJK Regulation No. 37/POJK.03/2019  concerning Transparency and Publication of Bank  Reports and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 7/6/PBI/2005  concerning Transparency of Bank Product Information  and Use of Customer Personal Data (State Gazette of the  Republic of Indonesia 2005 Number 16, Supplement to  the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia No. 4475),  Commercial Banks who carry out conventional business  activities in Indonesia are required to report and publish  the Prime Lending Rate (SBDK) in Rupiah.
The prime lending rate implementation aims to provide  clarity to customers and facilitate customers in weighing  the benefits, costs and loan risks offered by the Bank.
In  addition, publication of prime lending rates are intended to improve good governance and promote healthy  competition in the banking industry, among others,  through the creation of better market disciplines.
In addition, the prime lending rate is used as an indicator  of the amount of loan interest rates that will be charged  to customers applying for Bank loans.
Therefore, BNI  updates the prime lending rate in accordance with the  movement of the reference interest rate set by Bank  Indonesia.
In general, the prime lending rate is calculated  based on 3 (three) components, namely the Cost of Funds  for Loans (HPDK) arising from customer fundraising  activities, operating expenses incurred for fundraising  and lending and the profit margin component set by  the Bank in its lending activities.
The prime lending rate  calculation does not take into account the risk premium  component of the debtor, the amount of which depends  on the risk assessment of each debtor.
Thus, the loan  interest rate charged to debtors is not necessarily the  same as the prime lending rate.
BNI is required to report the prime lending rate calculation  to Bank Indonesia on a monthly basis and periodically  publish in the wider media.
The prime lending rate  calculation applies to types of corporate loans, retail  loans, micro loans, and consumption loans (KPR and non- KPR).
However, Bank Indonesia submits the classification  of corporate loans, retail loans and consumer loans (KPR  and non-KPR) based on the internal criteria used by  each bank.
The following is the prime lending rate determined by BNI in 2021: PRIME LENDING RATE PER YEAR PRIME LENDING RATE PER YEAR BASED ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS CORPORATION  LOANS (%)RETAIL  LOANS (%)MICRO  LOANS (%)CONSUMPTION CREDIT KPR (%)NON KPR (%) Prime Lending Rate 8.00 8.25 0.00 7 .25 8.75 Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk330 Jump    Higher  for  the Country FEE BASED INCOME GROWTH ACCELERATION BNI’s fee-based income in 2021 amounted to Rp13.5 trillion, an increase of 10.34% from Rp12.3 trillion in 2020.
The increase was dominated by 4 (four) banking activities including Investment Banking, Syndication, Marketable  Securities dan ATM & E-channel.

This was reflected in BNI’s  ability to fulfill all maturing obligations in a timely manner, both for principal debt or interest expense payments.
The  banking financial ratios to measure BNI’s liquidity and solvency are as follows: Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt (Bank Liquidity) BNI’s ability to meet short-term obligations is carried out by good liquidity management.
To increase short-term  liquidity resilience, BNI maintains adequate liquidity by managing several indicators, including the Primary Reserve  (Minimum Demand Deposit and Cash), Secondary Reserve (Liquidity Reserve), and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  in accordance with regulatory requirements.
LCR is a comparison ratio between High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and the estimated total net cash outflow  for the next 30 (thirty) days in a crisis scenario.
In December 2021, BNI’s LCR reached 230.21% (Bank Only) and  230.69% (consolidated), above the regulatory requirement for minimum LCR fulfillment of 85% until March 31, 2022  or during the banking relaxation period.
TO manage liquidity over a longer time period (1 year), BNI maintained its Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFSR) by  increasing the Bank’s funding stability, adjusted to the composition of assets and off balance sheet accounts.
NSFR  is the ratio of the Available Stable Funding to the Required Stable Funding.
As of December 2021, BNI’s NSFR was  151.76% (Bank Only) and 151.81% (consolidated), above the regulatory requirement for minimum NSFR fulfillment of  85% until March 31, 2022 or during the banking relaxation period.
Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt (Bank Solvency) BNI’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (RWA) and in 2021 it increased  to 19.7% compared to 16.8% in 2020.
This indicates that BNI’s capital structure has the capability to offset loan risk,  market risk, and operational risk, as the ratio is higher than the minimum CAR set by the regulator.

TARGET ACHIEVEMENT IN 2021  Assumptions Used and Process for Setting Targets for 2021 Macro and Micro Assumptions The Government is encouraging an increase in Public Consumption (57.7%), and Investments (31.7%) both of which  contributed significantly to the 2020 National GDP (89.4%).
The COVID-19 Pandemic Control and National Economic  Recovery (PEN) Program in addition to aiming to boost public demand/consumption (demand side) through social  assistance programs (bansos), also encourages the supply side (production & trade) through programs for MSMEs  and Corporations.
The Government is also optimistic that the enactment of the Omnibus Law on Job Creation will attract foreign  investment and encourage the growth of MSMEs, thereby increasing new job opportunities.
Meanwhile, the easing  of Bank Indonesia monetary and macroprudential policies, and the easing of loan restructuring policies by OJK, are  expected to help maintain liquidity and resilience in the banking sector to support the economic recovery and make  it easier for the banking sector to channel both productive and consumptive loans/financing.
The theme for the Government’s fiscal policy for 2021 was Accelerating Economic Recovery and Strengthening  Reforms.
This was at the same time as the momentum to continue and strengthen reforms in various policy aspects  to prepare a solid foundation after Covid 19.
This is instigated to carry out economic transformation towards the  vision of an Advanced Indonesia 2045.
Economic growth is targeted by the Government at 4.5-5.5%.
However, BNI  is more conservative and projecting economic growth in 2021 at 4.0-4.5%.

Economic Growth  The global vaccination programs and budgetary  stimulus in amny countries in the world has boosted  optimism for an economic recovery after the COVID-19  pandemic.
Indonesia’s economic growth is expected  to rebound to pre-COVID-19 growth levels in 2022, in  line with market expectations that the global economy  will recover after the COVID-19 pandemic.
This optimism is caused by the market’s belief in the  effectiveness of vaccinations, which is expected to  suppress the spread of COVID-19 so that herd immunity  is achieved.
With the community being “immune” from  COVID-19, community mobility will return to normal  to encourage economic recovery.
The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed work on several  infrastructure projects that were expected to increase  the attractiveness of foreign investment in Indonesia,  especially for development of processing industries  that produces raw materials, auxiliary materials, capital  goods and finished goods.
By 2023, the end of the second term of President  Joko Widodo’s Government, the current Government  is believed to be maximally mobilizing resources to  encourage increased development growth so as to  leave a good “legacy” to the Indonesian people.
The GDP projection for 2023-2024 will be higher than  GDP growth for 2021-2022 but still within the 5-6%  interval considering that Indonesia’s dependence on  imported goods is estimated to be still quite high.
Indonesia’s imports are mainly dominated by imports  of raw materials, auxiliary materials and capital goods  which are used in the processing industry in Indonesia.2.
Inflation Rate The inflation rate is estimated to increase post- pandemic assuming the COVID-19 pandemic is  successfully controlled.
People are starting to return  to their normal activities.
People’s purchasing power  is increasing, demand is rising more than the speed  of goods and services supply, thus prices are being  pushed up.
The inflation projection was adjusted in line with the  Bank Indonesia and the Government inflation target.
On February 12, 2021, the Government and Bank  Indonesia agreed on five strategic steps to control  inflation.
These are: a.
Maintaining volatile foods inflation in the range  of 3-5%;  b.
Strengthening the coordination of the Central &  Regional Governments in controlling inflation;  c.
Strengthening the synergy between Ministries/ Agencies (K/L); d.
Strengthening national food security by increasing  production through food estate programs & smooth  distribution through optimization of infrastructure;  e.
Maintaining the Government Rice Reserves (CBP).
Synergy policies pursued by the Government and Bank  Indonesia are through various program innovations  aimed at maintaining supply stability and smooth  distribution during the pandemic to maintain Consumer  Price Index (CPI) inflation.
In 2020, CPI inflation was  1.68% (yoy) below the target range of 3.0%±1%.
The low  inflation was influenced by weak domestic demand as  a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and amid adequate  supply.
This meeting also agreed an inflation target for the  next 3 (three) years as a follow-up to the expiration  of the Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) No.  124/010/2017 concerning Inflation Targets for 2019,  Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk337 Jump    Higher  for  the Country2021   PerformanceManagement   ReportCompany   ProfileManagement Discussion and Analysis  on Company Performance Capital & Risk  Management PracticesGood Corporate  GovernanceSocial & Environmental  ResponsibilityESG   CommitmentFinancial   StatementsManagement Discussion and Analysis  on Company Performance 2020 and 2021.
Inflation targets for 2022, 2023 , and  2024 were agreed at 3.0%±1%, 3.0%±1%, and 2.5%±1%,  respectively, to be set later through PMK.
Thsee  inflation targets are expected to anchor the public’s  future inflation expectations, especially their support  for ational economic recovery and structural reforms.
The estimated inflation rate for 2021-2024 is in the  range of 2-4% considering Indonesia’s dependence  on imported goods to support economic growth.
However, starting in 2025 the inflation rate is estimated  to be maintained in the range of 2-3%, as the domestic  industry starts to produce raw material products,  auxiliary materials, capital goods and finished goods  to meet domestic needs.   3.
Rupiah Exchange Rate The 2021 Exchange Rate projection was based on the  latest developments where Indonesia’s Trade Balance  in 2020 showed a surplus of US$21.74 billion after  the deficits in the previous 2 consecutive years of  US$8.57 billion in 2018, and US$3.2 billion in 2019.
The  Current Account Balance (CAB) showed a surplus in  Q3 2020 of US$0.96 billion, the first time since Q4  2011 and throughout 2020 there were improvement  in the CAB deficit compared to previous years.
In the  Q1 2021, Indonesia’s CAB again recorded a surplus  of US$5.53 billion, an increase of 133% from the CAB  surplus in the same period a year earlier.
Capital inflows to Indonesia were due to the Indonesia’s  interest rates that were more attractive than interest  rates in the United States.
Indonesia’s Foreign  Exchange Reserves trend tended to increase to a  position as of March 2021 of US$137 billion, slightly  lower than the previous month’s position of US$138.8  billion, but compared to the position the previous year  (US$114.3 billion) much improved.
Estimates for the Rupiah exchange rate in 2024  refers to the Ministry of Finance 2020-2024 macro  assumptions.
Their projection for the IDR USD  exchange rate is estimated to be stable at a level  of Rp13,500-Rp15,000 with the assumption that  economic growth is stable and reaches the target,  with controlled inflation, stability of crude oil prices,  and increasing value of Indonesian exports, as well as  the adequacy of Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves.
The IDR USD exchange rate in 2025 is estimated to be in the range of Rp12,000 - Rp. 13,000.
In 2025, it  is expected that Indonesia will begin to be free from  dependence on imports, high foreign investments and  foreign tourist visits. 4.
BI-7 Days Reverse Repo Rate (BI-7DRRR) In setting the BI-7DRRR benchmark interest rate,  Bank Indonesia considers the balance between  domestic stability (inflation rate), external stability  (exchange rate) and maintaining the momentum of  national economic recovery.
Bank Indonesia keeps its  benchmark interest rate low until there are signs of an  increase in the inflation rate and the possibility of the  FED starting to increase its benchmark interest rate as  the US economy recovers faster than other countries.
This recovery is in line with the smooth vaccination  process and the addition of greater fiscal stimulus.
The BI-7DRRR 2021 projection was adjusted to the  current BI-7DRRR interest rate at a level of 3.50% in line  with the momentum of the national economic recovery.
On other occasions, BI has always prioritized synergies  to build optimism for economic recovery, both in its  role as a monetary authority and as a member of the  Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK).
The BI-7DRRR in 2023-2024 is expected to increase  in line with the increase in the inflation rate and the  increase in the Fed’s reference interest rate or the Fed  Fund Rate (FFR).
However, BI-7DRRR will return to  the range of 3-4% in 2025 in line with the forecast for  Indonesia’s economic condition to be good. 5.
Loans and TPF Growth Along with the optimism for economic growth after  the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bank loan growth is estimated  to grow positively in 2021, at a conservative single  digit rate, considering the economy is just starting  to recover while the banking industry is still facing  pressure from loan risk.
Loan movements in 2021 were  still dominated by large banks with looser liquidity and  better quality debtor choices.
The Bank’s loan growth is expected to improve in line  with improving corporate performance.
It is estimated  that the Banks will only start to recover to its position  before the pandemic, in 2022, after “herd community”  is achieved, and people’s mobility returns to normal  as before the pandemic.
Annual Report 2021   >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk338 Jump    Higher  for  the Country TPF growth in 2021 is estimated to be higher than loan growth, even though the Bank’s deposit interest rates still  trend lower.
People still save a lot of their funds in banks, as reflected in the high growth of Third Party Funds  (TPF).
In the future, the Bank will seek to optimize low-cost funds to obtain efficient cost of funds and encourage  commission income, supported by digital banking transactions.  2021 Business Expansion Target Achievement  BUSINESS EXPANSION (Bank Only)2021 REALIZATION (RP TRILLION)2021 TARGET (RP TRILLION)ACHIEVEMENT OF 2021  TARGET (%) (1) (2) (1:2) Loans disbursed 581,5 585,0 99.4 Deposits From Customers 729,5 652,5 111.8 Current Accounts 281,7 230,6 122.2 Savings 224,7 212,5 105.7 Time Deposits 223,1 209,4 106.6 BNI’s success in formulating strategies was reflected in the business expansion target achievement shown in lending  and raising TPF.

The issuance of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Perpetual  Non-Cumulative Capital Securities where BNI became the first bank in Indonesia to issue Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments had a positive impact on strengthening BNI’s capital.
BNI’s success can also be seen in the quality management of its productive assets.
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) were  below the set targets.
This shows BNI’s strong commitment to continuous maintainence in the quality of its assets.

In addition to the efficiency  strategies, the lower investment in education and training  was the result of using more efficient and cost-effective  online education and training models.

The Bank’s  business plan is as follows: (Bank Only, in trillion Rupiah) PERFORMANCE  INDICATORS (Bank Only)PROYEKSI 2022 Credit Growth (%) 7%-10% NIM (%) 4.6%-4.8% Cost of Credit (%) 2.0%-2.3% NPL (%) <3.5% CIR (%) <43.0% The financial projections in the 2022 RBB were realistic  with a relatively challenging growth rate in an effort to  achieve economic recovery due to the pandemic caused  by Covid-19.

TRANSFER PRICING DOCUMENT Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) No. 213/PM.03/2016 concerning Types of Documents and/or Additional  Information that Must Be Stored by Taxpayers Conducting Transactions with Parties with Special Relationships, and  Procedures for Management.
This regulation intends to improve the quality of documents prepared by taxpayers and increase transparency.
Taxpayers also need to be more proactive and ensure that the information needed to prepare master documents  and local documents is available in order to comply with the provisions in accordance with applicable regulations.
PT Bank Negara Indonesia, Tbk (BNI) as a taxpayer who obeys and complies with all existing tax regulations and has  complied with these regulations.

This new TP rule complements  the provisions related to the application of the principle  of fairness and common business practice in transactions  involving related parties.
Based on the definition in Article 1 Paragraph 6 PMK- 213/PMK.03/2016 it is stated that the transfer pricing  document is a document held by the taxpayer as the  basis for applying the principle of fairness and common  business Practices in determining the transfer price  carried out by the Taxpayer.
This regulation was issued in connection with the  provisions for transfer pricing documents, and did not  replace the applicable regulation to regulate the principle  of fairness and common business practices, namely  DJP Regulation No.
PER-43/PJ/2010 as last amended  by DJP Regulation No.
PER-32/PJ/2011 concerning  the Application of Principles of Fairness and Common  Business Practice in Transactions Between Taxpayers  and Related Parties.
Types of Documents That Must be Maintained Based on these regulations, taxpayers are required  to maintain and keep 3 (three) levels of documents  consisting of: 1.
Local Documents; and 3.
Reports by Country.
The aforementioned transfer pricing document must be  submitted in Indonesian.
However, taxpayers who have  obtained permission to keep books in foreign languages  and currencies other than Rupiah can produce documents  in English accompanied by transfer pricing documents in  the Indonesian language.
Subjects Required to Prepare Transfer Pricing  Documents Parties that are required to make Transfer Pricing  Document can be grouped into 2 (two), namely: 1.
Those who are required to produce master documents  and local documents; and 2.
Those who are required to produce master documents,  local documents and reports per country.
Regulation Impact on the Bank In terms of implementing regulations related to Transfer  Pricing, BNI has disclosed transactions with subsidiaries  and other related parties in accordance with applicable  regulations.
In terms of evaluating arms length transactions  or the reasonableness of BNI transactions with related parties,  the Bank uses the services of a Tax Consultant, PT.
Multi Utama  Consultindo (MUC), to conduct an assessment.
Based on the  assessment results, all transactions conducted by BNI with  related parties have met the specified fairness requirements.
ACCESS TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION  FOR TAXATION PURPOSES Preliminary The Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information  or (AEOI) is a G20 countries’ plan and was initiated by the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) regarding a system that supports the exchange  of taxpayer account information between countries.
With this system, taxpayers who have opened accounts  in other countries will be tracked directly by their home  country’s Tax Authorities.
AEOI has a new global standard  that will help reduce the chance of avoiding tax payments.
The AEOI work system is the exchange of financial data  of foreign nationals living in a country.
The exchange of  financial data is not done arbitrarily, but rather is carried  out between the tax authorities in each country.
Every  country that has joined the AEOI system will send and  receive pre-agreed information every year without having  to submit special requests.
In Indonesia itself, with the presence of AEOI, the  Directorate General of Taxes can supervise and explore  potential taxation through banking transactions or other  financial institutions conducted by taxpayers abroad and  developed it so that it applies to taxpayers in the country.
This is done to strengthen the database which so far has  limited access so that it is expected that the potential  of state revenue from the tax sector can be maximized.

All of these can be achieved with the support of a talent development system,  a capability development system, and appreciation for the contributions that have been made with the support of  leadership and technology as the main infrastructure.

The three main components  in the framework include: 1.
Talent Life Cycle, like a Ferris wheel symbolizing the employee life cycle starting from talent attraction to talent  separation, Human Capital policies including talent attraction, talent acquisition, culture, performance, career &  development, rewards, retention, to talent separation; 2.
Business Partner, like a stick showing the role as a business partner bringing Human Capital policies to each of  their managed units as part of their role as a strategic partner; 3.
Leadership is the force that drives the Ferris wheel, showing that each leader is a Human Capital Leader who  assures the human resource management policies.
In line with the corporate transformation initiative, HC management is also carried out by preparing a Human Capital  management blueprint aligned with the Bank’s strategy to encourage sustainable transformation success.
The HC  Blueprint is part of BNI Transformation and consists of Strategic Directions, Programs, and Enablers that support  BNI’s HC Architecture.
