The Agribusiness Group recorded total sales of  Rp17.77 trillion in 2022, a decrease of 10% from Rp19.69 trillion in 2021, primarily due to lower sales of EOF products which was partly offset by higher ASP of palm products.
Total sales value of the Distribution Group increased by  24% to Rp6.23 trillion in 2022 from Rp5.02 trillion in 2021 due to an increase in Indofood Group and third-party product sales.

The increase in total current assets was mainly due to a higher inventory level corresponding to higher commodity prices offset with lower cash and cash equivalents as a result of retention payment related to PCL acquisition paid in April 2022, while the increase in total non-current assets was primarily attributed to an increase in fixed assets in relation to capacity expansion.

Solvency The Company’s financial position continued to be healthy and manageable even though total funded debt increased to Rp66.06 trillion from Rp61.78 trillion as at end of 2021 mainly due to increase in Rupiah value from the USD bonds as a result of Rupiah depreciaton.

In April 2022, the Institute of Indonesia Chartered  Accountants’ Accounting Standard Board (DSAK IAI) issued an explanatory material through a press release regarding attribution of benefits to periods of service in accordance with PSAK 24: Employee Benefits which was adopted from International Accounting Standards (IAS) 19: Employee Benefits.
