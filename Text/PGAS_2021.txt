The global economy continues to improve in 2021, despite being uneven with continued financial market uncertainty.
World economic growth in 2021 has accelerated in line with economic recovery in developed countries, which is strongly supported by accelerated vaccination and enormous policy stimulus.
Meanwhile, economic growth in developing countries in general continues to improve, but not as quickly as the recovery process in developed countries.
In general, the business climate in 2021 is better, but it’s not as good as it was expected to be because of the COVID-19 pandemic’s delta variants, which slowed down the pace of business improvement.
Domestically, the process of national economic recovery is  proceeding steadily with the goal of maintaining stability.
Domestic economic recovery in 2021 continued to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta variant in Indonesia in the third quarter of 2021 slowed the country’s economic recovery.
Economic performance improved at the end of 2021, supported by continued mobility growth, in line with the acceleration of vaccination and easing of COVID-19 spread, the opening up of broader sectors of the economy, continued policy stimulus, and strong export performance.
As a result of these developments, Indonesia’s economic growth in 2021 increased by 3.69%, higher than in 2020, when growth contracted by 2.07%.
With this positive momentum, the company continues to expand  by expediting the process of acquiring new customers and also by exploring synergy opportunities with other business entity to shape better Indonesia’s natural gas business climate.
Of course, this is not without challenges.
The gas business, which is becoming increasingly regulated and provides limited space for development, requires the company to further enhance its role as an national aggregator of infrastructure and natural gas commodities by applying the principles of effective and selective use of costs and investments so as to be able to continue to increase the company’s business growth.
Running a more agile business and pursuing value creation were important parts of the company’s strategy in 2021.
In terms of industry, 2021 remained a challenging year for downstream natural gas business.
The increase in spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the highest level in history was caused by the LNG global market situation, which was over demand, while supply conditions are less reliable due to several LNG projects that have been hampered onstream due to the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions to some existing LNG liquefaction globally.
Looking forward, the global market situation is expected to improve in terms of supply in 2022 as a result of the start-up of several global liquefaction projects.
The addition of new supplies will lower global LNG prices, which will encourage the LNG industry to grow even more.
PGN has taken several strategic steps in response to the situation,  including strengthening its position as an LNG trader in the global LNG market, utilizing the Arun LNG Hub for international LNG trading activities and meeting the LNG ex-regasification gas needs of Aceh and North Sumatra, and developing LNG infrastructure to meet domestic LNG needs, such as the Teluk Lamong LNG Terminal, which can serve as a facility for developers of LNG retail businesses in East Java and the Cilacap LNG Terminal for the needs of Cilacap RU IV Refinery and surrounding industries, and optimizing the utilization of FSRU Lampung.
In 2022, PGN Group will commence initiatives for the construction of mini LNG plants, including JTB mini LNG plants and other regional options, in anticipation of the retail LNG sector’s anticipated growth.
Additionally, PGN received an assignment from the government via PT Pertamina (Pesero) as an Oil and Gas Holding to gasify PLN plants using LNG supplies.
The LNG facilities for PLN plants have the potential to be the primary gateway to the development of the local gas market.
Additionally, PGN embodies the spirit of “One Energy, One  Pertamina.
” As powerful force.
PGN brings together the company’s efforts and activities in the field of energy and turns them into one powerful force.
PGN divides its operations into three main business segments for management’s interests: (1) Trading & Transmission Business Segment, (2) Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Business Segment, and (3) Other Operating Business Segments, which include telecommunications, gas processing, oil transportation, pipeline construction and pipeline maintenance, as well as facility management and asset management services.

The estimation of oil and gas reserves, as well as changes in  global oil prices, affect the calculation and bookkeeping of impairment and the reversal of impairment.
PGN records oil and gas properties, which comprise exploration and evaluation, as well as oil and gas properties.
The company evaluates whether there are indications of asset  value impairment at the end of each reporting period/year.
If there are indications of asset impairment during the asset impairment testing process, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset formally.
The recoverable amount for an individual asset is the greater of  the asset’s fair value or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) value less costs of sale or its value in use, unless the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
If the carrying value of an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) exceeds the recoverable value, the asset is considered impaired and the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable value.
When determining value in use, the estimated net future cash flows  are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and asset specification risk.
When determining fair value less costs of sale, the most recent market bid price is used, if available.
If no such transaction occurs, the company determines the asset’s fair value using an appropriate valuation model.
Multiple valuations or available fair value indicators corroborate this calculation.
At the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made to determine whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in the previous period/year no longer exists or has decreased.
If any indication is discovered, the entity estimates the asset’s or  CGU’s recoverable value.
Pada Desember 2020, Perusahaan kalah atas sengketa PPN the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the  asset have changed since the last impairment loss was recognized.
In this case, the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable value.
The reversal is limited to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its recoverable value or its carrying value, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss has been recognized for the asset in the preceding period/year.
A profit or loss is recognized on the reversal of an impairment loss.
Following the reversal, the asset’s depreciation is adjusted in the following years so that the asset’s new value, minus any residual value, is spread out over its useful life.
In 2021, there was no impairment in oil and gas exploration  assets, compare to USD3.3 million in previous year.

According to the Directorate General of Taxation (DGT), PGN’s natural gas is a processed gas that adds value to goods, subjecting them to 10% VAT, and PMK-252/PMK.011/2012 is a one-time exception that applies only on December 28, 2012.

S-470/WPJ.19/KP.0307/2009 dated August 19, 2009, confirming that the natural gas sold by PGN is a mining-produced item exempt from VAT.
PGN has filed legal efforts in this dispute until the Tax Court grants the appeal, but the Director General of Taxes has filed an extraordinary legal effort in the form of a judicial review with the Supreme Court.
The dispute in 2013 was triggered by the determination of the  selling price of PGN natural gas in 2 (two) units of currency (USD/MMBTU and Rp/m 3) starting in 1998.
DGT considers bills  in units of Rp/m3 to be a replacement for services that are the  VAT object and has issued a bill for 2013 to 2017 amounting to Rp4.71 trillion.
PGN has explained that bills in USD/MMBTU and Rp/m 3 units  are natural gas prices that are not subject to VAT.
PGN has also  received the Director General of Taxes’ confirmation, No.
S-2/PJ.02/2020, dated January 15, 2020, that the activities of flowing natural gas (distribution) are categorised as delivery of natural gas flowed through pipelines that are not subject to VAT.
Furthermore, the DGT granted entirely the application of objection submitted by PGN for SKPKB VAT on distribution services for the 2014–2017 Tax Years, with the total value of SKPKB canceled at Rp3.8 trillion.

Pada 2021, PGN menetapkan target pelaksanaan program pelatihan inhouse kompetensi teknis sebanyak 44 program, The volume of natural gas trading management is below target due to external factors, particularly unplanned maintenance at gas supplier ConocoPhillips Grissik Ltd (CPGL), suboptimal production at PHE Jambi Merang following maintenance, ineffectiveness of PJBG CPGL ex RU II Dumai transferred to fulfill the lifting of WK Rokan, a decrease in the ability to supply PHE WMO and KEI gas, and the absence of LNG trading realization in 2021.
To meet PLN’s energy needs as a result of the decline in CPGL  supply, PGN collaborated with PLN to optimize the Lampung FSRU in order to realize TUA through the use of PLN’s LNG.
TUA 29 BBTUD is realized.
Thus, the total volume of gas traded is 900 BBTUD (871 BBTUD + 29 BBTUD), or 101.9% of the target volume of gas traded (883 BBTUD), or 96.8% of the total volume of gas traded (930 BBTUD).
ANALYSIS ON REALIZATION OF PROFIT/LOSS In 2021, net revenue was USD3,036.1 million, or 94.1% of RKAP 2021.
This was primarily due to the fact that the volume of natural gas trading operations and oil transportation remained below target.
However, by implementing TUA PGN, additional revenue can be optimized.
With the increase in ICP and PGN’s ability to complete the Pangkah project on time, PGN’s business of lifting oil and gas receives optimal revenue.
On the other hand, PGN can achieve revenue and operating cost  efficiency through innovation and improvement, allowing costs to be realized under the RKAP 2021.
Cost realization reached USD2,449 million, or 91.3% of RKAP 2021.
Additional profit from exchange rate differentials, tax reversal, and increased profit share of subsidiaries/affiliates all contribute to a net income of USD304 million in 2021, or 129.5% above the RKAP target.
ANALYSIS OF ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMAN  RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT REALIZATION To accomplish the vision mission and support PGN’s role as a gas  sub-holding, PGN continues to enhance comprehensive employee development programs that are consistent with in-house education and training programs as well as public training, certification, and knowledge sharing.

Participation of employees in development programs reached 98%, which exceeded the target of 82.5%.
PROJECTION OF THE NEXT ONE YEAR Macro Assumptions The COVID-19 pandemic, which has paralyzed economic  activity worldwide, has even pushed several countries, including Indonesia, into recession.
The pandemic prompted the government to impose restrictions on a variety of activities, from tourism to education, which had a significant economic impact.
Bank Indonesia, on the other hand, was optimistic that economic growth would resume on a positive trend in 2021 and keep going in 2022.
Indonesia’s central bank forecasts economic growth of 5.0% to 5.5% in 2022.
This means that the national economy will start to grow again in 2022, after the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the government’s 2022 work plan (RKP), efforts to  rehabilitate the economy will be focused on two primary pillars: first, the recovery of purchasing power and businesses; This, however, will be significantly influenced by efforts to alleviate the health crisis, particularly the COVID-19, and second, the recovery of the business world, the preservation of household purchasing power, and the acceleration of infrastructure development, particularly labor-intensive infrastructure projects.
This economic growth optimism is based on a strengthening  trend of economic recovery.
Numerous leading indicators are continuing to rise.
The index of consumer confidence is already at a high level (above 100).
The index of retail sales continues to rise.
For the sixth consecutive month, the manufacturing PMI expanded.
Industrial and commercial electricity consumption has continued to improve and grow in a positive direction.
K/2020 tentang Penugasan Pelaksanaan Penyediaan Pasokan dan Pembangunan Infrastruktur Liquified Natural Efforts to handle pandemics and mass vaccination are expected to control the rate of addition of positive cases of COVID-19 and accelerate the realization of herd immunity in the first quarter of 2022.
Thus, socioeconomic activity is expected to continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels.
For the successful handling of COVID-19 and economic recovery,  it is expected that community and industrial activities will gradually return to normal so as to have a positive impact on energy consumption in general and natural gas energy in particular.

Bank Indonesia forecasts that the global economy will expand  at a rate of approximately 4.4% in 2022.
Meanwhile, global financial markets remain uncertain in response to emerging risks, including the increased spread of COVID-19’s Delta variant, market anticipation of the Fed’s tapering policy, and concerns about longer-lasting inflationary pressures caused by supply chain disruptions and energy constraints.
In addition, the spread of the Omicron variant, which makes things more uncertain, must be closely monitored.
Domestically, the Indonesian economy is expected to expand even  faster in 2022, in line with improving domestic demand and the maintenance of external stability, inflation control, and a sound financial system.
The national economy will accelerate in 2022 as a result of increased mobility in response to the more controlled spread of COVID-19 and the acceleration of vaccination, as well as the opening of additional priority sectors in conjunction with the optimization of the Financial System Stability Committee’s (KSSK) integrated policy package, as well as the government’s fiscal policy stimulus and the Bank Indonesia policy mix.
Bank Indonesia forecasts that Indonesia’s economic growth will reach 4.7%-5.5% in 2022, in line with the acceleration of private consumption and investment, as well as continued government fiscal spending and exports.
As PGN assesses, the business prospects for 2022 and beyond  are still very wide open.
Natural gas will be the energy transition to renewable energy.
The conversion of coal, fuel, and LPG to lower emissions will continue in 2022.189 Laporan Tahunan 2021 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara TbkTATA KELOLA PERUSAHAAN Good Corporate GovernanceTANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL DAN LINGKUNGAN PERUSAHAAN Corporate Social and Environmental Responsiblities Dari sisi market global, tahun 2022 akan lebih baik dari sisi  supply dengan onstream-nya beberapa proyek liquefaction global.
Globally, 2022 will be a better year from a supply standpoint, with several global liquefaction projects onstream.
The addition of new supply will lower the global price of LNG and encourage the LNG industry to continue growing.
PGN has taken several strategic steps in response to this situation,  including strengthening PGN’s position as an LNG trader in the global LNG market, utilizing Arun Hub LNG for international LNG trading activities and meeting LNG ex-regasification gas needs for the Aceh and North Sumatra regions, and developing LNG infrastructure to meet domestic LNG needs, such as the Teluk Lamong LNG Terminal, which can serve as a facility for retail LNG business developers in the Java region, and the Cilacap LNG Terminal, which will serve the RU IV Cilacap Refinery and surrounding industries while also optimizing the Lampung FSRU’s utilization.
In addition, PGN will also initiate initiatives for the construction of  a mini LNG plant in 2022, such as the JTB mini LNG plant, as well as other regional options, in anticipation of the retail LNG sector’s anticipated growth.
Additionally, PGN, as the Oil and Gas Subholding, was assigned by the government, via PT Pertamina (Pesero), as the Oil and Gas Holding, to gasify PLN’s power plants using LNG supply.
The LNG facility for the PLN power plant may serve as the primary gateway for the development of the local gas market.
As a gas subholding that integrates natural gas infrastructure  in Indonesia, PGN is optimistic that it can achieve an increase in natural gas trading management of around 1,037 BBTUD in 2022 and continue to increase to reach 1,293 BBTUD in 2026.
With the decreasing volume of gas supply from the existing gas  supply pipeline, starting in 2023, it is projected that the supply of LNG will be fulfilled to meet the growing domestic demand.
Demand is still anchored by the industrial sector (refinery and  smelter) and retail, followed by the electricity sector.
Additionally, the household sector contributes to the growth of gas customers in accordance with the assignment target of 1 million household connections (SRT) per year until 2026.
PGN has prepared several strategic steps to address future challenges and business development efforts that span all energy potential in the gas sector, particularly in Indonesia.
The goal is for PGN to be dominant not only in the midstream sector, which includes infrastructure and natural gas distribution, but also throughout the natural gas value chain, from upstream to downstream.
LNG INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT In order to meet the needs and expand the use of natural gas in the territory of Indonesia, gas distribution infrastructure continues to be developed, not limited to pipes.
LNG infrastructure is the main alternative to serve the fulfillment of natural gas in several demand centers spread mainly in Central Indonesia and Eastern Indonesia.
Mastery of technology and supply-chain aspects is one of the  main foundations for developing LNG infrastructure in order to improve infrastucture connectivity that is reliable, safe, integrated and fulfills economic aspects.
Technology contributes to the effectiveness and optimization of  infrastructure development without neglecting reliability or safety, while the flexibility of determining supply chain schemes based on supply and demand locations by optimizing logistics costs.
Based on the outlook for increased demand for clean energy,  PGN will always strive to expand its LNG business on a large and small scale to meet domestic and international needs.
Utilization of LNG Terminals in Arun and Bontang as LNG  Hubs creates value in the form of LNG storage services for a certain period of time, LNG bunkering facilities for domestic and international ships, LNG logistics centers for power plants and smelters spread across Central and Eastern Indonesia, and point centers for pipeline and non-pipeline network system integration.
Currently, PGN is also taking the initiative to develop LNG  bunkering, which aims to provide LNG as ship fuel using the Direct Berthing (Jetty Modification) and Ship to Ship Transfer (LNG Bunkering Vessel) transfer schemes.
With the market development plan in the Southern Java Region and further development of gas distribution to households, there are several initiatives to develop gas distribution modes not only through gas pipes but also LNG.
There are several initiatives to explore the market in the Southern Java Region through the development of retail LNG through the LNG liquefaction plant in the Semarang Region as well as the utilization of Teluk Lamong Terminal.
In addition, there are 6 gas potentials that can be utilized for  the development of the Mini LNG Plant, which is stranded gas from the Sengkang, Meruap, Salawati, and Donggi Matindok M52 fields.
EXPANSION OF THE NATURAL GAS MARKET PGN will expand its business into the natural gas utilization sector in order to increase the value of natural gas utilization.
The opportunity being explored is the use of natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation and smelters.
With the issuance of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources  Decree No. 02/2022, on the assignment to Pertamina Group to carry out the supply and development of LNG infrastructure for PLN power plants as listed in the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 02/2022.
In this case, PGN, as the gas subholding, has an important role in providing supplies to 33 PLN power plants with a total capacity of 1,198 MW and a total gas demand of 83.47 BBTUD.
Meanwhile, Indonesia’s smelter industry’s development is  massive.
Maluku) are development priorities to supply raw materials for the industrial ecosystem of electric vehicles (battery).
The potential energy demand in this industry is for electricity generation and for existing generators whose engines have been converted to dual fuel engines (MFO-Gas).
Total gas demand is expected to reach up to 20 BBTUD.
CITY GAS DEVELOPMENT To support the government’s program to reduce LPG imports, PGN will expand the use of natural gas in the household segment, with a target of 4 million customers by 2024.
This activity is part of the Gas Kita Pintar program.
In the future, apart from building the gas pipeline independently, PGN also plans to partner with a business entity to develop this City Gas.
