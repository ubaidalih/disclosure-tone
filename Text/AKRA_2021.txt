With strict health protocols the Company has  continued its business operations in 2020 and 2021  and has managed to record consistent growth.
The  main factors in this achievement were: 1.
The Company trades essential goods needed in  the midst of a pandemic. 2.
Business model-based risk control. 3.
Complete logistics & supply chain infrastructure  from upstream to downstream. 4.
The IT system monitors the movement, inventory,  and status of the product.
Various measures and efforts have been in deployment  globally, including in Indonesia, such as expediting  the distribution of vaccines to create herd immunity,  restrictions and enforcements in health protocols,  enlargement of COVID-19 testing coverage, and  various economic and tax relaxations by the Indonesia  Government to lessen the impact on corporations in  Indonesia.
The extent of such measures taken by the Government  to eradicate the COVID-19 threat, including those  taken globally, cannot be estimated at this moment  for the economic and social environment.
The impact on the Group’s performance in the future  cannot yet be estimated, however, the management  has been and continues to closely monitor its  operations, liquidity and resources, and is actively  working and taking various measurements to minimize • PSAK No. 48: Penurunan Nilai Aset, tentang ruang  lingkup penurunan nilai aset dan menghapus  perbedaan dengan IFRS pada IAS 36 paragraf  04(a).
