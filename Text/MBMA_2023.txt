Selain melayani  permintaan global terhadap baterai kendaraan listrik, Indonesia has one of the largest reserves of nickel  in the world.
According to the US Geological Survey,  Indonesia is home to the world’s largest nickel reserves,  standing at 21 million metric tons.
Based on the 2022  performance evaluation report of the Geological  Agency, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, it  is recorded that the amount of nickel ore reserves and  resources in Indonesia is estimated at 5.03 billion tons  of reserves (Proved & Probable) and 17.33 billion tons of  resources (Measured, Indicated & Inferred).
Nickel is a key mineral in electric vehicle (EV) batteries,  which are part of the global clean energy transition.
As  a country with large nickel reserves, Indonesia is well  positioned to benefit from the growing demand for  nickel.
Although nickel prices declined in 2023 due to  oversupply, long term demand for nickel are expected  to accelerate, as critical minerals in the transition  to clean energy.
In addition, closure of various nickel  mines around the world suggest that prices will  strengthen as supply drops.
Based on the International Energy Agency (IEA), the  shift to clean energy will increase the demand for nickel  in the global market, particularly for environmentally  friendly vehicles that use electric batteries.
By 2040,  global sales of EV will reach to 94 million vehicles,  increasing by 327% from sales in 2023 of 22 million  vehicles.
According to Wood Mackenzie, batteries could  account for 28% of global nickel demand by 2030 and  37% by 2040.
As such, the Indonesian government has pushed to  develop the EV value chain domestically, starting with  a ban on exports in nickel ore which subsequently   stimulated investment in the Indonesia nickel space,  especially in downstream business, which is seen  as having enormous potential.
Since 2020, nickel  ore exports have been banned as the country seeks  to develop its downstream nickel industry.
has ambitions to be an EV production hub, targeting  300  thousand EV cars and 2.5 million electric  motorcycles by 2030.
The government has also  established IBH (Indonesia Battery Holding) in 2021 to  manage the battery industry ecosystem.
In addition, nickel is an important component in the  stainless steel production process.
The growth of  Indonesian nickel production in the stainless steel  sector is projected to increase at a CAGR of 3.7%  to reach 8.2 million tons in 2040.
Wood Mackenzie  estimates that demand for nickel from the stainless  steel industry will increase by 779 kt in 2023 to 2024 ,  which represents a CAGR of 1.9%.
On the supply side, the implementation of a ban on  nickel ore exports from Indonesia starting in 2014 has  limited supply on the market, especially in China, for  nickel ore which has no natural substitute products  available on the market.
Thus, MBMA Group sees promising growth  opportunities to participate in the expansion of clean  energy and stainless steel-related sectors.
The  Company holds a portfolio of high quality assets in the  nickel battery materials value chain located in Central  and Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia.
This ambitious path of growth is in line with the  Indonesian government’s push to build and develop  the Electric Vehicle (EV), battery value chain and  industry in Indonesia, and also enables the Company  to participate in global energy transition long term, for  which EV batteries are a critical part.
Starting with acquiring control of the SCM Mine as a  source of nickel-rich ore to downstream processing  and refining processes, MBMA has assembled a  vertically integrated chain of nickel mining and refining  through a series of  acquisitions in 2022-2023.

Mining Assets MBMA Group owns the following mining assets as of  31 December 2023: Sulawesi Cahaya Mineral Mine (SCM Mine) MBMA Group has a 51.0% interest in SCM Mine, which  began commercial operation in 2023.
SCM is a global- scale, high-quality, and low-cost mining operation  spread across a 21,100 hectare concession.
SCM Mine is one of the largest nickel laterite resources  globally, containing approximately 13.8 million tonnes  of nickel and 1.0 million tonnes of cobalt.
The SCM  Mine has rich limonite nickel ore resources, with the  right mix of limonite ore (77%) and saprolite ore (23%).
Limonite ore is highly suitable for the production of  Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) through HPAL  plants, which can then be converted into nickel  sulfate for use in EV battery production.
The large resources owned by the SCM Mine secures  the supply of nickel manufacturing raw materials  for downstream operations for many decades, and  attract partnership opportunities by generating  significant production volumes and long-term cash  flow stability.
The SCM Mine supplies saprolite ore to MBMA Group’s  RKEF Smelters (CSID, BSID and ZHN), to be further  processed into NPI in Indonesia Morowali Industrial  Park (IMIP).
Whereas SCM Mine’s limonite ore is sold to  HPAL plants to produce MHP, which can be converted  into nickel sulphate for EV battery materials  production.
MBMA Group expects that the SCM Mine will provide a  sufficient and stable ore supply for MBMA Group RKEF  Smelter and HPAL projects for several decades.
Saprolite ore was  sold to RKEF Smelters amounted to 2.1 million wmt and  limonite ore sales of 0.9 million wmt was sold to HNC’s  HPAL plant.
Average sales price in 2023 was US$33/wmt for  saprolite ore and US$17/wmt for limonite ore.
The price  of limonite ore and saprolite ore that MBMA Group sells  is based on the Mineral Ore Benchmark Price formula,  which is derived from the London Metal Exchange  (LME) nickel price.
Stockpiled ore that has not been sold at the end of the  year and therefore have not been recorded as sales  revenue was as follows, the stockpiles to be sold in the  following year:  84 PT Merdeka Battery Materials Tbk • Laporan Tahunan 2023Prolog PrologueIkhtisar Kinerja Performance HighlightsLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company ProfileAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Perkembangan Segmen Pertambangan di 2023 SCM mengirimkan bijih saprolit pertamanya ke Smelter  RKEF milik Grup MBMA di IMIP pada bulan Agustus 2023.
Mining Sector Developments in 2023 SCM delivered its first saprolite ore to MBMA Group’s  RKEF Smelters at IMIP in August 2023.
While, delivery  of limonite ore to HNC’s HPAL plant commenced in  December 2023.
Infrastructure construction at SCM, related to haul  road upgrade has completed, it has approximately 20  km in length, links the SCM’s IUP boundary to BDM’s  haul road, which is approximately 30 km to IMIP.
The  combined haul road also can be used to connect mining  tenements adjacent to SCM Mine to IMIP in the future.
SCM has signed an agreement with BDM to use its haul  road.
SCM also continues to improve site infrastructure  to support mining operations, including developing  extensions and enhancements to the haul road  connecting the SCM Mine to IMIP, mine site roads, FPP  and ore haulage infrastructure, fuel storage and camp  facilities.
Further exploration continues to take place in SCM,  using resource definition drilling activities.
Performance of the Manufacturing  Segment Per 31 December 2023, the manufacturing segment  recorded revenue of US$1,312.04 million and profit for  the year of US$61.53 million.
Revenue increased by over  2 times, while profit for the year rose by 54.70% compared  to 2022.
This increase was driven by the acquisition of a nickel  matte converter, full year results from the CSID and BSID  RKEF Smelters, and the commencement of commercial  operations of the ZHN RKEF Smelter in July 2023.
Manufacturing Assets The Company owned the following operational assets in  the manufacturing segment as of 31 December 2023: •  RKEF Smelters  MBMA Group has a 50.1% interest in three RKEF  Smelters within IMIP, two of which have been  producing Nickel Pig Iron (NPI) from saprolite ore  since 2019 and early 2020, which are PT Cahaya  Smelter Indonesia (CSID) and PT Bukit Smelter  Indonesia (BSID), both located at IMIP, each of with  an aggregate nameplate production capacity of  19,000 tpa NiEq.
A third smelter, PT Zhao Hui Nickel (ZHN), began  operating in the second half of 2023,  with a  nameplate capacity of 50,000 tpa NiEq in NPI.
The RKEF Smelters generally take in saprolite ore  with a grade of between 1.6% and 2.0%.
The grade  of nickel ore feed is an important determinant of  NPI production.
Since the CSID and BSID RKEF Smelters  commenced production, production volumes have  remained consistent, with both smelters operating  at a utilization rate of more than 100%.
ZHN RKEF  Smelter reached a utilization rate of 91% by the end  of 2023.
•  HNMI Nickel Matte Converter  On 31 May 2023, MBMA Group completed the  acquisition of 60% interest in PT Huaneng Metal  Industry (HNMI) located within IMIP, a high-grade  nickel matte (HGNM) conversion facility which  began operating in early 2022 with a 50,000 tpa  NiEq capacity located in IMIP, Central Sulawesi.
HNMI processes the low-grade nickel matte by  reducing the iron content to produce HGNM,  containing more than 70% nickel.
Nickel matte is an intermediate product that is used  to produce nickel sulphate, an integral component  of the battery materials value chain.
Nickel matte  can also be further refined to obtained pure nickel  metal.
Production and sales of nickel matte enables  MBMA Group to capture additional profit margins  from producing and selling a downstream product  which is a key feedstock for battery precursors and  Class 1 nickel.
The Company is building additional projects in the  manufacturing sector as follows: •  Acid Iron Metal Project (AIM Project)   In December 2022, the Company subscribed all new  issued shares by PT Batutua Pelita Investama (BPI)  equivalent to 66.38% ownership.
In January 2023,  MBMA Group, acquired all BPI’s shares owned by  MDKA and PT Batutua Abadi Jaya (BAJ) equivalent to  33.62% ownership, therefore owned 100% effective  ownership in BPI.
BPI is the company owning 80%  ownership in PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia (MTI)  as the operator of the AIM project.
The ore is processed to become  valuable other products such as producing multiple  products including sulphuric acid, saturated steam,  iron ore pellets, pure copper, lead-zinc hydroxides,  gold and silver doré.
The AIM Project, which located in IMIP, Central  Sulawesi, has a nominal capacity of 1.2 mtpa acid  and steam.
This location places AIM Project adjacent  to future acid and steam off-takers including HPAL  plants, which will serve downstream players of  the EV battery value chain.
In the future, demand  for acid products produced by the AIM Project is  expected to increase significantly in line with plans  to build additional HPAL plants in Indonesia.
•  High-Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL)    MBMA Group is developing multiple HPAL processing  plants in partnership with leading global battery  material companies.
The HPALs will process limonite  ore from the SCM Mine to produce Mixed Hydroxide  Precipitate (MHP), a precursor material to the EV  battery industry.
The main advantage of the HPAL process are its  cost effectiveness and ability to rapidly leach nickel  and cobalt from lateritic ores.
Other processes such  as RKEF typically only treat saprolite laterite ore.
A summary of the HPAL process is as follows: • ore is mined and crushed to create a fine material; • this fine material is mixed with water to create a  slurry which is then preheated; • this hot slurry is pumped into an autoclave (a giant  pressure cooker of sorts) where sulfuric acid is added; • the slurry and sulfuric acid then react as they  flow through several compartments within the  autoclave; • the slurry takes approximately 60 minutes to  complete the leaching process in the autoclave; Annual Report 2023  • PT Merdeka Battery Materials Tbk 87 Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTanggung Jawab Sosial dan Lingkungan Perusahaan Corporate Social and Environment Responsibility • pada saat meninggalkan autoclave bertekanan dan  bertemperatur tinggi, lumpur harus dikembalikan  ke kondisi atmospherik; dan • proses ini diselesaikan melalui dua atau lebih proses  pencucian.
• upon leaving the high pressure and temperature  atmosphere of the autoclave the slurry must be  returned to atmospheric conditions; and • this process is completed through two or more  washing processes.
Once the slurry reaches  atmospheric conditions, it is washed and separated  at which point the nickel and cobalt can be  recovered from the liquid fraction.
MBMA has entered into the following HPAL partnerships  to date: - CATL  Starting in March 2023, MBMA Group signed a term  sheet with Ningbo Brunp Contemporary Amperex  Co.
, an affiliate of CATL (CATL) regarding the  development of an HPAL plant with a nameplate  capacity of 60,000 tonnes per annum of nickel in  MHP.
MBMA Group will own a 66% economic interest  in this project, with 34% owned by CATL.

Nickel matte performance in above table is the performance since HNMI Nickel Matte Converter is acquired by the Company in May 2023.
MBMA Group recognised revenue  from HNMI since the acquisition in June 2023.
Production costs are mainly attributed to the purchase  of low-grade nickel matte (LGNM) with the remainder  consisting of other materials, electricity, labor and  supporting capital.
HNMI used LGNM as main raw  materials based on agreement at the prevailing NPI  price plus a small margin.
Sales for the year reached 28,129 tonnes at average  selling price of US$15,592 per tonne and a cash cost of  US$14,755 per tonne.
Nickel matte revenue reached US$438.60 million, with  profit amounting to US$14.48 million in 2023.
Manufacturing Segment Development in 2023 The Company added nickel processing production  capacity in May 2023 with the acquisition of the HNMI  nickel matte converter, as an important element in the  plan to create a vertically integrated operation.
Subsequently, the Company’s RKEF Smelter capacity  to produce NPI increased as the ZHN RKEF Smelter was  commissioned in June 2023, adding substantial NPI  production capacity.
In operating its RKEF Smelters,  MBMA Group’s partnership with the Tsingshan Group  has delivers significant cost savings related to its  vertically integrated operations within IMIP, as well as  other optimizations and efficiencies as a result of the  supply of logistics, utilities, including access to port  facilities, and power and consumables required to  operate the RKEF Smelters in IMIP.
With regard to the AIM Project, the Company focused  on constructing a concentrator for extracting pyrite  concentrate, an acid plant, chloridising roasting  plants, and a metal extraction plant.
the year, construction for the pyrite and acid plants  were substantially complete, and construction was  ongoing for the chloride plant.
In parallel, MBMA  Group has made operational preparations such as  recruitment and training of operations personnel,  formal risk assessment with key safety, operational  and construction personnel, securing and first  delivering operational reagents and consumables, and  developing proactive maintenance management.
The first acid train is expected to start production and  ramp up to full capacity during second quarter of 2024,  with the commencement of the second acid train and  chloride plant also expected in second quarter of 2024.
As such, the AIM Project is on track to commence  operations in 2024.
The first shipment of pyrite ore  from the Wetar Copper Mine was already received in  September 2023.
As of year-end, a total of 30,000  tonnes of pyrite ore has been delivered from Wetar to  the AIM Project, ready to be processed when the AIM  Project begins operating.
GEM HPAL construction also made progress.
The HPAL  project will be constructed and commissioned in two  stages on a “turn-key” basis.
Stage one will have a  nameplate capacity of 20,000 tonnes per annum of  nickel in MHP, and stage two will increase the nameplate  capacity to 30,000 tonnes per annum of nickel in MHP.
Stage one and stage two target commissioning dates  are the end of 2024 and mid-2025, respectively.
The others segment recorded revenue and profit of  US$4.02 million and loss of US$21.28 million in 2023,  compared to no revenue and a profit for the year of  US$22.33 million in 2022.

All MBMA Group business activities take place in  Indonesia.
In the midst of the global economic  slowdown, Indonesia’s economic growth remains  high.
Data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS)  shows that Indonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  grew by 5.05 % (yoy) in 2023 with an inflation rate  reaching 2.61%.
This growth is in line with the growth  projections submitted by Bank Indonesia for 2023,  which ranged from 4.5% to 5.3%.
This high economic  growth was supported by increased domestic demand  from (i) household consumption which grew along  with controlled inflation; (ii) growing Government  consumption is mainly driven by expenditure by Central  Government and Regional Government employees;  and (iii) increased investment driven primarily by  improvements in non-building investment.
MBMA Group believes that MBMA Group’s business  activities have and will continue to benefit from the  global shift in favor of electric motor vehicles and will  drive strong battery demand.
Nickel is one of the main  ingredients in making electric motor vehicle batteries.
The main properties of nickel include high strength  and ductility, low thermal conductivity, resistance to  corrosion and oxidation, ferromagnetism, and catalytic  properties that make it suitable for use in battery  manufacture.
The increasing use of Li-ion batteries to  power electric motorized vehicles will be an important  component of future nickel demand.
According  to Wood Mackenzie, nickel demand for batteries is  expected to reach 28% of total nickel demand before  2030 and reach 37% before 2040.
Given these dynamics and having set the stage for  growth in 2023, MBMA Group believes that its long- term business prospects are solid and that it will be able  to meaningfully participate in opportunities related to  the clean energy transition which is unfolding globally. 112 PT Merdeka Battery Materials Tbk • Laporan Tahunan 2023Prolog PrologueIkhtisar Kinerja Performance HighlightsLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company ProfileAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Perbandingan antara Target dan  Realisasi Tahun 2023 Comparison of Targets and Realization in 2023 Target tahun 2023 secara umum terealisasi sesuai  dengan rencana strategis Perseroan, termasuk target  produksi serta akuisisi aset strategis untuk menjadi  bisnis pertambangan dan pengolahan nikel yang  terintegrasi vertikal.
