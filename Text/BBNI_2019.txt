The United  States and China have, in the process of negotiating an agreement to resolve the trade war, agreed to not impose additional import tariff increases that initially was supposed to be applied on December 15, 2019.
This compromise was achieved following China’s commitment to increase purchases of US agricultural products amounting to US$200 billion.
Geopolitical tensions shifted between the US and Iran following the shooting of the supreme commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard by a US drone at Baghdad Airport, Iraq.
President Trump recently stated that he will withdraw from Iran.
However, in view of the tense geopolitical climate between the US and China (brought about by the US’ “attention” towards the demonstrations in Hong Kong) and US-Iran as well as the close relations between Russia with Iran has led Iran to constantly seek to pursue a response.
Global economic growth for 2019 and 2020, as revealed  by the World Bank in October 2019, is projected to be lower than initially projected in June 2019 (January 2020: 2.4% & 2.5% compared to June 2019: 2.6% & 2.7%).
The downward correction in the world’s GDP projection is based on weak global trade volume brought about by the Trade War.
The World Bank projects 2020 global GDP will be higher than in 2019 (2019: 2.4% vs 2020: 2.5%).
This increase is based on the World Bank’s assumption of improved international investment and trade.
The World Bank is aware that the low benchmark rate  conditions in 2019 will lead corporations and countries to issue bonds.
The high accumulated level of bond issuances in 2020 can trigger a future financial crisis.
INDoNesIa’s ecoNomy Indonesia’s economic growth (GDP) in the third quarter of 2019 grew by 5.02%.
This Q3 2019 GDP level was increasingly questioned by economic observers, particularly those from abroad, given the absence of a catalyst for Indonesia’s economic growth in the third quarter of 2019.
However, the government clarified that the low import levels had a positive impact on Indonesia’s Q3 2019 GDP .
High imports can reduce GDP while at the same time low imports can positively contribute to GDP .
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Indonesia’s economy was, as usual, more active compared to the previous quarter due to public consumption that increased as a result of the holiday season and Christmas as well as new year.
Nevertheless, consumption seemed relatively stable.
The holiday and shopping appetites in December 2019 were not as large as in the previous year.
MoM inflation in December 2019 (0.35%) was lower compared to the December inflation of previous years.
In terms of exports and imports, Indonesia’s accumulated trade deficit up to November 2019 registered a US$1.3 billion deficit.
Indonesia’s imports increased beyond economist’s expectations in November 2019.
With projected conditions such as relatively stagnant  household consumption and high imports, projected fourth quarter 2019 consensus as compiled by Bloomberg is expected to reach 5% (YoY) or the lowest in 2019 (Q1 2019: 5.07%, Q2 2019: 5.05%, Q3 2019: 5.02%).
Inflation throughout 2019 was registered to be the lowest since 2000 (2.72%).
The government’s decision not to increase electricity and subsidized fuel prices successfully stemmed price increases in 2019.
Bank Indonesia targets inflation of 3%±1 for 2020 or lower compared with the target in 2019 of 3.5%±1.
The government highlights the importance of maintaining public consumption by maintaining inflation to conducive levels.
In the meantime, the economic survey conducted by  Bloomberg projects Indonesia’s inflation to reach 3.5% in 2020 or higher than in 2019 as it is driven by the increase in administered prices.
There are no official announcements to date from the government to increase the basic electricity rates and subsidized fuel prices.
For non-subsidized fuel alone, the government has decided not to increase prices.
If there is no increase in administered prices in 2020,  therefore, it is highly likely that the actual 2020 inflation will be substantially lower than in 2019 as food and foodstuffs (the largest component of inflation) is projected to be low due to favorable rainfall at the end of 2019 and early 2020.
Adequate rainfall will lead to improved harvests and maintain food and foodstuff inflation in 2020.

Moreover, foreign investment to Indonesia, such as through bank acquisitions and investments in digital-based businesses in Indonesia, can potentially increase in 2020.
Projected prices for Indonesia’s mainstay commodities (CPO  and Coal) in 2020 is projected to remain unfavorable or lower than in 2019.
With lower prices and limited demand for its mainstay commodities, Indonesia may likely experience a current account deficit in 2020.
Furthermore, tax reduction policies to attract foreign  investors, can potentially reduce tax income.
Indonesia can potentially obtain lower tax income in 2020 compared to 2019 (fiscal deficit).
The potential for a double deficit may likely occur again in 2020.
Bus INess Pros PecTs  Historically, the largest GDP contribution based on business fields for the 2015-Q3 2019 period is the manufacturing business amounting to 20.29%, followed by agriculture of 13.24% and trading of 13.12%.
The manufacturing, agricultural, and trading businesses are expected to continue to be the prospective industries in 2020.
Manufacturing grew 4.22% in the 2015-Q3 2019 period.
In  2020, manufacturing is expected to grow by 5.0-5.4%.
The prospective manufacturing sub-businesses include: textile, food and beverage industries, basic metals industry, and metal, electronic, optic industries.
Agriculture booked growth of 3.68% for the 2015-Q3 2019  period and is expected to grow by 3.7-3.9% in 2020 wherein the prospective sub-businesses include: Fisheries, Food and Crop Plantations.
Trading registered a 4.14% growth for the 2015-Q3 2019 period and is expected to grow 5.3-5.7% in 2020.
Trading sub-businesses that remains to be prospective in 2020 are the vehicle and non-vehicle trading industries.
The highest GDP growth based on business fields for the  2015-Q3 2019 period is the information and communication business sector amounting to 8.89% and is expected to grow by 7.1%-7.5% in 2020.
BaNkING INDusTry overv Iew Bank Indonesia projects credit growth (10%-12%) and third party growth (8%-10%) will be higher than in 2019.
Meanwhile, media reports indicated that Third Party Funds (TPF) as of November 2019 grew 6.4% and credit growth amounted to 7%.
Nevertheless, with low benchmark rates and high foreign investment appetite in debt instruments, banks may be forced to compete with the bond markets to obtain TPF .
Foreign funds will be attracted to Indonesia due to: stable economic growth (5%), low inflation and political stability that is relatively maintained.
As stated above, the government will experience a fiscal  deficit in 2020 and will issue bonds to address this deficit.
The government may potentially issue more bonds in 2020 compared to 2019 with an attractive (higher) coupon.
If this occurs, the banking sector’s liquidity may likely be limited in 2020 whereby the potential for growth will be at a single digit level.
BNI’s Pos ITIoN IN The Ba NkING  INDusTr y BNI is able to maintain its position in the banking industry by remaining the fourth largest bank, this is in line with the achievement of BNI CAGR during 2015-2019 both in terms of Assets, Lending, and DPK which is the highest compared to 3 other book IV banks.

The decrease is mainly brought about by the increase in Receivables pertaining to ATM and Credit Card transactions to Rp3.2 trillion from Rp2.3 trillion in 2018.
Fixed assets BNI booked net fixed assets valued at Rp26.6 trillion in 2019 from Rp26.1 trillion in the previous year, whereby none of BNI’s entire fixed assets are placed as collateral.
This increase is caused by the recording of the Menara Pejompongan building asset amounting to Rp748 billion in 2019.
Moreover, the management believes that there is no decrease in the value of BNI’s fixed assets within the current year since management believes that the fixed asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the estimated value that can be recovered.
Fixed asset’s (net) contribution to BNI’s total assets in 2019 and 2018 are 3.1% and 3.2% respectively.

This is attributed to the improvements in retained earnings in line with optimization of productive assets that year.
This achievement is substantially higher than the provisions set by Bank Indonesia through POJK No. 11/POJK.03/2016 on Minimum Capital Requirement for Commercial Banks that was amended through POJK No. 34/POJK.03/2016 namely a minimum of 9% of Calculated Risk Weighted Assets (ATMR) for banks with a risk profile rating of 2.

Profitability ratios roa In line with the decline in the ROA ratio in the industry level that was brought about by the decline in benchmark rates, BNI’s Return on Assets (ROA) ratio was lower to 2.42% in 2019.
This achievement is lower compared to the previous year’s ROA of 2.8% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2017 respectively.
roe In line with the ROA ratio, BNI also booked a lower ROE ratio amidst the capital increase.
Lower income margins and higher operating expenses challenges affected BNI’s profitability ratio.
Return on Equity (ROE) declined to 14.0% in 2019 from 16.1% (2018) and 15.6% (2017).
NIm BNI’s Net Interest Margin (NIM) declined from 5.3% in 2018 to 4.9% the following year.

liquidity ratios loan to Deposit ratio ( lDr)  BNI reported higher loan to deposit ratio (LDR) in 2019 of 91.5% from 88.8% the previous year.
This increase was mainly due to the much lower growth in TPF compared to the growth in loans in 2019.
This is driven by the challenges in liquidity conditions in the Indonesian financial market amidst the global economic uncertainty.
makroprudensial Intermediation ratio ( rIm) BNI’s Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio was reported to have increased to 86.6% compared to 84.6% the previous year.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Every increase in the derivative contract’s fair value is booked as asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair value is negative.
Derivative receivables and payables are classified as financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.
Gains or losses resulting from fair value changes are recognized in the consolidated profit and loss statement.
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined based  on discounted cash flows and pricing models or quoted prices from brokers of other instruments with similar characteristics.
Foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency swaps and cross currency swap as well as interest rate swaps are for funding and trading purposes.
Moreover, in conducting its business, BNI carries out  derivative financial instrument transactions such as foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency swap, interest rate swap and spot transactions for financing, trading and hedging purposes.
Total commitment liabilities in 2019 declined 26.4% compared with 2018 that was largely brought about by the 42.3% decline in sales of foreign currency futures unresolved.
Contingent receivables in 2019 increased 8.2% compared to 2018 largely due to the 18.9% increase in Interest Receivable on Non-Performing Assets.
However, contingent liabilities position declined 6.8% compared to 2018 and was caused by the decline in Bank Guarantees issued.
Overall, the fluctuating movements in commitments and contingencies corresponds with loan growth, as borrowers are increasingly using BNI’s numerous products and services that have competitive features.
Derivatives and hedging Facilities   BNI conducts derivative transactions both for the Bank as well as its customer’s interest.
As of December 31, 2019, BNI carried out USD-IDR Cross Currency Swap (CCS) transactions booking total asset value of USD 29 million.
Apart from the CCS transaction, BNI also carried out Interest Rate Swap (IRS) transactions with total asset value as of December 31, 2019 of USD 238 million.
The CCS and IRS transactions was carried out by taking into account the conditions of the market and its portfolio, in anticipation of currency as well as interest rate movements that could potentially harm the bank.

loans Basic lending rate  Based on the Financial Services Authority Regulation (POJK) No. 6/POJK.03/2015 on Bank Transparency and Report Publication that has been amended with POJK No. 32/POJK.03/2016 and Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 7/6/PBI/2005 on Bank Product Information Transparency and Use of Customer Personal Data (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia of 2005 Number 16, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Number 4475), Banks that conduct businesses conventionally in Indonesia are required to report and publish Prime Lending Rate (PLR) in Rupiah.
Implementing this PLR seeks to provide clarity to the  customer and enhance the customers to determine the benefit, costs and credit risks that is offered by the Company.
Moreover, PLR is meant to enhance good governance and promote healthy competition within the banking industry by, among others, instilling enhanced market discipline.
Moreover, PLR is used as an indicator of the loan interest rate to be applied to customers applying for loans from the Company.
As a result, BNI constantly updates the PLR in accordance with benchmark rate movements determined by Bank Indonesia.
PLR is generally calculated based on 3 (three) components, namely Cost of Funds for Loans (HPDK) arising from customer fund raising activities, operating expenses incurred for fund raising and loan disbursement activities as well as profit margin component that is determined by the Company in its lending activities.
The PLR calculation has not taken into account the risk premium component of the borrower, whose amount is determined on the basis of the evaluation of the borrower’s risks.
Therefore, the loan interest rate charged to the borrower is not necessarily the same as the PLR.
BNI is required to report the PLR calculation to Bank  Indonesia on a monthly basis and periodically widely publish in the media.
The PLR calculation applies to corporate loans, retail loans, micro loans, and consumer loans (Housing Loan and non-housing loan).
However, Bank Indonesia submits the classification for corporate loan, retail loan and consumer loan (Housing Loan and non-housing loan) based on the internal criteria used by the bank.

In 2016, OJK issued Letter  No.
S-18/D.03/2016 on Maximum Interest Rates whereby OJK submitted a directive to gradually reduce borrowing rates to single digit at the end of 2016.
In regards to this, BNI is committed to reduce its borrowing rates, which is reflected in the PLR comparison in 2016 and 2015 as follows:  Prime lending rate per year Based on Business segments credit corporationretail credit micro creditconsumer credit kPr  Non kPr Prime Lending Rate  9.95 9.95 - 10.25 12.25 Bank health level   The Bank’s Health Level (BHL) is the result of the Bank’s risk and performance assessment.
The Bank Health Level Assessment is carried out using the Risk-based Bank Rating approach both individually as well as on a consolidated basis.
The Bank’s health level is a means to identify at an early stage the bank’s problems, determine the future business strategy, formulate and implement corrective action over a bank’s weakness/problem, provide the basis for the process of linking capital with risk, as a basis for decision-making as well as to enhance competitiveness.
Meanwhile, the Bank’s Health Level serves as a means for determining the strategy and focus for supervision on the Bank for the supervisory authorities.
The Bank’s health level rating is based on 4 (four) factors as  follows:1.
risk Profile  The risk profile assessment is carried out by evaluating the Inherent Risk (risks that is attached to the Bank’s activities) and the Risk Management Application Quality (RMAQ) towards 8 risk types. 2.
Good corporate Governance  Good Corporate Governance assessment evaluates the Bank’s management quality over the application of Good Corporate Governance principles. 3.
earnings  Assessment over the Earnings factor covers profitability performance evaluation, profitability sources, profitability’s sustainability , and profitability management.
Financial review 4.
capital  Assessment over the Capital factors covers an evaluation over Capital and Capital Adequacy.
In the evaluating Capital Adequacy , BNI links its capital  adequacy with its risk profile.
The Bank’s Health Level Rating is reported to the regulator (OJK) every 6 months in June and December.
The results of BNI’s BHL rating for the December 31, 2019 period falls within the “Healthy” level that implies the following: a.
The Bank’s condition was generally healthy , thereby  deemed able to withstand significant negative effects from changes in business conditions and other external factors.
The rating assessment factors (Risk Profile, GCG, Profitability, and Capital) are generally good whereby if weaknesses are apparent, then these weaknesses are generally deemed insignificant.
As one of the factors to evaluate BHL, BNI’ s risk profile in  the December 31, 2019 period falls within rank 2 (low to moderate).
As a consequence of BNI’s risk profile that falls within the low to moderate ranking and in line with the calculation using the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the minimum CAR that corresponds with its risk profile is 9.95%.
If coupled with the buffer capital, namely the Conservation Buffer of 2.50%, Countercyclical Buffer of 0% and Capital Surcharge of 1.50%, then the Minimum Capital Requirement Ratio (MCRR) limit is 13.95%.
BNI’s MCRR in 2019 amounts to 19.7%, which exceeds the specified minimum limit.

Impact of Interest changes on the Bank’s  Performance Bank Indonesia has determined to gradually reduce the benchmark rates by as much as 4 (four) times throughout 2019.
The first reduction in the BI 7-day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) was as much as 25 bps to 5.75% that was determined within the Bank Indonesia Board of Governors Meeting (RDG) held on July 17-18, 2019.
This policy was carried out in line with the low projected inflation rate and need to push forth the momentum for economic growth, amidst the uncertainty within the global financial market and controlled external stability.
At the Board of Governors meeting held on August 21-22,  2019, BI reduced the BI 7-day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) by as much as 25 bps to 5.50% and the Deposit Facility rate by as much as 25 bps to 5.25%.
Similar reductions took place at the BI Board of Governors Meeting held on September 18-19, 2019 again reduced the BI7DRR by as much as 25 bps to 5.25%.
The last benchmark rate reduction was carried out through the BI Board of Governors Meeting held on October 23-24, 2019 that determined to reduce the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) by 25 bps to 5.00%.
This is consistent with the projected low inflation rate that falls within the middle of its targeted range, continued attractiveness of investment returns derived from domestic financial assets thereby supporting external stability, as well as a pre-emptive step to accelerate the momentum for future economic growth as a result of the global economic slowdown.
This policy is backed by a monetary operations strategy that continues to be reinforced to maintain adequate liquidity and support transmission of a series of accommodative policies.
Macro prudential policies remains accommodative to promote bank lending and expand financing for the economy.
The payment system and financial market deepening policies also continue to be strengthened to support economic growth.
Bank Indonesia’s coordination with the Government and related authorities continues to be strengthened so as to maintain economic stability, drive domestic demand, and increase exports, tourism and foreign capital inflows, including Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
This subsequently impacts the condition of the national  banking system, which is experiencing significant pressure in the decline in net interest margins (NIM).
The drive to reduce lending rates to support Indonesia’s economic growth at a time when inflation appears to be more controlled has received the right momentum.
This resulted in a decrease in BNI’s NIM to 4.9% in 2019 compared to 5.3% (2018) and 5.5% (2017).
Fee Based Income Growth acceleration  Fee based income that was successfully managed by BNI in 2019 amounted to Rp11.4 trillion, or 18.0% higher compared to 2018 of Rp9.6 trillion.
This increase is dominated by 4 (four) banking activities that include Account Maintenance, Card Business, ATM and Trade Finance.
The increase in fee based income from Account Maintenance services grew 16.3% from Rp1.7 trillion in 2018 to Rp2.0 trillion in 2019.
Card Business registered growth of 10.6% from Rp1.4 trillion in 2018 to Rp1.6 trillion in 2019.
ATM grew 13.2% from Rp1.1 trillion in 2018 to Rp1.3 trillion in 2019.
In line with the increase in these three services, Trade Finance services also grew by 4.8% from Rp1.2 trillion in 2018 to Rp1.3 trillion in 2019.

This is reflected in BNI’s ability to meet all of its maturing obligations in a timely manner, both in terms of principal as well as interest payments.
The banking financial ratio used to measure BNI’s liquidity and solvency are as follows: ability to Pay short-Term Debt (Bank liquidity)  BNI’s ability to meet its short-term obligations is made by maintaining good liquidity.
In line with the increase in short-term liquidity resiliency, BNI maintains adequate liquidity by managing a number of indicators that include Primary Reserve, Secondary Reserve, and Liquidity Coverage Ratio in accordance with the regulator’s provisions.
LCR is a comparative ratio between High Quality Liquid  Assets (HQLA) and estimated total net cash outflows for the next 30 (thirty) days in a crisis scenario.
In December 2019, BNI’s LCR reached 181.6% (bank only) and 184.1% (consolidated), which is above regulatory provisions that set LCR compliance to at least 100%.
In the context of managing liquidity for a longer period (1  year), BNI maintains Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFSR) by increasing bank funding stability that is adjusted with asset composition and administrative accounts.
NSFR is a ratio that compares the amount of Available Stable Funding to the Required Stable Funding.
As of December 2019, BNI’s NSFR was 136.2% (bank only) and 141.1% (consolidated), which is above the regulatory limit of 100%.
ability To Pay long-Term Debt (Bank solvency)  BNI’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the capital to Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) ratio, which in 2019 increased 19.3% compared to the CAR in 2018 of 18.5%.
This implies that BNI’s capital structure has the capability to balance credit risk, market risk, and operational risk wherein these ratios are higher than the minimum capital adequacy ratios determined by the regulator.
Financial review loan collectibility BNI booked Non Performing Loan (NPL) that is slightly higher in 2019 of 2.3% from 1.9% in 2018.
Despite this increase, BNI’s NPL continues to be below the Banking Industry’s of 2.7%.
Disbursed loans restructuring   Restructuring is carried out on debtors who still have business prospects and selectively carried out in accordance with the debtor’s ability.

Key factors driving improvement in global economic growth is GDP growth in developing countries by 4.6% when GDP growth in advanced countries is still relatively stagnant at 1.7%.
In line with this IMF growth projection, the World Bank in  its Global Economic Prospects report published in January 2020 also predicted improvement in global economic growth in 2020 although it was limited to 2.5% compared to the previous year of 2.4%.
The improvement in world GDP growth was mainly driven by economic growth in countries included in the Emerging Market and Developing economies (EMDE) category of 4.1% compared to GDP growth in developed countries which only grew 1.4%.
In line with the hopes of improving the world economy,  the Government of Indonesia in the 2020 State Budget and Expenditure Plan (RAPBN) estimates economic growth of 5.3% in 2020 sustained by well and controlled inflation management reaching 3.1%.
Supported by the estimated improvement in economic conditions accompanied by easing monetary and fiscal policies undertaken by Bank Indonesia (BI), the Financial Services Authority estimates credit growth in 2020 of 13.0% (sindonews.
com, August 16, 2019).
In addition to macroeconomic considerations, another  factor influencing BNI’s survival is the industrial revolution 4.0.
The Industrial Revolution is expected to have a fundamental impact because it has the potential to change the way industry works from production to sales by utilizing information technology.
This Industrial Revolution will make it easier for MSMEs to access a wider market with more cost-effective, and open up opportunities for opening new businesses as well as the need for loan capital.
On the other hand, opening market access allows MSMEs to compete head-to-head with big players so that they need good monitoring and management to survive.
Financial review management assessment of Potentially significant  effects on Business continuity Responding to these challenges, BNI developed an end-to-end digital credit process to support faster processes supported by monitoring utilizing data analytics.
In addition, BNI continues to improve credit quality through the development of an early warning system and improvements to the overall process, and by continuing to refresh the credit employees.
Furthermore, BNI internally manages productive assets with  sustainable prudence amidst banking business expansion while responding to the challenges of the Cost to Income Ratio (CIR) and the ratio of Operating Expenses to Operating Income (BOPO) which is still relatively high.
BNI considers the importance of increasing the productivity and efficiency of the banking process to support business initiatives and bank strategies in providing maximum service to customers.
The steps taken by BNI are carried out by considering the  strength possessed by BNI which has the highest Credit growth compared to Competitor Banks; Highest Corporate Segment growth compared to Competitor Banks; high KUR growth; good cash management skills; high Payroll growth; the best remittance service provider; and utilization of API Management.
In addition, BNI also considers and utilizes business  opportunities in the banking industry going forward to ensure the continuity of the Bank’s business.
These opportunities include: sustainability of infrastructure policies; investment policies that are open as wide as possible; planned issuance of holding BUMN banks and financial services; simultaneous local elections 2020; and an upward trend in electronic money transactions over the growth of depositor funds.
Several other business opportunities are triggered by high millennial financial transactions, the implementation of Qanun, and the implementation of Sustainable Financing.

The Bank Business Plan Document is prepared as a reference in carrying out BNI’s operational activities in the short term in accordance with the Vision, Mission, and Direction of BNI listed in the Bank’s Long-Term Plan (Corporate Plan).
In addition, considering the increasing competition in the  banking industry, BNI has 5 (five) strategies to deal with the banking industry competition as follows:a.
Capturing the potential business flow of APBN & APBD funds through penetration of the market share of regionally managed hospitals, educational institutions in the regions especially those whose operations are sourced from the state budget and regional government budgets and programs related to social assistance and subsidies.
Besides striving for BNI to become an operational bank for the Regional Government/Regional Government so that it can facilitate transactions within the region or between regions to the center.
Through transactional solutions that focus on partnerships in ministries/Government Institutions, SOEs, Non Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) and Universities to increase regional income while increasing accountability in regional financial management.
Improving the business of Corporate and Area customers by optimizing the business of corporate customers through supply chain financing (SCF) facilities, as well as optimizing operational demand deposits.

Internal factors include BNI’s ability to mobilize and allocate its resources as well as to  maintain and develop its core capabilities.
These are important factors in anticipating and capturing  business opportunities amidst existing external conditions.
The external factors that influence the business prospects  of the Bank are political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and regulatory conditions.
In general, post-election political conditions are quite conducive for the business world and BNI is always ready to anticipate the dynamics.
Demographic mapping that shows sufficient potential of the younger generation to be developed, and the estimated absence of horizontal and vertical shocks that may significantly disrupt activities in the real sector, are positive factors in the current social condition.
Meanwhile, support from technological factor is reflected by the increased internet penetration and use of gadgets that cause changes in customer preferences to meet their needs, thus resulting in disruption of the business models in various industrial sectors.
Meanwhile, efforts to minimize environmental, social and governance risks must be carried out more transparently in line with the regulation for implementation of sustainable financing in the financial services industry and issuers, in terms of environmental and regulatory factors.
Regarding economic factor, the Government of Indonesia  has set a target for economic growth of 5.3% in 2020.
Estimation for a higher economic growth is supported by strengthening consumption and investment.
Household consumption is expected to grow, with maintained inflation, the effectiveness of social assistance programs, and job creation.
Government consumption will be supported by an increase in operational expenditure and investment expenditure (capital, infrastructure, and human resources).
Investment growth is supported by increased direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment through financial market deepening, improvement of the Ease of Doing Business, Investment Grade, and infrastructure development.
Exports will grow due to the strengthening of exports through product diversification, strengthening of export-oriented manufacturing industries, and increased tourism services.
Meanwhile, imports will increase in line with increased economic activity.
In line with optimism for improvement in Indonesia’s GDP growth in 2020, bank lending is expected to grow by 11.0% -13.0%.
The increase in loans provided by the banking sector is projected to be followed by growth in Third Party Funds (DPK) of 9.0% - 11.0% in the same year.

PERFORMANCE IN 2019 Selective Growth of Earning Assets Throughout 2019, the trade war between the United  States (US) and China became a central issue in the global economy.
The trade war caused a decline in the volume of world trade and consequently slowed the pace of world economic growth.
World economic growth is expected to decline from 3.6% in 2018 to only 3.0% in 2019.
On the other hand, the Indonesian economy shows resilience, although it has slowed slightly in line with the weakening global economy.
GDP growth in 2019 was recorded at 5.05% (yoy), although slowing slightly from the same period in the previous year at 5.17% (yoy).  3162019 Annual Report  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk 3172019 Annual Report  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Digitalization for Excellent Services Digitalization for Excellent Services Performance Highlights 2019 Company Profile Management Report Management Discussion & AnalysisAgainst this backdrop, BNI established a policy to continue  to strengthen business expansion in selected corporate markets and commercial segments in selected sectors to maintain the growth of productive assets.
BNI also optimizes supply chain and cross selling, as an important element in achieving quality credit growth through a deep assessment process on the parent account (Anchor Company).
Throughout 2019, BNI managed to record credit growth of  8.6% to Rp556.8 trillion, marking the stable acceleration of the banking intermediation function amid challenging economic conditions.
This achievement was supported by the Bank’s efforts to improve and manage credit risk to create higher quality growth.
In line with the established risk appetite, BNI ensures credit quality is maintained through synergy between business units.
As a result, BNI was able to maintain credit quality with the achievement of the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at the level of 2.3%.
Credit Risk Management Strategy Through various strategies and policies, the Bank was able to record credit growth of Rp556.8 trillion in 2019.
The credit growth was carried out by applying the principle of prudence consistently so that even the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) up 2.3%, it was offset by the increase in CKPN of Rp1.8 trillion which lead to relatively high yields.
BNI also implements a strategy of selective expansion in sectors that have low risk where BNI is a major player.
In addition, BNI also restructured and remedial for troubled debtors, who still have the potential for financial and operational improvements.
Absolute NPL (Bank only) recorded a decrease from Rp9.2 trillion in 2018 to Rp11.9 trillion in 2019.
Then, the gross NPL ratio was recorded at 2.3% in 2019 with the net NPL recorded 1.2% in 2019.
BNI continues to show commitment to continue to maintain the quality of loans provided amid aggressive expansion.

Therefore, throughout 2019, BNI carried out the HC strategy and management that was aligned with the Bank’s long-term strategy and business developments in the financial industry both now and in the future.
HC management in 2019 is focused on optimizing productivity through accelerating the development of capabilities to prepare BNI HC to be able to adapt to increasingly dynamic and competitive business challenges. 3182019 Annual Report  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk 3192019 Annual Report  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Digitalization for Excellent Services Digitalization for Excellent Services Corporate Social Responsibility Good Corporate Governance Risk Management Capital & PracticeROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL BNI believes that to realize the vision of becoming an excellent Financial Institution in Services and Performance, it takes  “Highly Engaged Employee” and “Highly Productive Employee”.
A number of factors that can promote employee engagement (engagement driver) are leadership, career paths, rewards and remuneration, organizational policies, employee learning and development, performance management, work environment, work-life balance, and work infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the factors that influence employee productivity are business processes, organization, technology, and execution culture.
Thus, to ensure that BNI employees are engaged and productive employees, Human Capital has the role to intervene through the preparation and implementation of Human Capital policies that are in line with BNI’s business strategy.

BNI uses the phrase “Together” as an emphasize that employees and itself are two interrelated and inseparable entities in realizing BNI’s vision.
Under the HC Architecture applied at BNI, there are organization and employees that are interrelated with one another.
The  organization has a set of objective to be achieved, along with the strategy laid to achieve these goals, as well as corporate culture serving as guidelines of behavior of the employees.
The employees are expected to be able to show performance that supports the achievement of organizational goals, competencies that are aligned with strategy, and employee behavior that is consistent with organizational culture.
To support the above, BNI’s HC is supported by career path system (talent & sucession), capability development system  (learning & development), as well as appreciation for the contributions made (reward and recognition).
As an organization with employees spread throughout Indonesia, it is imperative that the Bank has to be supported with Information, Communication & Technology as the main infrastructure, in order to reach all of its employees that spread throughout BNI operational area.
And the most important thing in implementing Human Capital policy is the active role of leaders throughout the organization to the smallest unit to be able to implement policies optimally.

OPTIMIZING PRODUCTIVITY AND  ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENT In 2019, the Human Capital Strategy is adjusted to suit  the main theme, namely “Optimizing Productivity and Accelerating Development”.
This theme was realized through a number of initiatives including by optimizing employee productivity through robust workforce planning and by accelerating human resources development with an integrated development plan mechanism.
Workforce Planning Strategy Workforce planning strategies include managing headcount, managing costs and managing capabilities that are aligned with BNI’s business processes.
In order to increase employee productivity as measured by Earning per Employee (EPE), one of BNI’s strategies is by maintaining total number of employee.
In 2019, total number of employee allocated by the Company is lower than that of 2018.
Apart from the number of employees, in 2019 the composition of employees in business origination positions is also targeted to be increased in order to support the achievement of BNI’s business targets.
A number of initiatives were undertaken to support the achievement of this target, among others through evaluating work processes, employee deployment towards business origination positions and employee recruitment focused on business origination positions.
This initiative is certainly aligned with the employee capability development strategy before occupying a new position so that it is able to contribute optimally in supporting the achievement of BNI’s business targets.
The realization of total number of employees in 2019 was  27,211, lower than the number of employees in the previous year.
This attainment has also proven to be effective in supporting the achievement of BNI’s business targets as measured by the Earning per Employee indicator of Rp. 537 million/employee, an increase from the previous year.
The realization of the composition of employees in the business origination position reached 55%, an increase compared to 2018 by 49% and 2017 by 43%.
To ensure the availability of new talent in line with BNI’s business needs, in 2019 BNI will continue to open a number of recruitment channels in accordance with the position required.
The employee recruitment process carried out aims to ensure that employee regeneration can take place on an ongoing basis.
The Officer Development Program or ODP is a prospective  officer development program that aims to recruit new graduates from universities to pursue careers at BNI.
Employees recruited through this path will then undergo the development process as trainee before eventually occupying the destination position.
In 2019, the number of employees recruited through the ODP was 788 employees.
In addition to Officer-level positions, BNI also continues to  open recruitment for assistant levels, mostly aimed at filling assistant-level positions at Branch Offices and Centers.
The goal position of this channel recruitment is mostly focused on business origination positions such as sales, credit staff, and service-related positions with a total of 935 employees.
BINA BNI is an apprenticeship program as a manifestation  of BNI’s social care and responsibility.
The program, which has been running since 2017, aims to provide fresh graduates with the knowledge, skills and abilities to be able to compete in the workforce.
Participants receive formal training before undergoing practice in their respective placement positions.
Thus, participants have the opportunity to practice the knowledge gained during formal training.
In their daily lives, trainees are also accompanied and directed by mentors to be given ongoing guidance.
In 2019, the number of Bina BNI apprentices was 4329 participants.
Meanwhile, employee turnover in 2019 was 4.57% or  decreased from 2018 of 4.76%.
This decrease in turnover is the impact of the ongoing efforts of Human Capital management until 2019.
ACCELERATING  TALENT  DEVELOPMENT Talent Development is part of talent management mechanism applied at BNI which consists of Talent Acquisition, Talent Classification, Talent Development, Talent Mobility and Talent Retention.
The purpose of Talent Development is to develop talent so that it has the capability to support the realization of BNI’s vision, both now and in the future.

In order to deal with these conditions, BNI established programs that aim to provide opportunities for employees to accelerate and improve the capabilities of hard skills and soft skills, especially in the field of leadership.
Leader Succession   By focusing on leadership capabilities, BNI carries the theme of Leaders Create New Leaders, which can be translated into Building Immediate Successors and Preparing Future Leaders.
It is intended to prepare successors, both in the short and long term.
This successor development method uses the concept of 70:20:10, which is 70% Experiential Learning, where participants are actively involved in activities in related units, 20% Social Learning, namely through discussion and sharing from mentors or peers, and 10% Formal Learning, namely by studying material both from books and formal training.
The talent development system is formed by taking into  account the results of the assessment, performance appraisal, and talent mobility plan.
Mentoring, cross mentoring, and coaching programs are methods of developing fellow employees that aim to improve the ability of hard skills and soft skills, especially the leadership abilities of each employee.
Career Acceleration: Skip & Speed Track   This program is intended to accelerate employee careers, to occupy higher managerial positions, with candidates sourced from internal BNI and carried out through a series of development programs so that candidates are expected to master more competence from positions to be occupied.
Career acceleration program is divided into 2 (two), namely Skip Track which is the process of accelerating career mobility of employees to the level and grade of the destination position by jumping over 1 (one) position/level, and Speed Track is the process of accelerating employee mobility towards the level and grade of the destination position, faster than normal mobility.
