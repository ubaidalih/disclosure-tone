96 Financial and Operational Highlights Management Report Company Profile Annual Report 2019    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk Economy and Industrial Overview Overview of the National Economy Amidst of global economic turmoil, Indonesia’s  strong economic fundamental allowed the country to have a good economic growth.
Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency, Indonesia's economic growth in 2019 grew by 5.02%.
Although lower than the previous year’s economic growth of 5.17%, such economic growth was one of the highest achievements among the G20 member countries.
Sustained economic growth was supported by strong household consumption aligned with maintained inflation at a low level of 2.72%, a decrease compared to 2018, which was 3.13%.
A stable inflation rate was driven by controlled price of staple foods aligned with maintained domestic productivity and distribution of staple foods in the country.
Controlled inflation was also supported by the  government's strong commitment to maintain the inflation of the government-regulated price of goods, such as fuel and energy.
Proactive roles of the Government and Bank Indonesia (BI) in coordinating with the Local Governments to maintain inflation has also been improved.
Overview of the Global Economy The global economy dynamics in 2019 is greatly affected by the increasing tension of trade relations between the United States (US) and China.
The economic growth realization throughout 2019 showed a downward trending, both from developed and developing countries.
US economic growth realization in 2019 was 2.3%,  lower than the previous year's growth of 2.9%.
Likewise, China was also decreased from 6.6% in 2018 to only 6.1% in 2019.
It is also the lowest economic growth for China for the last 29 years.
Commodity prices were pressured aligned with  decreased demands.
in 2019, average daily oil price for Brent decreased to USD64.2 per barrel, from USD71.1 per barrel.
Likewise, coal and palm oil as the main commodities in Indonesia.
Average daily price for coal and palm oil declined to respectively USD524.7 and USD77.0 per metric ton, from previously USD559.5 and USD107.2 per metric ton in 2018.
This decline is impacting the economy of commodity-producer countries such as Indonesia.
Responding to the global economic slowdown, central banks around the world are doing fiscal stimulus and monetary easing policy, including lowering their interest rates.
Throughout 2019, the Federal Reserve (US Central Bank) was recorded of cutting their interest rate twice for the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), from 2.50% to 1.75%.
in addition to lower interest rate, the Fed also implemented an accommodative policy through the purchase of securities to cope with tightened liquidity in the US financial system.
The policies adopted by the Fed are influencing the  capital flows to emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, as well as Indonesia.
Based on data from the Institute for International Finance (IIF), total foreign capital flows into emerging markets throughout 2019, both in the stock market and bond market, reached USD78 billion, after the previous year’s flow of foreign capitals of only USD9, 9 billion.
This also gives space for some central banks in developing countries to reduce their interest rates.
Such policy of interest rates reduction is expected to bring a positive impact on the global economic growth in 2020. 97 Management Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Financial Statements Good Corporate Governance Corporate Social Responsibility Annual Report 2019    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkIndonesian economic stability was also reflected in  Rupiah movement, which was appreciated against the US Dollar with lower volatility compared to 2018 performance.

Although  deficit remains, but the trade balance deficit in 2019, which was amounted to USD3.2 billion or Rp43.8 trillion, is far smaller compared to the previous year’s USD8.7 billion or Rp119.2 trillion.
Indonesia's success in maintaining economic  growth could not be separated from policies issued by the government and the Bank Indonesia (BI).
in 2019, Bank Indonesia has recorded four times, lowered the BI reference rate for 7 Days Reverse Repo Rate, each by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.0%.
This policy is expected to bring loan rates to a lower level, so that business players can intensify their investments or business expansion to boost production.
Additionally, declined loan interest rates is expected to provide stimulus to the public to maintain their consumption.
In addition to lower interest rates, macroprudential  policies were also taken to encourage bank credit growth by loosening the provisions for the LTV/FTV (Loan to Value/Financing to Value) ratio for an average of 5-10% for home and vehicle ownership, loosening the provisions for Ratio Macroprudential Intermediation (RIM) to 84-94% from previously 80-92%, as well as expanding banking funding including prudent foreign loans of more than 1 (one) year.
Overview of the National Cement Industry Challenge in the Indonesian cement industry continues.
Demand for cement in 2019, based on data from the Indonesian Cement Association (ASI), only grew under 1%.
The national cement sales in 2019 reached 76.1  million tons.
of that number, 69.8 million tons were from domestic sales and the rest of the sales, or as much as 6.3 million tons, were from the export market.
Based on the data from ASI, cement sales in  domestic market only grew 0.34% in 2019.
in fact, domestic cement sales have already dropped by 2% during the first half of 2019.
Growth of cement demand decreased compared to the previous year due to the national election agendas.
Many infrastructure projects have been completed in 2018, while the new project initiative were delayed to post-formation of the new ministerial cabinet.
Additionally, the property industry did not show any improvement that can boost the growth of domestic cement demand.
Meanwhile, from supply chain perspective, domestic capacity remained excessive by 37 million tons.
With declined growth of the national cement demand and overcapacity of cement supplies, the national cement plant utilization only reached 67.4% in 2019.

Moreover, after a corporate action was conducted on early 2019, in which the Company acquired PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk, Semen Indonesia is currently the largest player in the cement industry in Southeast Asia.
Today, the Company owns production facilities in  many Indonesian regions as well as Vietnam, with total installed production capacity of 53 million tons per year.
Not just the largest in terms of production capacity, the Company is also the biggest player with a market share of 53.4% in Indonesia.
This is made possible by the Company’s five brands dominating each region, including Semen Gresik, Semen Padang, Semen Tonasa, Semen Andalas and Dynamix.
in addition to strong brands, the Company also owns distribution facilities in many regions in Indonesia, which becomes one of the Company’s advantages that enable us to maintain our domination in the national cement market, as distribution of production across the nation, especially for bulk cements, is one of the biggest challenges of cement producers in Indonesia due to the country’s vast archipelago region.

Growth in domestic demand was below 1%, while the national cement industry remains oversupplied aligned with continuous development for cement capacity building, particularly from the new players.
Strategic Marketing Initiatives Amidst a challenging market condition, the Company has taken a number of strategic initiatives, especially in marketing areas, such as: Rebranding Dynamix In 2019, the Company took a bold step to rebrand the Holcim brand as Dynamix.
Dynamix rebranding is part of the transformation process carried out by the Company after the acquisition of PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk.
The rebranding reflects the new spirit of the Company, 'Dare to Change to be Better', to win the competition amidst an increasingly competitive national market.
As part of the transformation process of the Company,  Dynamix is expected to provide added values to meet the customers’ needs for innovation-oriented building materials for the future.
Premium Brand Strategy  The cement industry has an interesting characteristic.
Cement brand is usually a heritaged brand which has a fairly strong presence in the area where the plant is located.
Based on this fact, in 2019 the Company created an integrated marketing function by implementing a premium brand strategy.
The Company currently has five different cement  brands.
Each brand has different characteristics and strengths as well.
in 2019, the Company enhanced the cement brands with strong presence as premium brands in their respective region, instead of introducing encourage more brands in the region.
The presence of other brands is only necessary when there is a "disruption" from competitors that threatens the presence of our premium brand.
By implementing this strategy, there are at least  two benefits for the Company: a better profit level and a more cost-efficient marketing and distribution process.
Provides Solutions, Not Just Products Semen Indonesia Group has a very diversed line of products.
in 2019, these advantages were optimized by carrying out an integrated marketing program.
The Company not only focus in marketing the products, but also providing solutions that consist of several products and services.
By implementing this strategy, the Company creates  a very clear differentiation from our competitors.
Additionally, this strategy is also very effective to open new markets amidst oversupplied cement market.
Strengthen the Export Market Furthermore, the Company is strengthening its position as the largest cement industry player in Southeast Asia and continues to boost overseas markets.
This approach is taken to ensure and maintain the Company’s high sales volume, thus the utilization of production facilities could be maintained in a bid to implement the capacity management strategy.
Although domestic market remains as the Company’s  main market, the Company is also expanding our export markets as their potentials are not to be ignored, as long as the transport cost is affordable.
Export market development is carried out by  PT Semen Indonesia International (SII), whose responsible to maintain the Company’s cement sales volume stability.
Through SII, the Company will also be able to optimize export market potentials for our cement and clinker products when domestic demand fall, and vice versa, to meet domestic demands when it rises.
Customer Focus The Company changed its sales paradigm from production focus to customer focus.
With this approach, the Company established direct interaction with our customers, both retail and corporate.
For retail customers, the Company enhanced   distributors’ active role in production distribution.
As for corporate customers, the Company has the Corporate Marketing Unit focusing in bulk and bag cement demands, either the huge demand from  101 Management Discussion and Analysis Consolidated Financial Statements Good Corporate Governance Corporate Social Responsibility Annual Report 2019    PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbkcompanies or from real estates, contractors, industry  and many others, including implementing the synergy concept among SOEs to market our products.
The Corporate Marketing Unit will continue its  competence development in the future, so that it will be able to market related products of building materials through product and service solutions, as well as collaborate and synergize with the Company’s subsidiaries.
Role Optimization of Distributors Distributors have a very important role in the marketing chain of cement products.
Hence, the Company seeks to continue to optimize the role of distributors, not just as functions act as traders.
Distributors are also required develop store networks while continue to improve engagement with their existing store network.
Amidst oversupplied market condition and rampant  cement products with cheaper price, distributors are expected to play a bigger role in protecting the Company’s product positioning from competitors.
Marketing Communications In 2019, the Company carried out a huge change in terms of marketing communications.
By implementing an integrated marketing strategy, the Company did not have to force ourselves to run a national marketing communications.
