100100 2022 Annual Report   PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk BUSINESS AND  OPERATIONS REVIEW In FY22, PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk (AEI) achieved  historical high performance supported by higher volume  and higher average selling price (ASP) compared to FY21.
AEI delivered on its guidance, and production volume  reached 62.88 million tonnes (Mt), a 19% increase year- on-year (y-o-y) from 52.70 Mt in FY21.
This achievement  surpassed AEI’s FY22 production guidance of 58-60 Mt.
Sales volume also increased by 19% y-o-y to 61.34 Mt in  FY22 from 51.58 Mt in FY21.
We booked operational EBITDA of $5.0 billion in FY22, 139%  increase y-o-y from $2.1 billion in FY21.
Underinvestment in  new capacity and geopolitical factors affected the ability of  supply side to catch up with the strong demand, pushing  coal prices to reach historical highs in 2022.
This condition  provided a boon to our ASP, which increased by 74% y-o-y.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis  Diskusi dan Analisis Manajemen 101101 Laporan T ahunan 2022  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk  A Snapshot of  Adaro Energy  Indonesia Sekilas Adaro  Energy  Indonesia Management  Report  Laporan  Manajemen Our  Team Tim  Kami Sustainable  Development Pembangunan  yang  Berkelanjutan Partners in  the Capital  Market Mitra Pasar  ModalOur  Businesses Our  BusinessesOperations and marketing review Our FY22 production of 62.88 Mt was 19% higher compared  to 52.70 Mt in FY21, and higher than FY22 production  target of 58-60 Mt.
Sales volume in FY22 of 61.34 Mt was  also 19% higher from FY21 achievement of 51.58 Mt.
Our main coal producing asset is PT Adaro Indonesia (AI),  which represented 78% of AEI’s total coal production.
AI, Balangan and MIP produce  medium calorific value thermal coal with low pollutant  content widely used by coal-fired power plants.
ADMR  produces hard coking coal product used as raw material  in the production of steel.
Coal production from Balangan  increased 36% y-o-y to 7.11 Mt from 5.24 Mt, coal production  from MIP increased 65% y-o-y to 3.28 Mt from 1.99 Mt, and  metallurgical coal production from ADMR increased 46%  y-o-y to 3.37 Mt from 2.30 Mt.
We recorded overburden removal volume of 235.68 million  bank cubic meter (Mbcm) in FY22, 8% higher from 218.90  Mbcm in FY21.
Although we recorded higher overburden  removal volume, we were not able to deliver on our strip  ratio target of 4.1x and finished the year with a strip  ratio of 3.75x, 10% lower from 4.15x in FY21.
Despite lower  y-o-y, we are still in the range of our average life of mine  strip ratio.
Inclement weather, and limited availability  of heavy equipment and manpower were some of the  factors that affected overburden removal achievement.
The higher overburden removal volume, fuel price, and  longer distance increased our per tonne coal cash cost  (excluding royalty) by 17% y-o-y.
In FY2022 AEI sold its coal to more than 50 customers in  sixteen countries including Indonesia, which constituted  25% of our sales.
The remaining sales in the year were  dominated by Asian countries from Southeast Asia to  Northeast Asia.
Our marketing efforts are supported by differentiated  market positioning due to the ultra-low pollutants  content of our coal and our reputation as a reliable and  dependable supplier.
We have a solid customer base –  consisting of mostly blue-chip, sovereign-backed power  companies with long-term volume contracts.
We continue  to maintain customer satisfaction by making various  efforts to ensure quality and reliability through good  coordination along Adaro’s vertically integrated coal  supply chain.
To mark  this moment, we streamlined our business to now consist  of three business pillars: Adaro Energy, Adaro Minerals,  and Adaro Green.
Adaro Energy pillar comprises our main business – the  pit-to-power vertically integrated energy supply chain.
PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (IDX: ADMR) is the  holding company for Adaro Minerals pillar, and this pillar  comprises our metallurgical coal operations, also minerals  and minerals processing for EV battery ecosystem and  the green economy.
Adaro Green pillar comprises our  green and renewable energy to support the downstream  processing, and diversification of energy mix in Indonesia.
The volatile industry landscape on the back of economic  recovery, supply-side underinvestment, and geopolitical  tension resulted in never-before-seen level of coal prices  which created a boon for our profitability in FY22.
This  solid profitability will allow us to accelerate our business  transformation projects under Adaro Minerals and Adaro  Green pillars.
Profitabilitas yang solid ini akan  mendorong percepatan proyek transformasi bisnis AEI  di bawah pilar Adaro Minerals dan Adaro Green.  103103 Laporan T ahunan 2022  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk  A Snapshot of  Adaro Energy  Indonesia Sekilas Adaro  Energy  Indonesia Management  Report  Laporan  Manajemen Our  Team Tim  Kami Sustainable  Development Pembangunan  yang  Berkelanjutan Partners in  the Capital  Market Mitra Pasar  ModalOur  Businesses Our  BusinessesWe believe that the fundamental for our business is  solid, supported by developing economies especially in  the Southeast Asia and South Asia region.
The growing  requirement for electricity and steel to support increased  urbanization, infrastructure building, and economic  growth in those regions will become the underlying factor.
Indonesian domestic market is also a key driver in coal  demand growth.
According to PLN’s RUPTL 2021 – 2030,  the portion of coal in the fuel mix would remain around  60% until 2030 with planned new installed capacity during  the period of 14 GW.
The advent of green economy is expected to support the  demand for green minerals product and we are taking  part in this movement through our subsidiary, ADMR.
ADMR currently engages in metallurgical coal mining  activities through its subsidiaries, but we envision ADMR  to be the centre for management and development  of our business endeavors related to minerals.
One of  ADMR’s subsidiaries is developing an aluminum smelter   in the industrial estate developed and managed by PT  Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia (KIPI) in North  Kalimantan, Indonesia’s first green industrial facility.
Demand fundamentals for metallurgical coal remains  solid in the long-term, underpinned by infrastructure  growth and the advent of green economy which requires  vast amount of steel.
Steel production with blast furnace  will continue to dominate which would sustain demand  for coking coal in the long run.
India would lead demand  growth in the future, as it is expected to continue  importing metallurgical coal to fulfil its need for steel  production and consumption.
In addition, Indonesia  expects to see an increase in demand for metallurgical  coal within the next five years on the back of expected  coke capacity growth.
On the supply side, Indonesian metallurgical coal exports  are expected to rise with expansions of existing mines and  greenfield projects coming online in the next few years.
Indonesian coal has a uniqueness in its quality that has  gained tractions in the seaborne market.
Low geopolitical  risk is another competitive advantage of Indonesian coal.
The Adaro Green pillar has been actively participating in  bids for various renewable energy projects.
Under this  pillar, we have several projects in the pipeline from wind  power plant to Indonesia’s largest hydro power plant.
Melalui pilar ini, kami  memiliki beberapa proyek dalam pengembangan mulai  dari pembangkit listrik tenaga angin hingga pembangkit  listrik tenaga air terbesar di Indonesia. 104104 2022 Annual Report   PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk The development of various processing and  downstreaming projects in Indonesia still require coal  in the transition, which will further support coal demand  in the long term and create underlying demand for our  businesses along the vertically integrated supply chain.
We will also develop other businesses as part of our green  initiatives such as water treatment and forestry for carbon  capture and ecosystem restoration.
Company guidance and prospect in 2023 We expect the continuing global economic recovery to  support the positive market outlook for our products.
We are going to leverage on the positive industry  outlook and expect sales volume to grow in 2023 to  62 Mt – 64 Mt, 1% - 4% higher compared to FY22 sales  volume, consisting of 58 Mt to 60 Mt of thermal coal,  and 3.8 Mt to 4.3 Mt of metallurgical coal from ADMR.
ADMR continues to grow its volume on the back of  solid demand from customers in line with its 6 Mtpa  medium term volume target.
Volume from Balangan  Coal Companies and PT Mustika Indah Permai are  also expected to increase.
This figure does not include  Kestrel’s mine FY23 target of 6 Mt.
We estimate capital expenditure in FY23 to be in the range  of $400 million – $600 million.
This capex is allocated for  routine capex and expansion of, primarily, our mining,  services, and logistics businesses.
This capex does not  include capex for our business transformation projects  in Kaltara.
We have several projects coming up in this  industrial park including aluminium smelter and hydro  power plant.
We will make further announcement on our  equity portion in these projects later.
Kami akan mengumumkan porsi  ekuitas dalam proyek-proyek ini nanti. 105105 Laporan T ahunan 2022  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk  A Snapshot of  Adaro Energy  Indonesia Sekilas Adaro  Energy  Indonesia Management  Report  Laporan  Manajemen Our  Team Tim  Kami Sustainable  Development Pembangunan  yang  Berkelanjutan Partners in  the Capital  Market Mitra Pasar  ModalOur  Businesses Our  BusinessesImpact of change in regulation IUPK for the Continuation of Contract/Agreement  Operation Our subsidiary PT Adaro Indonesia (AI) was governed by the  provisions of a Coal Cooperation Agreement (CCA).
In July  2021, AI submitted the application for the continuation of AI’s  mining operation under a Special Mining Business Permit for  the Continuation of Contract/Agreement Operation (IUPK for  the Continuation of Contract/Agreement Operation) to the  Government.
On September 13, 2022, AI received an IUPK for  the Continuation of Contract/Agreement Operation issued  by the Minister of Investment/Chairman of the Investment  Coordinating Board of the Republic of Indonesia on behalf  of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.
The IUPK for the Continuation of Contract/Agreement  Operation has been granted for a period expiring on 1  October 2032, which can be extended in accordance with  the prevailing regulations.
After AI has status as an IUPK  for the Continuation of Contract/Agreement Operation  holder, the provisions on taxation and/or Non-Tax State  Revenue will be implemented in accordance with the  prevailing regulations as stipulated in Government  Regulation No. 15/2022 from 1 January 2023.
Some of the changes from CCA to IUPK for the  Continuation of Contract/Agreement Operation are  summarized below:    CCA  PKP2BIUPK 1 Royalty rate Tarif royalti13.5% 14% - 28% 2 Corporate income tax rate Tarif pajak penghasilan45% 22% 3 Profit sharing (from net income) Bagi hasil (dari laba bersih) • Central Government  Pemerintah pusat- 4% • Regional Government Pemerintah daerah- 6% Government Regulation No. 26/2022 On 15 August 2022, the Government issued Government  Regulation No. 26/2022, concerning Types and Tariffs for  Types of PNBP that apply to the MoEMR, which among  others regulates receipts from the use of natural mineral  and coal resources from holders of mining license (IUP).
The royalty going  forward will be based on whichever is higher between  HBA pricing and invoice price and could increase to  between 7% - 10.5% from 3% - 5%.
Ministerial Decree No.267.
B/2022 On 21 November 2022, MoEMR issued Ministerial Decree  No. 267.
B/2022 regarding Fulfilment of  Domestic Coal Needs (“Ministerial Decree 267.
B/2022), which revoked Ministerial Decree No.139.
B/2021 regarding Fulfilment of Domestic Coal  Needs and Ministerial Decree No.13.
B/2022  regarding the Guidelines for Imposing Administrative  Sanctions, Prohibition of Coal Exports, and Imposing  Fines and Compensation Funds to Fulfil Domestic Coal  Needs.
The Ministerial Decree No.267.
B/2022  determined the percentage of coal sales for domestic  market obligation (DMO) of 25% (twenty five percent)  of the initial planned annual coal production volume as  stated in the initial approval of Annual Work Plan and  Budget (Rencana Kerja dan Anggaran Biaya Tahunan  or “RKAB”) or the amendment to the RKAB approved by  the Government, whichever is higher.
Information on investment, expansion,  divestment, and others We now operate businesses comprising of coal mining  and non-coal mining businesses.
Despite the significance  of coal mining to our profitability, the contribution of non- coal mining continues to increase.
In FY22, revenue from  metallurgical coal accounted for 11% of our revenue.
We  expect the contribution of metallurgical coal to continue  increase along with the increase in sales volume from  ADMR.
In January of 2022 we listed ADMR in the Indonesia  Stock Exchange.
We envision ADMR to be the centre for  management and development of our business endeavors  related to minerals, and its IPO is one of the keys for us to  develop of our non-coal mining businesses and achieve  sustainable long-term growth for the company through  participation in green minerals and their downstream  processing.
In August 2022, we achieved commercial operation of  PLTU Batang, a 2x1,000 MW power plant in Central Java  under PT Bhimasena Power Indonesia (BPI).
Also in November 2022, Total Eren S.
and PT Adaro Power  was appointed as Winning Bidder for the development  of the 70 MW with 10 MW/10 MWh BESS Independent  Power Producer in South Kalimantan.
On 29 November 2022, PT Mentarang Tirta Energi (MTE)  together with PT Kayan Energi Internasional (KEI) acquired  PT Kayan Hydropower Nusantara from Sarawak Energy  Services Sdn.
Bhd and PT Kayan Investama Internasional  with shares ownership of 50% and 50%, respectively, to  develop Mentarang Hydroelectric Power Plant in North  Kalimantan.
Through Adaro Minerals and Adaro Green pillars, the  company is diversifying and growing its business in a  more sustainable manner.
This business model allows us to be more efficient  while at the same time creates business opportunities for  the entire business pillars and values for shareholders.
Our  business is still dominated by coal mining and trading  under the Adaro Energy pillar.
The strong coal prices in  FY22 created a tailwind for our ASP.
Hence revenue from  coal mining and trading segments accounted 98% of  ADRO’s FY22 revenue.
We expect the revenue contribution from  metallurgical coal to increase along with ADMR’s volume  growth and sustained strong metallurgical coal price.
Our businesses are divided into three business pillars,  namely Adaro Energy, Adaro Minerals, and Adaro Green.
Having these business pillars strengthen the foundation  of our business and provide us with a more resilient and  competitive position for the longer term and enable us  to take part in various opportunities in green economy.

The significant increase  in revenue was driven by higher sales volume and higher  ASP on a year-on-year basis.
The tailwind of strong coal  prices in FY22 boosted ADRO’s ASP by 74% higher than  its ASP in FY21.
Inclement weather, supply constraints and geopolitical  events have maintained prices near historically high levels  and thereby supporting the year-on-year ASP increase  for the company.
Increasing metallurgical coal volume from our subsidiary,  PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (IDX: ADMR), and the  strong metallurgical coal price, have supported the portion  of revenue from metallurgical coal.
In FY22, revenue from  ADMR accounted for approximately 11% of AEI’s revenue.
Revenue portion from metallurgical coal is expected to  continue increase as ADMR’s volume grows to 6 Mtpa in  the medium term.
Cost of revenue Cost of revenue in FY22 increased 55% to $3.4 billion from  $2.2 billion in the year ago period, mainly due to higher  royalty expense driven by higher sales volume and higher  ASP.
Mining cost increased 28% to $1.1 billion from $871  million a year ago due to higher overburden removal and  production volume.
Coal cash cost per tonne (excluding  royalty) increased by 17% y-o-y due to higher volume and  higher fuel cost.
We continued to maintain efficiency  along our vertically integrated supply chain.
Total fuel consumption in FY22 increased 1% y-o-y despite  the 19% increase in production volume, as a result of our  energy efficiency initiatives.
Meanwhile, fuel price per  liter increased by 78% y-o-y.
Royalties to government Royalties expense to the government in FY22 increased  183% to $1.2 billion from $435 million in FY21 driven by  higher revenue.

Operational EBITDA, core earnings, and net  profit ADRO generated strong operational EBITDA of $5.0 billion  in FY22, 139% higher than $2.1 billion in FY21 due to higher  ASP, higher sales volume, and continued cost discipline.
ADRO generated industry-leading operational EBITDA  margin of 62% in FY22, an increase over 53% in FY21.
In the calculation of operational EBITDA, we excluded non- operational expense amounting $7.8 million.
In the Adaro  Group, we use operational EBITDA as the primary metric  to measure our operating performance.
We believe it is  useful for analysts and investors to compare and evaluate  our operational performance without regard to capital  structure or other non-operational items.
Our underlying core earnings in FY22 increased 140% to  $3.0 billion from $1.3 billion in FY21.
Our core earnings  exclude non-operational items net of tax which reflects the  quality performance of our core business and operational  excellence.
The company’s net profit increased 175% to  $2.8 billion from $1.0 billion in the year ago period.
Capital structure We seek to maintain a strong and flexible capital structure  to support growth and our capital expenditure plans as  well as shareholders return.
