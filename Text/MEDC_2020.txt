FINANCIAL REVIEW Anthony R.
Mathias Director & Chief Financial Officer Financial activity in the first half of 2020 was focused on mitigating  the financial impact of the low demand and rapid fall in energy prices  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
With significant uncertainty on  the timing of any economic recovery, the immediate financial priority  was the preservation of liquidity in order to meet the Company’s  obligations and also the maintenance of our financial covenants.
In April, in response to the impact of the pandemic, the Company  made plans to reduce 2020 operating and overhead costs and  capital budgets by US$200 million and revised our Oil & Gas  production guidance.
The Company closed the year with Oil & Gas production of   100 MBOEPD, generated Power sales of 2,639 GWh and reduced  expenditures by over US$200 million.
Total capital expenditures  were US$207 million and unit Oil & Gas cash costs were US$9.0/BOE.
Liability management and supportive shareholders enabled  the repayment and financing of US$1,038.5 million debt and an  increase in average loan life from 4.7 years to 5.2 years.
Liquids sales averaged 31.9 MBOPD in 2020, basically flat  with the 31.4 MBOPD in 2019, however gas sales fell to  302.2 BBTUPD down from 323.7 BBTUPD in 2019 due to the  drastic economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.
The  drop in gas sales is despite having a larger asset portfolio  in 2020, a full year of production from the Ophir assets  and the Meliwis gas development which was placed into  service in East Java.
Realized liquids prices in 2020 were   US$40.3/bbl, excluding revenue income from hedges, down from  the US$62.5/bbl in 2019.
Commodity linked gas prices fell to   US$4.2 per MMBTU from US$7.1 per MMBTU in 2019, while  consolidated average fixed gas price was relatively steady at   US$6.0 per MMBTU in 2020, compared to US$6.4 per MMBTU  in 2019.
Despite the very evident challenges of  2020 our supportive shareholders and  proactive liability management allowed  continued deleveraging; this has placed  the Company in a strong position to  benefit from the expected economic  recovery“ “ 22 Annual Report  2020  • PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk 02 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOil prices, along with other indices were extremely volatile in 2020  with the V-index peaking in quarter two, Brent opened the year  in January at US$66/bbl, reached a low of US$18/bbl in April  before eventually recovering to US$50/bbl in December.
In quarter  four the Company determined to take a number of asset write- downs and impairments.
The Company recorded a net loss of  US$189 million in 2020, including quarter four one-time non-cash   write-downs of US$93 million.
Asset impairments of approximately US$28 million were made  in Oil & Gas exploration and producing assets and a further   US$11 million reduced and restated the 2019 bargain purchase  booked on the Ophir acquisition.
The uncertain future of central  Jakarta property occupation rates and valuations resulted in a   US$45 million write-down in our minority holding in an Indonesian  property company that owns the MedcoEnergi Headquarters in  Jakarta.

Total sales revenues in 2020 dropped by 21%, with cost of sales and  other direct costs US$771.6 million, down 7% and selling, general  and administration expenses down by 30% to US$152.6 million due  to synergies associated with the Ophir acquisition contributing to  significant cost reduction efforts.
The Phase 7 development of the Nusa Tenggara mine reached  pit ore in April 2020 allowing AMNT to report a profit of   US$25 million in 2020 and to benefit from improved copper prices  which peaked at US$3.55/lbs in December.
Holding company   PT Amman Mineral Internasional (AMI) now owns the entire share  capital of AMNT, however the dilution of MedcoEnergi’s shareholding  in AMI to below 25% resulted in a US$19 million impairment. 23 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk • Annual Report 2020 MedcoEnergi successfully issued a US$650 million bond in  January 2020 and used the proceeds to retire a US$450 million  bond originally due in 2022, secure in escrow the repayment of  IDR bonds in 2021 and execute early repayment of IDR2.5 trillion   (US$178.6 million) of IDR bonds originally due in 2021.
A successful rights issue was initiated in quarter two and completed  in September.
The rights issue was 43% oversubscribed and raised  IDR1,785 trillion with 98% of shareholders subscribing.
With the  assurance of the rights issue in progress, the Company was able  to continue to execute its commitment of consistent quarterly  debt repayments, despite the uncertain price environment.
Medco  Power drew additional debt of US$56.4 million for the construction of the Riau IPP , but repaid debt of US$26.5 million, as well as  deconsolidated US$386.2 million debt in Sarulla.
As a result, consolidated debt at year end fell by   15%, US$467.5 million, from US$3,195.0 million in 2019 to  US$2,727.5 million in 2020.
Restricted group debt fell by   US$151.3 million following consistent quarterly debt repayments.
MedcoEnergi will maintain its net leverage target of 3.0x in 2021  for the restricted group of Oil & Gas assets and continue to reduce  debt quarter on quarter, with the expectation that commodity  prices will recover in the near term.

Oil & Gas capex was mainly spent  on the completion of the Meliwis gas development, East Java and  Cash Flowon four successful exploration wells in South Natuna Sea Block B.
Power capex was mainly spent on construction of the Riau 275 MW  CCGPP project and Ijen Geothermal exploration drilling. 25 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk • Annual Report 2020 As a result of cost reduction efforts, net cash provided by operating  activities rose from US$388.2 million in 2019 to US$458.2 million in  2020, despite the significantly lower revenue due to reduced energy  demand and lower liquids prices.
Liquidity and Dividends The Company was able to meet all maturing obligations in a  timely manner during 2020 and repay some obligations early.
MedcoEnergi’s liquidity position in 2020 remained solid with  adequate resources and facilities to meet both current and near- term liabilities.
No dividend distribution has been made in the past five years.
Business Prospects and Challenges The Company will continue to maintain strict protocols to mitigate  the risks from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Volatility in commodity prices  is expected to continue and gas demand remains weak in some of  key markets.
Therefore, the Company will continue its disciplined  approach to capital investment and its policy to maintain prudent  liquidity and proactive liability management.
