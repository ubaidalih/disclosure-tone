107 ANNUAL REPORT 2019  LAPORAN TAHUNAN  We, at PT Adaro Energy Tbk, delivered on our operational  and financial guidance for 2019 as we produced 58.03  million tonnes (Mt) of coal in 2019, a 7% growth year- over-year (y-o-y), beating our 2019 production guidance of  54–56 Mt.
Our sales increased 9% y-o-y to 59.18 Mt, a solid  performance amidst the challenging macro and industry  condition in 2019.
We booked operational EBITDA of US$1,207 million, 14%  lower y-o-y, and achieved the top-end of our operational  EBITDA guidance of US$1,000 million to US$1,200 million.
The decline in global coal prices affected our average  selling price (ASP), which declined 13% y-o-y.
We continued  with our focus on operational excellence and cost discipline  and managed to lower our coal cash cost (excluding royalty)  by 4% y-o-y.
Coal is a cyclical industry and the difficulties faced in 2019  affected our profitability.
Core earnings, our profit excluding  non-operational items, declined 13% y-o-y to US$635  million.
We maintained robust liquidity position at US$1,861  million, consisting of US$1,576 million in cash, including  the net proceeds of our bond issuance, US$6 million in  available-for-sale financial assets, and US$279 million in  undrawn committed loan facilities.
This level of liquidity  provides us with ample flexibility to execute our plans and  cover future debt payments.

Production from Tutupan mine was  approximately 67% of total coal production, while the rest  were from Paringin, Wara, Balangan Coal Companies  (Balangan), and Adaro MetCoal Companies (AMC).
Coal  production from Balangan increased 6% y-o-y to 5 Mt while  coal production from AMC increased 7% y-o-y to 1.09 Mt – in  line with their 2019 production guidance.
sales volume Total coal sales in 2019 reached 59.18 Mt, a 9% increase  y-o-y.
We are in compliance with the domestic market  obligation and – aside from Indonesia – we supply our  coal to around 17 countries.
Despite macro and industry  challenges in 2019, demand for our coal remained solid.
Customers continued to inquire for our Envirocoal product  as they recognize and value the low pollutant content of  the coal and the reliability of supply we provide.
Sales to  Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, constituted 42% of  total sales volume in 2019.
Our sales volume to Southeast  Asia increased 14% y-o-y.
Indonesia and Malaysia were our  two biggest markets in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, East Asia made up 29% of sales, followed by  India and China at 15% and 12%, respectively.
This is in line  with India’s higher coal import in 2019.
The following table  shows the geographical breakdown of customers in 2019.
We have a solid customer base and most of our customers  are sovereign-backed power plants, which we regard as  our long-term partners.
We continue to retain our long- term blue-chip customers while actively looking for new  customers.
Blended  average strip ratio in 2019 was 4.69x or above our planned  strip ratio of 4.56x as favorable weather throughout the year  supported more overburden removal activities.
We are still  in the range of our average life of mine strip ratio and thus,  able to maintain our long-term coal reserves.
operating segments, revenue and profit   We have an integrated business model across coal, energy,  utilities and supporting infrastructure sectors.
This  business model supports us on cost while at the same time  unfolds opportunities to capture optimal margins in the  entire business pillars.
Currently, more than 90% of AE’s  revenue is from coal mining business.
Our businesses are divided into four main business pillars,  namely Adaro Mining, Adaro Services, Adaro Logistics, and  Adaro Power.
We also have four supporting business pillars,  namely Adaro Land, Adaro Water, Adaro Capital, and Adaro  Foundation.
The transformation into eight business pillars  further strengthen our foundation for sustainable growth  and provide a more resilient and competitive position for  the longer term.
Our subsidiaries in the four main business pillars are  involved in each part of the coal supply chain, which  gives us better control over costs, improves efficiency  and reduces counterparty risks, including reducing the  likelihood of disruptions to our operations and expansion  plans.
This enables us to offer more reliable coal supply to  our customers, which in turn improves the marketability of  our coal.

Capital structure We seek to maintain a strong and flexible capital structure  to support growth and our capital expenditure plans as  well as shareholders return.
As a company operating in a  cyclical industry, we need to ensure that we have a strong  balance sheet through the cycle.
Although we do not have  specific target in term of indebtedness, we continue to abide  by our loan documents.
We actively and regularly review  and manage our capital to ensure optimal capital structure  and return to the shareholders, taking into consideration  the efficiency of capital use based on operating cash flows  and capital expenditure as well as consideration of future  capital needs.
Total liabilities as of end of 2019 were US$3.23 billion and total  equity was US$3.98 billion, or 45% and 55% correspondingly.
Our interest-bearing debts at the end of 2019 were US$1.96  billion, 37% higher than the corresponding period in 2018.
Liquidity remained robust and we recorded cash balance of  US$1.58 billion, resulting in net debt of US$375 million and  net debt to equity ratio of 0.09. 112 PT ADARO ENERGY TBK A SNAPShOT OF  ADARO ENERgy  SEKILAS ADARO  ENERGYA SNAPShOT OF  ADARO ENERgy  SEKILAS ADARO  ENERGYPARTNER IN ThE  CAPITAL MARKET MITRA PASAR  MODALCONSOLIDATED  FINACIAL STATEMENT LAPORAN KEUANGAN  KONSOLIDASIANMANAgEMENT  REPORT LAPORAN  MANAJEMENCORPORATE  gOVERNANCE TATA KELOLA  PERUSAHAANThE PIT-TO-POWER  BuSINESS BISNIS TAMBANG SAMPAI  KETENAGALISTRIKANSuSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT PEMBANGUNAN YANG  BERKELANJUTAN US$750 million bond issuance We continue to make prudent decision regarding our  borrowing activities and maintain access to relationship  banks and international debt capital markets.
In 2019, our  subsidiary PT Adaro Indonesia (AI) issued a five year US$750  million bond with a coupon of 4.25%.
The net proceeds of  the bonds will be used to repay a portion of AI’s existing  bank loans and for general corporate purposes.
The bond  diversifies our source of funds and extends our maturity  profile.
With a more diversified source of funds, we further  strengthened our capital structure which will provide us  with more flexibility to execute our growth plans and to face  market headwinds.
Total Liabilities Total liabilities went up by 17% y-o-y to US$3,234 million.
Current liabilities increased by 51% to US$1,233 million due  to higher dividend payables and higher current maturity of  long-term borrowings as portions of our bank loans are  maturing.
Non-current liabilities slightly increased by 3%  y-o-y to US$2,001 million.
Total Equity At the end of 2019, our equity level went down by 7% to  US$3,983 million compared to US$4,303 million in 2018.
The decrease was driven by lower non-controlling interest  as we ceased consolidating one of our subsidiaries in East  Kalimantan.
net revenue and average selling price (asp) We booked revenue of US$3,457 million in 2019, 4% lower  compared to 2018, mainly due to 13% lower ASP.
The decline  in ASP was offset by the 9% increase in coal sales y-o-y to  59.19 Mt.
We recorded 7% increase in production volume  to 58.03 Mt, higher than our guidance of 54-56 Mt.
Strong  operations performance and solid demand for our coal  supported the improvement.
Our coal mining and trading  division generated 92% of our revenue.
Cost of revenue  Our cost of revenue increased by 3% y-o-y to US$2,493  million, largely driven by higher production volume in  2019.
Our blended strip ratio for the period was 4.69x,  slightly higher than our guidance of 4.56x.
Coal cash cost  per tonne (excluding royalty) decreased by 4% y-o-y as  we  recorded higher production, lower strip ratio, and lower fuel  cost y-o-y.
We continued to maintain efficiency along our  vertically integrated coal supply chain.
Kami terus menjalankan efisiensi  di sepanjang rantai pasokan batu bara.  113 ANNUAL REPORT 2019  LAPORAN TAHUNAN  Total fuel consumption increased by 5% following the  increase in production volume y-o-y.
Meanwhile, fuel price  per liter went down by 5% y-o-y.
In 2019, we ended up hedging approximately 20% of our  fuel requirements for the year at prices below our budget,  in order to manage risk arising from fuel price fluctuations,  while at the moment we have hedged approximately 5% of  our fuel requirements for 2020 at prices below our budget.
royalties to government Royalties to the Government of Indonesia increased slightly  by 1% y-o-y to US$383 million due to higher sales volume  y-o-y.
operational eBiTda Our operational EBITDA in 2019 was US$1,207 million, a 14%  decrease from US$1,408 million in 2018, and slightly higher  than our 2019 operational EBITDA guidance of US$1,000- US$1,200 million.
Our operational EBITDA margin remains  healthy at 35%.
We excluded US$68.6 million of loss on  disposal of fixed assets, and loss on derivative financial  instruments and impairment in investments in joint ventures  related to our investment in a low CV coal asset in East  Kalimantan totaling to US$34.5 million.
Both items are one-time, non-operational expense.
Operational EBITDA is the primary metric we use to  measure our operating performance as we believe it is  useful for analysts and investors to compare and evaluate  our operational performance without regard to capital  structure or other non-operational items.
Core earnings Our underlying core earnings in 2019 was US$635 million,  13% lower y-o-y.
Our core earnings exclude non-operational  items net of tax.
We were able to achieve solid core earnings  amid the global pressure on coal prices, a testimony to the  resilient performance of our core business and operational  excellence.

We separate these items and exclude them from the  calculation of our operational EBITDA and core earnings  to provide a better understanding and comparative basis of  our underlying financial performance.
We disposed a fixed asset in 2019 as the asset no longer  generates cash flow due to change in our business model  and mine plan.
We recorded US$68 million on the loss of  disposal and US$7.3 million in decommissioning cost of  said fixed asset.
The loss on investment in derivatives and impairment of  investments in joint venture is related to our investment in a  low CV coal asset in East Kalimantan.
The loss on investment  in derivatives of US$25 million and the impairment of  investments in joint venture of US$9.5 million was a result  of the decline in value of our 10.22% stake.
Transactions and Balances with related parties In the normal course of business, we engage in transactions  with related parties.
The transactions primarily consist of  services and other financial transactions.
In dealing with related parties we ensure that all transactions  are fair and at arm’s length by doing the followings: 1.
Determining the pricing policies of coal sales to  related parties based on international benchmarks,  adjusted to the coal specifications. 2.
Treating our mining services and logistics  subsidiaries as third-party service providers and  benchmark the fees of their services to that of  external service providers from outside of the  Adaro Group performing similar activities for the  group.
In 2019, AE recorded revenue from sales of  coal to TPI amounting US$12.6 million and revenue from  management and consulting services to TPI and BPI of  US$0.43 million and US$0.50 million, respectively.
Total  revenue from related parties was US$13.52 million, or  0.39% of AE’s revenue.
AE also had US$107.5 million loan to  BEP at the end of 2019, or 1.49% of AE’s total consolidated  assets.
Cash Flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities increased 1% to  US$917 million, as a result of 7% and 25% y-o-y decline in  payment of royalty and income tax, respectively.
Cash Flows used in investing activities We booked US$539 million in net cash flows used in  investing activities, 33% lower y-o-y mainly due to purchase  of fixed assets.
Cash Flows from Financing activities In 2019, net cash flow from financing activities was US$263  million, consisting of, among others, US$742 million from  the net proceeds of AI’s bond, US$200 million in dividend  payment and US$276 million in repayments of bank loans.
dividend Recognizing the importance of cash returns to  shareholders, we continue to pay regular cash dividends to  our shareholders.
We have not adopted a specific policy on  dividend and the BoD will assess the company’s ability to  pay dividend at every reporting period and the AGMS decides  on the final dividend amount.
We determine our dividend  amount in US Dollar (USD), our functional currency, and pay  in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR).
Currency conversion is based  on the USD/IDR exchange rate on the record date.
In the year 2019, we distributed a total cash dividend  of US$200.2 million or 48% of our FY18 net income,  comprising interim cash dividend of US$75.2 million paid  on 15 January 2019, and a final cash dividend of US$125.1  million paid on 24 May 2019.
For the year 2019, as approved  at our Board of Commissioners and Directors meeting held  on 19 December 2019, an interim cash dividend of US$150.0  million (US$0.00469/share) was paid on 15 January 2020.
We have never missed a single dividend payment since  going public in 2008 and have paid more than US$1.4 billion  in dividend with average payout ratio of approximately 40%.
Dividend distribution is always based on prudent analysis  on company’s requirement and target on yearly basis.
Current maturity of long-term Borrowings The current portion of long-term borrowings increased  more than two-folds compared to the same period the  previous year to US$551 million as some portions of our  bank loans are maturing.
long-term Borrowings, net of Current maturity The non-current portion of long-term borrowings increased  16% y-o-y to US$1,406 million, compared to the same  period last year due to the proceeds of our bonds issuance.
debt management and liquidity At the end of 2019, our liquidity level remained robust at  US$1,861 million, consisting of US$1,576 million in cash,  including the net proceeds of our bond issuance, US$6  million in available for sale financial assets, and US$279  million in undrawn committed loan facilities.
Our bank loans  were US$1,058 million, 16% lower y-o-y as we continued to  make regular loan payments.
Our balance sheet remained  healthy with net debt of US$375 million, net debt to last 12  months operational EBITDA of 0.31x and net debt to equity  of 0.09x.
Capital expenditure and Free Cash Flow We spent US$489 million in capital expenditure in 2019,  1% lower compared to 2018, and in-line with our 2019  capital expenditure guidance of US$450-US$600 million.
In  2019, our capital expenditure allocation was mainly for the  development of our metallurgical coal asset, purchase and  replacement of heavy equipment, and regular maintenance.
We generated free cash flow of US$566 million, 14% lower  y-o-y, along with the decline in operational EBITDA.
mitigation of Foreign exchange risk Our business activities are exposed to a number of financial  risks, such as market risk (including foreign exchange risk,  commodity price risk and interest rate risk), credit risk  and liquidity risk.
We use various risk mitigation methods,  including sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rates,  foreign exchange and other price risks and aging analysis  for credit risk.
Kami  menggunakan berbagai alat mitigasi risiko, antara lain  dengan melakukan analisis sensitivitas untuk risiko suku  bunga, risiko nilai tukar dan risiko harga lainnya, serta  analisis umur piutang untuk risiko kredit. 117 ANNUAL REPORT 2019  LAPORAN TAHUNAN  With regards to foreign exchange risk, the financing and  the majority of revenue and operating expenditure of our  operating subsidiaries are denominated in US Dollars,  which indirectly represents a natural hedge on exposure to  foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
However, we are exposed  to foreign exchange risk arising from dividend payments to  the shareholders and other operating expenses in rupiah.
Management has set up a policy to require companies  within the group to manage their foreign exchange risk  against their functional currency.
As at 31 December 2019,  if the Rupiah had weakened/strengthened by 10% against  the US Dollar with all other variables held constant, the  post-tax profit for the year would have been US$1.51 million  lower or US$2.83 million higher, respectively, mainly as a  result of foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of  cash and cash equivalents, restricted time deposits, trade  receivables, trade payables and accrued expenses.
Business prospect We continue to believe that the fundamentals for coal  market are solid, supported by developing economies  especially in the Southeast Asia and South Asia region.
The  growing requirement for electricity to support increased  urbanization and economic growth in those regions will  become the underlying factor.
Metallurgical coal market will be shaped by China’s steel  and mining sectors industries.
India, however, will continue  to push the demand sector alongside its urbanization and  industrialization growth.
Supplying these demand growth  will primarily be Australia, although supplies from Russia  and Indonesia will increase competition in Asian market.
We understand that coal is cyclical and therefore have laid  out the foundation to diversify our business in order to  counterbalance it and provide a more stable earnings base.
The development of our non-coal mining businesses is  positive.

We expect flat to 7%  lower production volume y-o-y of 54-58 Mt in 2020.
As we  expect pressure on coal prices, we anticipate by adjusting  our strip ratio guidance to 4.30x to help us in controlling our  cost.
This strip ratio guidance is 8% lower compared to our  actual strip ratio in 2019.
We anticipate lower operational EBITDA of US$900– US$1,200 million in 2020, flat to 25% lower compared to our  achievement in 2019 of US$1,207 million as we expect the  challenging market environment to result in lower average  coal prices y-o-y.
Hence we are mindful with our capex plan  and target capex of US$300 – US$400 million compared to  US$489 million in 2019, or 18% to 25% lower y-o-y.
stable earnings Contribution from Coal-Fired power plant We believe that building a coal-fired power plant maximizes  value creation from thermal coal.
In 2019, we successfully  achieved commercial operations for a 2x100 MW power  plant in South Kalimantan owned by one of our joint  venture companies, PT Tanjung Power Indonesia.
This fully  operational power plants requires approximately 1 Mtpa of  coal which we will supply from our coal concessions nearby.
On top of providing captive demand for our coal, this power  plant will also provide us with stable earnings and therefore  safeguard our bottom line from the volatility of coal price.
Selain menyediakan  permintaan captive untuk batubara kami, pembangkit listrik  ini juga akan memberi kami penghasilan yang stabil dan  karenanya menjaga laba kami dari volatilitas harga batubara. 119 ANNUAL REPORT 2019  LAPORAN TAHUNAN  Targets and results in 2019, guidance for 2020 Although we had expected macroeconomic and industry  headwinds in 2019, we did not anticipate the level of  difficulties experienced in the year.
Low gas prices in early  2019 increased the competition for coal particularly in  Europe, causing coal shipments to be reallocated to the  Asia-Pacific market.
The supply and demand imbalance  added more to the already pressured coal prices in the  region.
In the face of those challenges, 2019 recorded a new  high for seaborne thermal coal trade, which went pass the  1 Bt level.
We delivered total coal production of 58.03 Mt in 2019, 7%  higher y-o-y and surpassing our 2019 production guidance  of 54 Mt to 56 Mt.
Our revenue in 2019 was US$3,457 million,  5% lower compared to 2018, mainly due to 13% lower ASP.
The decline in ASP was offset by the 9% increase in coal  sales y-o-y to 59.18 Mt.
Strong operations performance and  solid demand for our coal supported the improvement.
Blended strip ratio for the year was 4.69x, higher than  our guidance of 4.56x, as a result of strong operations,  strong output from our contractors, and favorable weather  condition throughout the year.
We continued to focus on cost  discipline across our operations and were able to deliver  operational EBITDA of US$1,207 million, in-line with our  guidance of US$1,000-US$1,200 million.
We maintained  a strong balance sheet with robust liquidity position at  US$1,861 million, which provides us with ample flexibility  to cover future debt payments.
We spent US$489 million  for capital expenditure in 2019, in-line with our guidance of  US$450 million to US$600 million.
Acknowledging the cyclical nature of coal and increased  market challenge we pared down our guidance and target  for 2020.
We expect coal production of 54 Mt to 58 Mt, flat  to 7% lower y-o-y as we focus on management of our coal  reserves.
We target a lower blended strip ratio of 4.30x  as we would like to control our cost and maintain our  healthy margins.
Although we are adjusting our strip ratio  downward, we have the flexibility to do so without harming  our long-term reserves.
Operational EBITDA guidance for 2020 is in the range  of US$900 million to US$1,200 million while capital  expenditure is expected to be in the range of US$300 million  to US$400 million predominantly for regular maintenance,  heavy equipment purchase and replacement, and the  development of AMC.
Pedoman EBITDA operasional untuk tahun 2020 berada  di kisaran AS$900 juta hingga AS$1.200 juta, sementara  belanja modal diperkirakan berada di kisaran AS$ 300  juta hingga AS$ 400 juta terutama untuk pemeliharaan  rutin, pembelian dan penggantian alat berat, serta  pengembangan AMC. 120 PT ADARO ENERGY TBK A SNAPShOT OF  ADARO ENERgy  SEKILAS ADARO  ENERGYA SNAPShOT OF  ADARO ENERgy  SEKILAS ADARO  ENERGYPARTNER IN ThE  CAPITAL MARKET MITRA PASAR  MODALCONSOLIDATED  FINACIAL STATEMENT LAPORAN KEUANGAN  KONSOLIDASIANMANAgEMENT  REPORT LAPORAN  MANAJEMENCORPORATE  gOVERNANCE TATA KELOLA  PERUSAHAANThE PIT-TO-POWER  BuSINESS BISNIS TAMBANG SAMPAI  KETENAGALISTRIKANSuSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT PEMBANGUNAN YANG  BERKELANJUTAN adaro energy’s achievement 2019 | pencapaian adaro energy 2019 2019 guidance panduan 20192019 actual aktual 20192019 actual vs  2019 guidance  Coal Production (Mt)         54 - 56 58.03 Higher Produksi Batu Bara (Mt)  Blended Strip Ratio 4.56x 4.69x Higher Nisbah Kupas Gabungan  Operational EBITDA (US$ million) 1,000 – 1,200 1,207 Higher  EBITDA Operasional (AS$ juta) Capex (US$ million) 450 – 600 489 in-line Belanja Modal (AS$ juta) marketing overview The thermal coal market faced a challenging year in 2019  due to the various pressures from government’s policies,  structural changes in some importing countries, slower  economic growth, mild winter in the northern hemisphere,  higher carbon price, and lower LNG prices.
In particular, the  structural changes occurred on the demand from Europe  due to higher renewable power generation.
Weakening  global economy, US-China trade tensions, and increase in  the use of renewables, nuclear and gas in East Asia also  added to the challenges.
Despite the price pressure and declining coal demand  in the Atlantic market, coal had continued to be the most  affordable and reliable source of energy.
As such, coal  remained dominant in global energy systems, where it  accounts for almost 40% of electricity generation.
Seaborne  coal trades recorded volume exceeding 1 Bt for the first time  in 2019, with demand mostly attributable to Asian countries,  which had outpaced the decline in Europe and North  America.
With European thermal coal market collapsing,  traditional Atlantic producers have switched focus to these  Asian markets as coal demand in Asia continued to grow.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the  Asian region’s share of global coal power generation had  climbed from just over 20% in 1990 to almost 80% in 2019.
The metallurgical coal market concluded 2019 with the  Platts Premium Low-Vol price averaging at US$177.21,  or down by 14% y-o-y, yet still above the marginal costs.
The price of Premium Low Vol Hard Coking Coal (PLV HCC)  started stronger in the first half, before moving downward  and recorded a 26% decline in the second half, when  the coking coal market was impacted by China’s import  restriction.
However, China total imports of coking coal  was up by 10 Mt or 15% y-o-y on the back of strong steel  production that reached almost 1 Bt in 2019 as a result  of economic stimuli released to counterbalance the tepid  global demand.
In addition to China, India also remained one  of the bright spots for coking coal exports, with its major  projects moving in the pipeline.
AE’s sales to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia,  constituted 42% of total sales volume in 2019.
Our sales  volume to Southeast Asia increased 14% y-o-y with  Indonesia and Malaysia as our two biggest markets in  the region.
Meanwhile, East Asia made up 29% of sales,  followed by India and China at 15% and 12%, respectively.
Despite increasing pressure in the short-term, we remain  positive on the long-term fundamentals of thermal and  metallurgical coal markets supported by the Southeast Asia  and South Asia region as these regions pursue economic  development, increase industrialization, and improve their  power sector.
Over the last few years, AE’s core business of coal mining  has grown and we have expanded our product offerings as  well as improved our reserves base.
In 2019, we continued to  build upon the strong foundation of operational excellence  and solid customer relations and was able to achieve our  coal production target amid market headwinds.
Our marketing efforts are supported by differentiated  market positioning due to the ultra-low pollutants content  of our coal and our reputation as a reliable and dependable  supplier.
We continue to work on strengthening our  relationships with our customers through our established  marketing and technical capabilities and to provide top class  customer service emphasizing consistent coal quality and  reliability of supply.
On our non-coal mining businesses, we  will continue to add more third-party volume while continue  to support the Adaro Group’s growth, and further develop  the businesses to capture growth opportunities.
Despite the  significance of coal mining to our profitability, the non-coal  mining continue to contribute and it is our objective to grow  the non-coal mining pillars to provide us with stable returns  and balance the volatility of coal.
On that front, under the  non-coal mining pillars, we executed these activities in 2019.
