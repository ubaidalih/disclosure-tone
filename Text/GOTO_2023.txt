PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk  Laporan Tahunan  2023138 KILAS KINERJA PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTSLAPORAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT REPORTPROFIL PERUSAHAAN COMPANY PROFILEPENDAHULUAN PREFACE TINJAUAN MAKROEKONOMI DAN INDUSTRI MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  THE SOUTHEAST ASIA AND INDONESIA MACRO  ECONOMY Our business operates across multiple markets in Southeast  Asia with different, yet interconnected, economies.
Global  macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical tensions have led to  falling external demand and slowing economic growth for most, if  not all, countries in the region.
According to the Asia Development Bank’s (ADB) latest report,  the region’s economic expansion forecast is revised down from  4.6% to 4.3% in 2023.
Despite ripples from global downturn, each  country has its unique drivers which enabled them to offset the  drag from slower economic momentum.
Based on the ADB report,    Singapore and Vietnam are expected to experience GDP growth of  1.0% and 5.2% in 2023.
Indonesia’s economy showed upbeat growth in 2023 and is believed  to continue the momentum, supported by rising spending and  continued capital and fixed investment, including infrastructure  projects.
Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik/BPS) data  showed that the economy recorded a real full-year GDP growth of  5.05%.
GDP grew at 5.04% in the last quarter of 2023, which was  driven by household consumptions and investments amounting  to 18.11% and 5.02% year-on-year respectively.
Strong domestic  consumption also continued to sustain the economic expansion,  relieving the pressure of weakening external demand.
According  to Google, Temasek, and Bain & Co, Indonesia’s consumer  confidence is starting to rebound in Q42023 from its lowest point  in the past four years.
INDONESIA’S DIGITAL ECONOMY In its e-Conomy SEA 2023 report, Google, Temasek, and Bain & Co  highlighted that investors hit the brakes on funding due to higher  cost of capital.
This shifted investors and technology companies’  focus from user acquisition and rapid growth to profitability and  financial sustainability.
The core digital economy in Southeast  Asia is poised to record USD218 billion in Gross Merchandise Value  (GMV) and USD70 billion in revenue in 2023, compared to USD195  billion and USD57 billion in 2022.
The figure implies that revenue  grew at 1.7x the rate of GMV, as the digital businesses focused more  on monetization in a bid to realize profitability targets.

Indonesia’s total GMV is expected to grow  by 8% CAGR from USD76 billion to USD82 billion in 2023, with an  average growth rate of 15% from 2023-2025, while Indonesia’s  GDP continues to expand at 9% in the same time period.
The digital  economy will continue to be a crucial growth driver in Indonesia.
The study also noted that there was a trend of cost optimization to  accelerate the path to profitability.
In Indonesia alone, reduction of  promotions and incentives have taken place across e-commerce,  food delivery and transportation players.
These come at the  expense of eroding the price-sensitive consumer segment and  hence slower GMV and revenue growth.
However, this strategy  unveils the high value users, who based on average online vertical  spend per user would spend 6.8x of the price-sensitive or the non- high value users.
Focusing on these high value users will pave its  way towards sustainable unit economics.
ON-DEMAND SERVICES As Covid 19-related restrictions have been lifted, mobility in  Indonesia is starting to return to pre-pandemic levels.
Resurgence  of offline activities has revived commuter demand for travel  and mobility, including door-to-door transportation services.
Consumers also showed an increased appetite for dining out, while  the demand for food delivery remain strong post-pandemic.
In the beginning of 2023, Google, Temasek, and Bain & Co  forecasted the GMV of transport and food delivery segments could  reach USD7 billion by the end of the year with a strong outlook of  double digit growth for the next two years, despite the reduction of  commissions and promotions across the industry.
E-COMMERCE Despite the resurgence of offline activities, the outlook of the  e-commerce market in Indonesia remains resilient, underpinned by  irreversible offline-to-online behaviour.
In the beginning of 2023,  the e-commerce market is expected to contribute USD62 billion or  approximately 75% of the total GMV by the end of the year, hence  becoming the largest contributor of the overall Indonesian digital  economy.
However, the digital participation landscape varies  across the country.

This gives room for e-commerce  players to penetrate and spur higher consumers' usage and spend.
FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY  The regulatory aspect continues to play an important role in driving  significant growth in the key digital economy sectors in Indonesia,  particularly for financial technology.
The outbreak of Covid-19  encouraged Indonesia's central bank to promote cashless  transactions and develop nationwide digital payment standards  and frameworks, which contributed to the acceleration of digital  payments adoption in the country.
In 2023, digital payment maintained its position as the biggest  contributor of Indonesia’s digital finance services, while the market  saw an upsurge in digital lending services.
The study by Google,  Temasek, and Bain & Co shows that the Gross Transaction Value  (GTV) for digital payments (which includes the credit, debit, prepaid  card, account-to-account (A2A) and e-wallet transactions) is  expected to reach USD313 billion this year.
Digital lending shows  potential for 27% growth in 2023, with the loan book balance  for consumer and Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) loans at  approximately USD6 billion.
LOGISTICS Macroeconomic performance, consumer purchasing power,  economic mobility and consumer spending preferences have  an impact on the national courier and logistics industry.
The  Indonesian Logistics Association (ALI) revealed that last-mile  delivery managed to record a 40% growth during the pandemic.
The national courier and logistics industry needs innovation in order  to maintain competitiveness going forward.
We present the following discussion and analysis of our financial  condition and results of operations, which should be read in line  with GoTo Group’s audited consolidated financial statements  and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
In  the discussion, we include forward-looking statements that may  involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results and the timing of  selected events could differ materially from what is mentioned in  forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including  those as set forth in this Annual Report and our prospectus.
Our  consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with  Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) and our  fiscal year ends on December 31, 2023.

The indicators for our contribution  include the resilience of GoTo’s partners in how they generate  consistent or increasing income.
According to a 2023 survey by LPEM FEB UI, as the largest digital  ecosystem in Indonesia, GoTo’s integrated technology ecosystem  has helped Gojek and GoTo Financial’s partners to have an average  increase in income of 5%.
Meanwhile, merchant partners that  joined the Tokopedia platform continue to generate consistent  revenue.
The survey estimates that GoTo contributed about 1.8%- 2.2% to total national GDP in 2022.
Throughout 2023, our mission to “Empower Progress” was  reflected through our consistency in driving interaction, fair  representation and opportunities for everyone from all levels of  society.
This was done by providing products and solutions that  enable us to contribute to financial inclusion and the country’s  economic growth.
GoTo expects to see more people benefitting  and participating in the emerging digital economy in Indonesia in  the years ahead.
OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS Through our comprehensive digital platforms, our customers can  access the following services:  •  Gojek for on-demand services (including mobility, food delivery  and logistics); •  Tokopedia for e-commerce (including third-party marketplace  and official stores that offer a vast selection of digital goods  and services); and •  GoTo Financial for financial technology (including consumer  payments, lending and merchant services).
• GoTo Logistics for logistics solutions (including delivery and  fulfilment service), in which its main purpose is to support the  e-commerce segment.
As of December 31, 2023, we successfully generated 50.8 million  Annual Transacting Users (ATU), supported by 20.1 million  registered merchants and 3.1 million registered driver-partners.
Note:  1 GTV for 2022 is based on actual historical operating information of GoTo Group and is aligned to follow the current year segment presentation.
There  is no change in total GTV.
GOTO GROUP’S OVERALL STRATEGY Against the backdrop of an increasingly competitive landscape  and to increase the Group’s GTV, we continue to drive innovation  and fuel monetization through value-added products and services  across our comprehensive digital platforms while keeping a  disciplined expense management approach.
The strategies to expand our total addressable market through  product and service innovations helped the Company to reach a  wider consumer base which is the baseline for future monetization  initiatives.
We also continued to unlock strong synergies across our  ecosystem, which led to an increase in cross-selling transactions.
Alongside our efforts to drive monetization and generate higher  gross revenues to achieve our profitability target, we also continued  to expand our customer base and the engagement level across our  ecosystem.
Our platform is increasingly entrenched in the lives and  businesses of users within our ecosystem.
We are leveraging our  marketplace model, proprietary data capabilities, and ecosystem  synergies to offer a range of value-added services to our merchants  and help our merchants better manage and grow their business.
For the year 2023,  our GTV declined by 1% to Rp606.5 trillion from  Rp613.4 trillion in 2022 while our gross revenue has increased by 6%  to Rp24.3 trillion compared to Rp23.0 trillion in 2022.
Notes:  1 Financial information for 2022 is based on actual historical financial information of GoTo Group and is aligned to follow the current year segment presentation.
There is no change in total gross revenues.
ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS We leverage synergies within our ecosystem, which has strong  self-reinforcing network effects.
Our integrated digital technology  ecosystem has benefited all stakeholders in the ecosystem- consumers, merchants and driver-partners.
A study by LPEM FEB  UI released in June 2023 showed that the integration of GoTo’s  platforms propels the growth of our platform and also supports our  partners even amid the recovery of offline activities.

Our wide range of services- which consist of GoCar Reguler/Luxe/Premium, GoCorp,  GoTransit, Transport Insurance, Protect+ and GoCar L/XL  - not only enhance our mobility offerings but also allow us  to increase our take rate on an aggregate basis over time.
•  Food Delivery : The food delivery segment generates revenues  based on commissions charged to merchants and is calculated  as a percentage of the merchandise value.
Adding to that,  the segment’s other source of revenues is derived through  commissions we charge to driver-partners, which is based on  a percentage of the booking value.
This is in addition to the flat  rate platform fee we charge to consumers.
We continue to drive  monetization potential through value added services such as  advertising, food pick-up and cloud kitchens to our merchants.
•  Logistics : The primary source of revenues of our logistics  segment comes from our consumer-to-consumer (C2C)  service, GoSend, which is accessible from the Gojek app.
For  this product, we charge a percentage of the delivery fees.
Following the removal of the pandemic-related restrictions policy  at the end of 2022, according to Google, Temasek, and Bain & Co’s  study, performances of on-demand services industry remained  faced fluctuations.
While the mobility segment was thriving,  performance of the food delivery segment was moderate.
However, our efforts to boost operational efficiency by reducing   redundancies and optimizing our  technology to cut costs, helped  to strengthen the performance of our On-Demand Services  segment, which achieved positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth  quarter of the year.
Throughout the year we introduced multiple products to expand  our market reach and eventually supported our GTV recovery.
The  launches of these new products and services are :  •  GoTo introduced GoTransit, the worlds first platform that  integrates public transportation and mobility services in a  single order using the Gojek app.
•  GoCar Hemat was introduced as a affordable transportation  service.
Compared to the driver-partners that do not take  the GoCar Hemat orders, those who take both type of orders  saw an increase of over 35% in their orders per hour.
With the  strong performance of GoCar Hemat, we have since expanded  the operational coverage of GoCar Hemat while encouraging  operational efficiency.
•  GoTo introduced a pilot for GoRide Nego to increase orders for  its driver-partners.
GoRide Nego allows consumers and our  driver-partners to negotiate fees directly.
• We continued to broaden the options under our GoFood Mode  Hemat offering, thereby increasing orders, improving batching  and lowering costs.
Compared to the driver-partners that do  not take the GoFood Mode Hemat orders, those who take both  types of orders saw their orders per hour tripled.
As we continued to drive monetization, the On-Demand Services  segment’s take rate improved from 19.6% in 2022 to 22.3% in 2023.
This improvement is a result of our value-added propositions  that are available across our Mobility, Food Delivery and Logistic  services.
E-COMMERCE Our e-commerce segment primarily derives revenues from the  following sources: •  Merchant Commissions : Our integrated technology platforms  empower merchants by providing them with value-added  services, including pricing and competitive insights, customer  and traffic insights, online store and inventory management  and a myriad of marketing tools.
Commission rates applied to merchants  vary, based on the relative scale of their operations and the  category of goods or services being sold.
Typically, business- to-consumer (B2C) merchants and higher margin product  categories are subject to higher commission rates compared  to smaller scale C2C sellers and product categories with  lower margins.
As a result, the take rate for e-commerce may  fluctuate over time depending on category mix and the relative  contribution from C2C vs B2C merchants.
•  Consumer Platform Fee : Our approach to engage our high  quality users is built around offering a broad selection of  products and strong customer experience.
We enhance the  consumer experience through the expansion of superior  logistics, payment and customer service infrastructure.
As  of the end of 2023, we charge a platform fee of Rp1,000  (approximately USD0.06) per transaction to consumers,  which is largely used to enhance the platform’s features  and consumer experience when they transact within our  e-commerce ecosystem.
Although consumer platform fees are  relatively nascent for Tokopedia, this fee structure may evolve  over time as we strive to optimize both consumer experience  and our monetization potential.
•  Advertising: Our platforms are designed to facilitate  merchants to boost their brand recognition by advertising their  products through digital banners, priority search placements  and prioritized search keywords.
The advertising inventory  optimization and improved search and personalization  algorithms are expected to grow ads revenues.
In 2023, GTV of the e-commerce segment declined by 9% to  Rp248,836 billion from Rp273,146 billion in 2022.
Meanwhile, gross  revenues increased by 11% to Rp9,123 billion from Rp8,228 billion  in 2022.
GoTo Group continued to drive monetization for the e-commerce  segment through merchant commissions, consumer platform fees,  and improvement of value added services, including advertising  as well as logistics and fulfillment.
In 2023, the e-commerce  segment’s take rate improved from 3.0% in 2022 to 3.7% in 2023.
We charge transaction fees to  merchants who offer GoPay as a payment method to settle  their transactions.
With the increasing adoption of GoPay  as a payment method, this year we officially launched a  standalone  GoPay app to enhance the consumer experience  as they transact in our ecosystem.
We also launched GoPay  Savings by Jago, which offers easy access to various types  of bank accounts, catering to different needs and financial  goals.
Accessible via the GoPay app, GoPay Tabungan by  Jago comprises two types of account: (1) main account for  daily expenses, (2) savings account which allows users to save  money for rainy days and future needs from as little as Rp1.
Users have the option to choose between conventional main  account or shariah main account.
•  Financial Services:  We consistently  innovate our financial  services.
This boosts revenues through fees and interest from  our digital lending products, such as GoPay Later (BNPL) and  GoPay Pinjam (Cash Loans) developed in collaboration with  our banking partner, PT Bank Jago Tbk.
As of the end of 2023,  our total loan outstanding balance is Rp1.9 trillion.
Our financial  services segment has growth potential, especially with the  deepening integration with Tokopedia app enabling seamless  integration with our digital lending products.
In the meantime,  we are continuing to drive monetization to attract users from  the unbanked and underserved segments of the population  in Indonesia.
Through our robust credit scoring systems that  leverage our unique user data insights, we are able to provide  financial services products tailored to the specific needs of  each individual.
•  Merchant Services : Our merchant services comprise of various  offerings, including subscription-based merchant solutions  (notably from Cloud POS services) and payment gateways  services, from which we generate revenue by charging fees  PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk  Laporan Tahunan  2023148 KILAS KINERJA PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTSLAPORAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT REPORTPROFIL PERUSAHAAN COMPANY PROFILEPENDAHULUAN PREFACE for the provision of payment processing services.
Our suite of  merchant services can attract new and high-growth merchants  by cross-selling our offerings to our other merchant base in the  ecosystem, including the GoFood and Tokopedia platform.
In 2023 financial technology GTV increased by 5% to Rp379,739  billion from Rp360,447 billion in 2022.
Meanwhile, gross revenues  increased by 15% to Rp1,878 billion from Rp1,636 billion in 2022.
The increase in GTV for financial technology can be attributed to  various factors, including the following: •  Expansion of use cases for our GoPay payment services to be  more widely acceptable across online and offline platforms.
•  GoPay app has been capturing broader market segment  and therefore resulted into additional transactions executed  through our payment service.
We monetize the financial technology platform through transaction  and subscription fees.
Our financial technology take rate improved  from 0.3% in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023.
We consistently introduce  innovations to scale up our lending services so as to increase the  financial technology service segment take rate in the future.
LOGISTICS Logistics and Fulfillment : Our extensive logistics capabilities help  address delivery issues.
Merchants can offer their customers a wide  range of delivery options, including regular, same-day, and instant  delivery services.
All the delivery services are provided through  GoTo Logistics’s B2B2C logistics service (GoKilat) or through third- party logistics service providers.
GoKilat’s take rate is charged  based on distance.
At the same time, we continued to expand our  fulfillment service, “Dilayani Tokopedia” (Fulfilled by Tokopedia).
We provide warehousing and fulfillment services to merchants.
This  service allows merchants to expand their geographical coverage,  while enhancing the consumer experience for a faster and more  efficient delivery service.
To supplement GoTo Group’s consolidated financial statements,  which are prepared and presented in accordance with SFAS in  Indonesia, GoTo Group uses the following non-SFAS financial  measures including gross revenues, adjusted EBITDA and  contribution margin, to understand and evaluate GoTo Group’s  core operating performance.
However, the definitions of GoTo  Group’s non-SFAS financial measures may be different from those  used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable.
Furthermore, these non-SFAS financial measures have certain  limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain  expenses that are reflected in GoTo Group’s consolidated financial  statements that are necessary to run GoTo Group’s business.
Thus, these non-SFAS financial measures should be considered  in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures  prepared in accordance with SFAS.
GoTo Group’s gross revenues represent the total rupiah value  attributable to GoTo Group from each transaction, without  any adjustments for incentives paid to driver-partners and  merchant partners or promotions to end-users, over the period of  measurement.

Rather, GoTo Group believes that the presentation of  Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors to  facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding  those items that GoTo Group does not believe are indicative of  GoTo Group’s ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 COMPARED TO  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 Net revenues GoTo Group’s net revenues represent gross revenues after  deducting the incentives and promotion to customers.
GoTo  Group’s net revenues increased by 30% to Rp14,785 billion in   2023 from Rp11,349 billion in 2022.
This increase was due to (i) an  increase in GoTo Group’s gross revenues by 6% to Rp24,260 billion  in 2023 from Rp22,927 billion in 2022; (ii) tightening of incentives  to customers that GoTo Group have been implementing since early  2023 which were reduced by 18% to Rp9,475 billion in 2023 from  Rp11,578 billion in 2022.
Cost of revenues GoTo Group’s cost of revenues decreased by 7% to Rp5,093 billion  in 2023 from Rp5,480 billion in 2022, primarily due to our in-house  mapping technology, which has enabled us to gradually lower  our reliance on third-parties and contributed to the decrease of  information technology infrastructure costs.
GoTo Group’s total  cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues also improved  to 34% in 2023 as compared to 48% in 2022.
Sales and marketing expenses GoTo Group’s sales and marketing expenses decreased by 54%  to Rp6,431 billion in 2023 from Rp14,088 billion in 2022, primarily  due to incentives rationalization and cost discipline on product  marketing spending during 2023.
General and administrative expenses GoTo Group’s general and administrative expenses decreased  by 56% to Rp5,647 billion in 2023 from Rp12,706 billion in 2022,  primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation  expense  from share options granted to GoTo Group’s employees.
Product development expenses GoTo Group’s product development expenses decreased by 24%  to Rp3,517 billion in 2023 from Rp4,642 billion in 2022, primarily due  to a decrease in share-based compensation expense from share  options granted to GoTo Group’s employees.
Depreciation and amortization expenses GoTo Group’s depreciation and amortization expenses decreased  by 8% to Rp2,671 billion in 2023 from Rp2,913 billion in 2022,   primarily due to fully amortized assets during 2023.
Operational and support expenses GoTo Group’s operational and support expenses decreased by 8%  to Rp1,705 billion in 2023 from Rp1,850 billion in 2022, primarily due  to savings in contracted services.
Foreign exchange (loss)/gain, net GoTo Group recorded net foreign exchange loss, of Rp174 billion  in 2023, as compared to foreign exchange gain of Rp797 billion  in 2022, primarily due to GoTo Group’s cash and cash equivalents  balance in US dollar and the strengthening of Rupiah in 2023 from  Rp15,731 per US dollar at the end of December 2022 to Rp15,416  per US dollar at the end of December 2023.
Loss on goodwill GoTo Group’s loss on goodwill increased by 616% to Rp78,768  billion in 2023 from Rp11,004  billion in 2022 brought about by  the Tokopedia and TikTok transaction that resulted in the loss of  control of Tokopedia starting February 1, 2024.

However, our comprehensive digital ecosystem is designed to  be adaptive and flexible to endure the impacts of the historical  seasonality of our business.
The potential of Indonesia's digital economy is huge, and this is an  opportunity for GoTo.
According to a report by Google, Temasek,  and Bain & Co.
(2023), Indonesia's digital economy market is  predicted to grow fourfold and reach USD360 billion or equivalent  to Rp5,580 trillion in the next 5 to 6 years.
In the same period, the  market potential of On-Demand Services also continues to grow  and can reach USD20 billion or equivalent to Rp310 trillion.
Similarly,  the growth of digital loans, which is considered capable of reaching  USD40 billion or equivalent to Rp620 trillion in 2030, from USD6  billion or equivalent to Rp93 trillion in 2023.
These things illustrate  the huge potential for GoTo's core businesses, namely On Demand  Service and Financial Technology.
PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk  Laporan Tahunan  2023164 KILAS KINERJA PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTSLAPORAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT REPORTPROFIL PERUSAHAAN COMPANY PROFILEPENDAHULUAN PREFACE To capture such potential, the Company has prepared its strategic  roadmap for 2024, in which after achieving Adjusted EBITDA  positive in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company will continue  to focus on strengthening the company’s performance for the next  quarters.
In order to achieve that while simultaneously capturing  the aforementioned opportunities, we will operate in line with the  three pillars set out in our strategic roadmap, which are:  1.
Increase frequency and engagement of existing users, while  continuing to broaden total addressable market through  product innovation that captures budget consumers.
The Company continues to innovate and scale up products  designed for budget consumers in both of our core segments:  1.
In On-Demand Services, the Company is rolling out GoCar  Hemat and GoFood Mode Hemat - more affordable  versions of our core offerings to capture the price sensitive  consumers. 2.
GoTransit was also launched and scaled out which allows  users to book a combined motorbike and public transport  trip in one booking.
This service is intended to capture  more public transport users to our platform. 3.
Through GoTo Financial, the Company also launched GoPay  app that is aimed to capture budget consumers through its  key features such as light-sized app and transfer facility. 2.
Strengthen monetization through higher take rate products  For the Financial Technology segment, the Company has  innovated and launched several products with high take rate,  such as GoPayLater, GoPay Pinjam and GoPay Tabungan  by Jago.
For the On-Demand Services segment, we also  developed ads solutions and other value added services that  provide higher take rates.  3.
Strengthen our fundamentals through continued cost  management initiatives, which comprise of IT & infrastructure  costs, fixed operating expenses and incentives and promotion  expenses.
Furthermore, in relation to E-Commerce with the completion of  the proposed strategic partnerships, in which was announced on  January 31, 2024, where as a  part of our agreement with TikTok, we  will receive a quarterly E-commerce service fee from Tokopedia.
The e-commerce service revenue percentage is calculated  according to a sliding scale based on the core GMV of Tokopedia  during the relevant year.
Therefore, the E-commerce service fee commensurate with the  growth of the core GMV of the enlarged Tokopedia entity.
This  e-commerce service fee will be paid quarterly and contribute  immediately to Go To’s cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA.
In the beginning of 2023, we announced profitability guidance in  which we committed to reach positive contribution margin by the  first quarter of 2023, and positive adjusted EBITDA by the fourth  quarter of 2023.
In addition, the adjusted EBITDA for the year 2023  is expected to be in the range of Rp(4.5) and Rp(3.8) trillion.
This  is a revision that was announced on August 15, 2023, from the  previously expected range of Rp(5.3) and Rp(4.6) trillion, owing to  the significant progress made in the first half of the year.
GoTo delivered this commitment to target by reaching positive  contribution margin at Rp0.5 trillions in the first quarter of 2023  and positive Adjusted EBITDA for the whole of the fourth quarter  of 2023 at Rp0.1 trillion-the first time in our company’s history.
This  also exceeded the high end of our guidance range.
GoTo expects to capture additional growth in broad user  demographics in its core segments more cost-effectively  across the expansive Indonesian market by leveraging its unique  ecosystem that spans the full range of consumer spending.
The Company currently expects to achieve a full-year 2024 Group  Adjusted EBITDA breakeven.
The above outlook is based on current market conditions and  reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates, which are all subject  to various uncertainties and risks.
These include increasing market  competition, which is expected to continue over future quarters, as  well as cost inflation and other variables.
To win the  market, we make sure our brand message and value proposition  are concise, compelling and relevant to our customers.
We deliver targeted messages through various sales and marketing  activities, with the aim  to boost product awareness and brand  recognition among existing and potential customers.
On the on-demand services side, the activities include online  and offline brand advertising which encompasses digital  advertising, creative campaigns, social media marketing,  branded billboards, events and media production.
In addition, we  conduct direct marketing activities such as cashbacks, shipping  subsidies, discounts, and prizes, to increase the active users and   consideration to use among our potential audiences effectively.
As for the financial technology side, we focus on serving the  underserved and the unbanked, ultimately driving financial  inclusion in Indonesia.
One of the giveaways that was conducted to increase the active users while cementing the spirit of ‘Pasti Ada Jalan’ as Indonesian true spirit.  2023 Annual Report PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk167 TATA KELOLA PERUSAHAAN  CORPORATE GOVERNANCETANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL PERUSAHAAN  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISLAPORAN KEUANGAN    FINANCIAL STATEMENTSserta menyediakan layanan keuangan yang aman dan terpercaya  bagi pelanggan.
and reliable financial services.
With Indonesia having over 97  million unbanked adults, the GoPay app represents a significant  opportunity for us to bring financial services to more people in the  country, and enable Indonesians to manage their finances with  greater ease.
By launching the GoPay app, we aim to eliminate the barriers to  accessing financial services.
To do this, we have paid special  attention to every aspect of the app, including making it light in size  so that those for whom phone capacity is a limited resource will be  able to download it, and ensuring the app’s design is simple and  user-friendly.
To ensure GoPay app reaches its intended audience, our offline  marketing strategy prioritizes grassroots placements such as  traditional markets, local roadside stalls (warung) and others.
Similar to offline, our online marketing efforts (i.
digital ads, KOL,  social media) are strategically placed on channels where our target  audience is most concentrated.
In terms of offers, we combine direct price cuts and cashback to  ensure users get the best value for money when using the GoPay  app.
The main feature of the new app is free transfers to any bank  up to 100 times per month.
Our decision to distribute dividends follows the Company Law  and the Articles of Association, which requires our shareholders’  approval at the annual GMS upon the recommendation of the Board  of Directors.
GoTo’s distribution of dividends can be made in any  year only if GoTo records positive accumulated retained earnings.
However, the amount of dividends is determined with respect to  various factors, including, but not limited to: (i) GoTo’s retained  earnings, operating performance, cash flows, future business  prospects and financial condition; and (ii) other factors deemed  relevant by the shareholders.
Some of those factors are in fact  beyond Group’s control.
In 2023 and 2022, GoTo did not distribute  any dividend as the Group’s financial performances were beyond  requirements as stipulated in the policy above.
For e-commerce customers in particular, sales and marketing  initiatives have been conducted on a regular and seasonal basis,  such as Monthly Payday Campaigns (Waktu Indonesia Belanja/  WIB) to improve engagement and the consumer experience  during payday period.
We often combine marketing campaigns  with content from artist performances and interactive games to  introduce new products and experiences, to expand our consumer  base and to boost user funnel metrics.
Amidst the excitement of Double Date in Q4, Tokopedia made  strides to connect more deeply with female consumers.
Through  the introduction of the engaging 'War Diskon' campaign in  October, Tokopedia encouraged shoppers to seize daily deals from  various brands at 2 PM.
Supported by vehicle branding and Robotic  LED displays at Bundaran HI Jakarta, the campaign aimed to make  shopping on Tokopedia irresistible with exceptional deals for our  users and support our merchants with higher exposure.
During 12.12 alone, we recorded 72% increase in daily transacting  customers and 90% increase in sales value to our merchants, when  compared with average daily customers and sales in November.  2023 Annual Report PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk169 TATA KELOLA PERUSAHAAN  CORPORATE GOVERNANCETANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL PERUSAHAAN  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISLAPORAN KEUANGAN    FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPENGGUNAAN DANA HASIL PENAWARAN  UMUM THE USE OF PROCEEDS FROM PUBLIC OFFERING Grup GoTo berhasil mencatatkan sahamnya di BEI pada April 2022.
