After a turbulent year, the Indonesia economy continued its  upward trend in 2022, growing by 5.31% despite the many  challenges it faced.
The positive economic momentum  underlined Indonesia’s resilience amid global concern over  potentially softer growth, potential recession, and unresolved  Russia-Ukraine geopolitical tension.
Further recovery momentum in 2022 was mostly underpinned  by the surge in commodity prices and relaxation of mobility  restrictions, unleashing pent-up consumer demand.
As a net  exporter of commodities, Indonesia has enjoyed a significant  flow of commodity income as seen from the continuation of  trade surplus, which in 2022 reached a record high of US$54,5  billion.
While the increase in oil prices has led to increased fuel prices,  reigniting domestic inflationary pressure to 5.51% in 2022 (From  1.87% in 2021), household consumption has been relatively  unaffected.
This was mainly due to the pent-up demand across  all sectors after the government lifted its mobility restriction and  the positive multiplier impact of the high commodity prices.  95 Laporan Tahunan 2022 Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceAnalisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis Tanggung Jawab Sosial Lingkungan Corporate Social Responsibility 2022 Annual ReportPengaruh kebijakan global tentunya akan berdampak  signifikan terhadap arus perekonomian nasional pada tahun  2023.
Global policy influence will undoubtedly have a significant  impact on the trajectory of our economy in 2023.
We will  proceed with caution and vigilance in light of the likelihood of  a global recession and persistently high inflationary pressures,  which may force central banks in advanced countries to tighten  their monetary policies even further, which could eventually be  transmitted to our currency and/or a further rate hike by the  Central Bank of Indonesia (BI).
For Indonesia, the accommodative and prudent measures by  BI have allowed the resumption of inflow into the bond market,  providing a cushion for the Rupiah and might sustain so long as  the interest rate differential provides an attractive proposition.
The global petrochemical sector in 2022 was heavily impacted  by the surge in feedstock prices and weak product selling prices,  which were mostly a result of China's strict mobility restrictions.
The adverse impact was significant as China accounts for a  large share of the global petrochemical market.
This resulted  in lower utilization and decreased margins for petrochemical  manufacturers worldwide.
Despite the high volatility in the petrochemical sector, domestic  consumption of plastic products remained healthy, growing in  tandem with the post-pandemic economic recovery.
The resilient domestic demand growth has been primarily  driven by key structural factors such as low per capita plastic  consumption and a lack of domestic capacity, paving the way  for ample headroom for multi-year growth ahead.
Indonesia's petrochemical demand growth is expected  to outpace the rest of the world, according to Nexant, an  independent research institute.
Nexant forecasts 4.6% CAGR  growth in polyolefin consumption from 2020 to 2035, and 4%  CAGR growth in polypropylene.
Furthermore, Indonesia has the lowest per capita consumption  in the region, with 12kg/capita for polyethylene and 7kg/capita  for polypropylene, according to Nexant.
This, combined with  Indonesia's high dependency on imports, points to an attractive  opportunity for fundamental growth in the petrochemical  sector in the coming years.
In the energy sector, the government has reaffirmed its  grand plan to advance renewable energy development as a  commitment to reduce carbon emissions.
Out of the total  additional 40.6GW new capacity until 2030, slightly more than  50% consists of renewable energy with geothermal accounting  for a sizeable portion.
Indonesia has significant renewables  potential, but only a small portion has been utilized.
With potential untapped reserves considered one of the largest  in the world, Indonesia is best positioned to further expand its  geothermal capacity and remain supportive of government  transition in the power sector.  97 Laporan Tahunan 2022 Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceAnalisis & Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion & Analysis Tanggung Jawab Sosial Lingkungan Corporate Social Responsibility 2022 Annual ReportTINJAUAN KINERJA OPERASI PER SEGMEN USAHA Operational Performance Review by Business Segment The Company, through its subsidiaries, operated in  petrochemical, energy, property, hotel, tank rental, and jetty  segments.

The Company manages its petrochemical business through  its subsidiary, Chandra Asri, holding 38.55% of the ownership  interest, both directly and indirectly.
The Company’s  petrochemical segment contributed US$2,385 million to the  Company’s net revenues in 2022.
Chandra Asri manages the petrochemical production facilities  in Ciwandan, Cilegon, and Banten, mainly producing Olefin  (Ethylene, Propylene, and their byproducts, such as Py-Gas  and Mixed C4); Polyolefins (Polyethylene and Polypropylene);  Styrene Monomer, and Butadiene (and its by- products, such  as Raffinate), MTBE and Butene-1.
The strategic location of  Chandra Asri’s integrated petrochemical complex provides an  easy access to Chandra Asri’s key domestic customers, which is  directly connected to the production facility in Cilegon through  Chandra Asri’s installed pipeline.
Chandra Asri markets its products to domestic and international  customers.
This subsidiary is the sole local producer of Ethylene,  Styrene Monomer, Butadiene, MTBE, and Butene-1.
Chandra  Asri’s domestic market share (including imports) in Indonesia  is currently in the range of 50%, 30%, dan 32% for olefins,  polyethylene, dan polypropylene respectively.
In 2022, Chandra Asri’s operating rate declined to 77% which  was primarily driven by the external supply-demand disruption.
The Polyethylene plant achieved an operating rate of 80%,  followed by 90% at the Polypropylene plant, 64% at the Styrene  Monomer plant, and 62% at the Butadiene plant.
Meanwhile, the MTBE plant achieved an operating rate of  24% mainly due to the obligation to fulfill the off-take raffinate  agreement which was considered in the Final Investment  Decision of the project, and Butene-1 recorded an operating  rate of 60% throughout 2022.
In terms of volume, the Company’s product sales in 2022  reached 1,909 KT, decreased from 2021 which was 3,192 KT.
The  decrease was mainly due to volatile market situation.
However,  the demand level of petrochemical products in Indonesia  remains healthy and reflects resilience recovery of domestic  consumption past strict mobility.
Chandra Asri is holding a  strategic position as it is able to retain demands from the  customers with premium price based on high added-value and  security of supplies.

Despite all the key dynamic factors affecting the global  petrochemical industry, Chandra Asri's healthy operational level  points to a strong local demand for petrochemical products.
As a leading petrochemical producer, it is imperative for the  Company to maintain strong liquidity, providing a cushion  against volatile times and readiness to pivot to full-throttle  recovery mode should the global recovery materializes.
Longer term, Chandra Asri is best positioned to benefit from  the promising domestic demand outlook for petrochemical  products, which will support the company's grand plan to  expand capacity by developing the second petrochemical  complex.
In the energy pillar, the Company's exposure to both coal-fired  power plants and geothermal will place it in an advantageous  position to support the government's power sector transitioning  program.
The year also served as positive testament of our decision to  diversify into a more stable energy pillar, thereby mitigating  the effects of a challenging environment in the petrochemical  division.
Our softer performance in 2022 was predominantly the result  of rising oil price and weak petrochemical product prices on  China’s strict covid policy.
Nevertheless, our energy segment  continued to provide the necessary cushion to withstand the  impact of volatile petrochemical segment, which translated to  positive consolidated EBITDA of US$475m in 2022.
During this challenging time, it is crucial for the Company to  maintain a prudent financial policy, as evidenced by our strong  liquidity pool and healthy leverage matrix.
Company remains committed to carrying out its expansion  strategy through group restructuring and consolidation of its  geothermal assets in order to strengthen our position in the  renewable energy sector.
These strategies are anticipated  to strengthen the Company’s position as a diversified and  integrated energy company and enable the Company to  support energy transition program.
This is accomplished through our subsidiary Barito Renewables  Energy (BREN), which will enable us to expand our renewable  energy portfolio scope and funding sources.
Through BREN, we  have further added our ownership on our geothermal assets  to strengthen our domestic position and advance to the next  growth milestone. 114 Laporan Tahunan 2022 2022 Annual Report Kilas Kinerja 2022 2022 Performance Highlights Laporan Manajemen Management Report Profil Perusahaan Company Profile Sumber Daya Manusia Human ResourcesPROYEKSI TAHUN 2023 2023 Projection Ketangguhan ekonomi Indonesia diharapkan dapat terus  bertahan dengan baik di tahun 2023, dengan beberapa  catatan.
Indonesia's resilience is expected to endure well in 2023, but  with some notes.
The probable shift in global macroeconomic  policy could cause unrest and should not be underrated.
