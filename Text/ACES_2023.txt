GLOBAL ECONOMIC  REVIEW According to IMF data, the  global economy has been slowly  recovering from the impact of  the pandemic, Russia’s invasion  of Ukraine, and the cost of living  crisis.
However, growth remained  slow and uneven, leading to  increasing global inequality.
The  global growth rate decreased from  3.5% in 2022 to 3,0% in 2023, and  was predicted to fall further to  2.9% in 2024.
In 2023, the SSSG target was 6.5%, while the  Company succeeded in achieving the target  with SSSG realization of 8.1%.
Furthermore,  the sales growth target was at 8-10%, while  the Company managed to achieve growth of  12%.
The global activity reached its lowest point at the end of  the last year, while inflation gradually came under control.
General inflation continued to slow down, from 9.2% in  2022, to 5.9%.
in 2023, and was forecasted to 4.8% in 2024.
However, achieving full recovery to pre-pandemic trends will  be increasingly difficult, especially in emerging markets and  developing countries.
According to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the Indonesian  economy grew by 5.05% in 2023, lower than the achievement in  2022 that experienced a growth of 5.31%.
The Transportation  and Warehousing Business Field experienced the highest  growth in production at 13.96%, while in terms of expenditure,  the Consumption Expenditure of Non-Profit Institutions  Serving Households (PK-LNPRT) achieved the highest growth  at 9.83%.
The economy of Indonesia in 2023 is measured  based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices,  reaching IDR 20,892.4 trillion, and GDP per capita reaching  IDR 75.0 million or USD 4,919.7.
Additionally, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Finance  (Kemenkeu), the national economy cumulatively grew by  5.05% until the third quarter of 2023.
This consistent growth  demonstrates the resilience and better performance of the  Indonesian economy compared to many other countries.
Inflation in Indonesia was also under control, standing at  2.61% (yoy) as of December 2023 which is much lower than  the projected rate of 3.6%.
The volatile food inflation, which is  the primary contributor to inflation, such as rice, chilies, and  garlic, also started to show a downward trend in December  2023.
Despite the global environmental disruption throughout 2023,  including supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, financial  sector volatility, and geo-economic fragmentation, the  Indonesian economy has remained relatively resilient.
This  resilience is reflected in the growth in domestic demand and  supply, which remained strong until the third quarter of 2023.
Household consumption grew by 4.9% (ytd), investment grew  by 4.2% (ytd), while exports grew by 1.1% (ytd), and imports  weakened by 2.0% (ytd) due to the impact of the weakening  global economy.
In terms of production, the transportation, food and drink  accommodation, and communications information sectors  also showed positive growth.
Despite the global commodity  prices moderating, the mining sector was able to grow by  5.7%.
Additionally, Indonesia’s trade balance maintained  positive performance, with a surplus recorded for 43  consecutive months, reaching 33.63 billion US dollars from  January to November 2023.
However, due to the weakening  global economy, particularly in Indonesia’s main trading  partner countries, exports and imports have been in the  negative zone since early 2023.
On the external side, there has been a decline in the real growth  of goods exports due to weakening demand from major trading  partner countries, especially China, and falling commodity  prices.
However, service exports have grown strongly, in line  with the increase in the number of foreign tourists.
The SBN market witnessed an inflow of up to Rp8.75 trillion  by December 2023, leading to a downward trend in yields over  the last two months.
On December 13, 2023, the 10-year SBN  yield fell to 6.74%, and the weighted average 10-year SBN yield  was 6.68% (ytd), nearly 100 basis points lower than the 2023  State-Budget assumption of 7.9%.
This success was achieved  during a time when the Federal Reserve increased interest  rates in the United States by 500 basis points above 5%.
Moreover, the domestic economy displayed resilience, as  evidenced by various indicators.
Production activity remained  strong, as confirmed by the Indonesian Manufacturing PMI,  which remained expansive at 52.2.
Electricity consumption  grew at a high rate of 14% for businesses and 6.7% for industries.
From the consumption side, the Consumer Confidence Index  maintained a high level, reaching 123.6.
Meanwhile, the Real  Sales Index remained positive, reaching 2.9% According to Bank Indonesia (BI), the Rupiah exchange rate  will remain stable with the stabilization policy pursued by  Bank Indonesia, amidst the strong US dollar, which exerts  pressure on the currencies of other countries.
The strength  of the US dollar is due to high interest rates and large capital  flows into the US, putting pressure on the exchange rates of  various countries worldwide.
The US dollar exchange rate  index against major currencies (DXY) was recorded at 106.7 at  the end of October 2023 and remained at the level of 101.3 on  December 29, 2023.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK The World Bank has predicted that the global economy will  grow by 3% in 2024, with momentum for economic recovery  continuing despite high levels of financial market uncertainty.
The economy of the United States is expected to remain  strong, supported by domestic demand, while India’s growth  is also predicted to improve thanks to government and private  investment.
China’s economic outlook remains weak, but  slightly better than previous projections due to increased  fiscal stimulus.
Commodity prices are expected to rise due to increased  transportation costs driven by geopolitical tensions and tight  supply due to weather factors.
This is expected to halt the  rate of decline in global inflation, with inflation in developed  countries expected to be above the Fed Funds Rate (FFR)  interest rate target, which is expected to decline in the  second half of 2024.
Despite these projections, global financial market uncertainty  remains high, as evidenced by increasing US Treasury yields  in line with long-term risk premiums and inflation that is  still above market forecasts.
This has resulted in continued  strengthening of the US dollar globally, and limited foreign  capital inflows, putting increasing pressure on weakening  exchange rates in emerging market countries.
It is therefore  important to strengthen policy responses to mitigate the  negative impact of global spillovers, including in Indonesia.
On the other hand, Indonesia’s economy remains strong,  driven by good domestic demand in household consumption  and investment sectors.
Building investment has exceeded  expectations and has been supported by National Strategic  Projects (PSN) in various areas.
Private property development,  as a result of government incentives, has also had a positive  impact.
Perlengkapan Rumah Tangga • Peralatan • HORECABA (Hotel, Restaurant, Cafe, Bakery equipment )  • Alat Kebersihan • Alat Berkebun • Alat ListrikFurthermore, household consumption and non-building  investment are expected to remain stable, although they  need to be encouraged.
This will help maintain good domestic  demand, which is evident in several indicators such as  the Consumer Confidence Index, Real Sales Index, and  Manufacturing PMI, all of which are currently in the optimistic  zone.
Bank Indonesia’s stabilization policy is expected to keep the  Rupiah exchange rate under control, and inflation will stay  within the target range of 2.5 ± 1%.
A stable economic and  political situation is likely to provide good business prospects,  making the Company optimistic about business growth in  2024.
The Company will continue to monitor macroeconomic  conditions and the uncertain global geopolitical situation.
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE 2023 TARGET AND  REALIZATION, AND THE 2024 PROJECTION Achievements in 2023 exceeded the targets set by the  Company.
