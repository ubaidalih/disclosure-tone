According to  Inaplas, the petrochemical market growth in 2020 was  estimated at -2.5%.
In the Renewable Energy sector, the Ministry of Energy  and Mineral Resources (ESDM) revealed that investment  realization in the Renewable Energy sub-sector reached  US$1.36 billion by the end of 2020, less than the 2020  investment target of US$2.02 billion.
The renewable  energy and energy conservation sector achieved the  target of US$540 million, and the geothermal sector  achieved a total of US$702 million from the target of  US$1,050 million.
The Ministry of Industry published a forecast that the  petrochemical industry production process can be  carried out on the basis of renewable energy by 2030.
