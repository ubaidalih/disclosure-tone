GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH  DECELERATED DUE TO WAR Global economy in 2022 was still in uncertainty.
While  the world was trying to recover from the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic with the emergence of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the potential for a crisis loomed again because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February 24, 2022  subjected Russia to various kinds of economic and non-economic sanctions by Western countries.
These sanctions directly affected commodity, energy and food prices since Russia and Ukraine play important roles in the global food and energy supply chain.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict had an impact on the disruption of commodity, food and energy supply chains, pushed the global inflation rate to the highest level, and in the end triggered a new economic crisis.

Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat, pig iron, enriched uranium, natural gas, palladium, and nickel.
Russia along with its ally Belarus which was also sanctioned by European Union (EU), are also important suppliers of fertilizers, including nitrogen and potash.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, pig iron, maize and barley and is the world’s largest exporter of sunflower seed oil.
Ukraine is also the largest exporter of neon gas, which is an essential component for manufacturing electronic chips.
Many countries relied on energy and commodity  supplies from Russia and Ukraine.
Europe imported substantial amounts of energy from Russia, including natural gas (35%), crude oil (20%) and coal (40%).
Russia was also dependent on the EU market as around 40% of its crude oil and natural gas production went to the EU.
In addition, many developing countries were highly dependent on food supplies from Russia and Ukraine.
More than half of wheat imports to African, European and Middle Eastern countries came from Russia and Ukraine.

Prior to the Russian invasion, the price of crude oil had risen throughout 2021 due to fundamental factors, namely a surge in demand that was not matched by increased production and limited supply.
The recovery of economic activity in a number of countries at end of 2021, especially China, increased the need for crude oil.
As soon as Russia attacked Ukraine, world oil prices shot up to US$116 per barrel in March 2022 and reached a peak of US$120 per barrel in June 2022 (Brent).
Sanctions imposed by the Western followed by  cuts in gas supply to the European Union by Russia caused natural gas prices to increase by around 10%.
Gas shortage in Europe immediately pushed up coal prices significantly since several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Italy, were forced to restart their coal-fired power plants.
Coal prices continued to soar to more than 100% from US$223 per ton (Newcastle) in January 2022 and reached a record US$458 per ton on September 5, 2022.
THE WORLD ON THE VERGE OF  RECESSION Russia-Ukraine conflict and Western sanctions against  Russia created a new economic crisis.
Supply chain disruptions that caused food and energy commodity prices to rise ultimately pushed global inflation to high levels.
High inflation was recorded in a number of countries, such as Argentina (94.8%), Turkey (64.3%), Russia (11.9%), Italy (11.6%), Britain (10.7%) and the European Union (9.2%).
On average, the global inflation rate in 2022 reached 8.8%, much higher than 4.7% in 2021, and the highest since the world financial sector crisis in 2008.

Meanwhile, China, as one of the pillars of the world economy, still limited its economic activities with its Zero-Covid policy to reduce the spike in cases and faced a crisis in the property sector which decelerated its economic performance.
High inflation due to commodity prices, rising interest  rates and financial market volatility caused world economic growth to slow down significantly.
The simultaneous economic slowdown in the US, EU and China weakened economic activities in almost all countries.
Germany, Britain and other European countries which have close economic relations, with both Russia and Ukraine, were already on the verge of recession.
Russia, Hong Kong, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and Macau even slipped into recession since the third quarter of 2022 as marked by negative growth over the previous two quarters.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its October  2022 World Economic Report projected global growth in 2022 of only 3.2%, down from the initial projection of 4.4%.
Meanwhile, the World Bank in its January 2023 World Bank Global Economic Prospects report cut its global economic growth projection from 4.1% to 2.9%.

Domestically, Indonesia was still facing the COVID-19 pandemic with the emergence of rampant cases of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the beginning of the year.
However, Indonesia was far better prepared in handling the Omicron variant than the Delta variant.
The characteristic of Omicron is that it has milder symptoms so it doesn’t cause overcrowding in health facilities.
Community mobility is not too disturbed either.
Most people were more confident about doing activities because they have received the vaccine up to the third dose.
Change in the geopolitical order because of the Russia- Ukraine conflict was certainly a major challenge for the national economic recovery.
Rising prices for food, industrial raw materials and energy as a result of supply chain disruptions and a potential spike in global inflation put pressure on the domestic food, energy and financial sectors.
On the other hand, the global situation also had  positive implications.
The increase in energy and commodity prices provided a windfall profit in sectors related to export commodities.
Coal, bauxite, tin, palm oil and nickel were the five leading export commodities whose prices have risen so high that they have been able to strengthen Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves amid the threat of high inflation.
The increase in world crude oil prices and the ICP  (Indonesian Crude Price) forced the government to adjust the price of fuel oil (BBM) on September 3, 2022.
The government raised fuel prices because the burden of fuel subsidies was increasing and the facts showed that most targets of the fuel subsidies were inappropriate.
The reduction in fuel subsidies provides fiscal space for the government to divert some of the subsidies to more targeted aids, thereby easing the burden on the society amid rising fuel prices, non-subsidized LPG, food and transportation costs.

Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), Indonesia’s annual inflation rate in 2022 reached 5.51%, higher than the government’s target of 3.0% and much higher than inflation in 2021 of 1.87% and 2020 of 1.68%.
However, Indonesia’s inflation rate was lower than many other countries, such as Argentina (94.8%), Turkey (64.3%), UK (11.1%), US (6.5%), Singapore (6.7%) %) and India (5.7%).
Entering 2022, Indonesia’s economic recovery  continued amidst uncertainty and escalation of the various impacts of the perfect storm on the global economy.
Economic growth in the first quarter of 2022 remained strong at 5.01%, slightly decreased from the fourth quarter of 2021 of 5.02%.
This positive performance was driven by increased domestic demand in line with increased mobility of people and maintained export performance.
Improvements in the national economy occurred in many business sectors in all regions.

Even the real gross domestic product (GDP), which implies overall economic growth rate or for each sector, was much higher than before the pandemic.
Consumption and export spending were the main pillars of economic growth.
The government’s policy of allowing Eid al-Fitr homecoming, after prohibited in the last two years due to the pandemic, stimulated public consumption very strongly and generated economic turnover in all regions of Indonesia.
Export performance also contributed significantly to growth supported by rising commodity prices and strengthening output capacity in the manufacturing sector.
The consumer confidence index was good and retail  sales continued to grow.
The prospect of increasing demand was an incentive for the industry to increase production.
Indonesia’s external sector indicators were relatively good and under control, reflected in the trade balance with a surplus for 26 consecutive months, high foreign exchange reserves and debt ratio at a safe level.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its “Asian  Development Outlook” report on July 21, 2022 projected Indonesia’s economic growth in 2022 to reach 5.2%.
This projection referred to positive growth in the 2 quarters supported by increased economic activity, stable export growth and a more controlled number of COVID-19 cases.
ADB’s forecast was the same as the 2022 State Budget (APBN) projection which assumes Indonesia’s 2022 economic growth will be 5.2%.
Meanwhile, the IMF’s projection was 5.4% and the World Bank’s was 5.1%.
In the third quarter of 2022, Indonesia’s economic  performance continued to strengthen, reaching 5.72%.
The increase in exports continued with growth reaching 21.64%, supported by demand from major trading partners which remained strong and policies to accelerate exports of palm oil.
Imports also grew in line with domestic and export demands which remained high.

The growth in manufacturing sector was maintained as can be seen from Indonesia’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) which was recorded at 50.9 points in December 2022.
This figure is in fact down compared to December 2021 which was 53.5 points.
Nonetheless, a PMI score above 50 points indicates that Indonesia’s manufacturing sector was still in an expansive condition.
Only three ASEAN countries recorded manufacturing  PMI growth, namely the Philippines (53.1), Thailand (52.5) and Indonesia (50.9).
The Philippines manufacturing led growth in the ASEAN region for the first time in 34 months.
Meanwhile, other ASEAN countries were already at the level of contraction.
Malaysia’s manufacturing sector worsened during December at 47.8 points.
PMI Vietnam only reached 46.4 points, indicating weakening conditions for two consecutive months in November and December.
The sharpest decline was seen in Myanmar (42.1).
The rating agency Standard and Poor's (S&P) regularly conducts a PMI Manufacturing Indonesia survey to measure  the performance of the manufacturing sector.
The Manufacturing PMI is based on five individual indices: new orders, output, employment, supplier delivery time and stock purchased, with the delivery time index is reversed so it moves in a comparable direction.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector compared to the previous month, below 50 indicates contractions, while 50 indicates no change.
Indonesia's Manufacturing PMI closed at 50.9 points in December 2022, up from 50.3 points in November.
Output and  new orders increased at a stronger pace, amid increased buying and employment activity.
However, foreign demand continues to shrink, indicating worsening global economic conditions.
Supply constraints remained, as waiting times were extended again due to bad weather.
On the price front, input cost inflation fell below the average although it remains market with high raw material, fuel and currency conversion costs supporting the cost hikes.

WORLD’S COAL CONSUMPTION  INCREASED Coal prices continued to increase throughout 2022.
Since the beginning of the year, coal prices had fluctuated but the trend strengthened, continuing the positive trend since 2021.
In January 2022, the Newcastle coal price was at the level of US$223 per ton and in December 2022 it was at the level US$402 per ton.
This implied an increase of 81% since January 2022 and 367% compared to the price in January 2021 of US$86 per ton.
The sharpest price increase occurred a few days after  Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
At that time, coal prices were still at the level of US$239 per ton, then jumped to US$440 per ton on March 2, 2022.
The price was corrected again by US$253 per ton on March 29, 2022.
After that, coal prices rose again to reach a highest level of US$458 per ton on September 5, 2022.
The increase in energy and commodity prices provided a windfall profit in sectors related to export commodities such as coal, bauxite, tin, palm oil, and nickel.

According to the Indonesian Coal Mining Association (APBI) report, increased demand occurred from traditional and non-traditional markets amidst high geopolitical tensions until the end of 2022.
Traditional buyers with large consumption portions such as India and China bought coal at a higher percentage than before.
China’s need for coal imports was projected to reach  240 million tons in 2022.
Meanwhile, India, which absorbs low calorie coal, imported around 140 million tons.
Demand from non-traditional buyers in Europe also showed a significant increase.
From January to November 2022, coal exports to Europe were recorded at 5.9 million tons.
Of this amount, Poland absorbed 2.1 million tons, followed by the Netherlands and Italy with 1.3 million tons and 1.2 million tons, respectively.
Previously, exports to Europe never exceeded 1 million tons.
Referring to Minerba One Data Indonesia (MODI) data  from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), the realization of Indonesian coal production in 2022 was 685 million tons or 103% of the target of 663 million tons and an increase of 12% of actual production in 2021.
Meanwhile, actual export sales amounted to 313 million tons or 63% of the target of 497 million tons.
In addition, actual DMO (Domestic Market Obligation) absorbed 129 million tons of the total domestic demand of 231 million tons.
DEMAND FOR HEAVY EQUIPMENT  SHARPLY INCREASED  The year 2022 was a golden year of the heavy  equipment business in Indonesia because of the very high demand.
The Indonesian Heavy Equipment Sole Agent Association (PAABI) predicted that by the end of the year heavy equipment sales growth would reach an all-time high at more than 20 thousand units.
In the first half of 2022, sales of heavy equipment reached around 12,000 units, not including mini excavators.
This figure was up around 63% from the same period in 2021 of 7,374 units.

The increase in coal and mineral commodity prices stimulated demand growth in mining sector.
This composition slightly changed from the previous year.
In 2021, the main contributor to heavy equipment growth was construction sector at 40%, while mining sector contributed 34%, forestry sector at 17% and plantation sector at 9%.
Gold Remained Prospective The year 2022 was a good momentum for gold commodity.
Starting at US$1,816 per troy ounce in January 2022, gold prices continued to show an upward trend.
The peak occurred in March 2022 where the gold price touched US$1,948 per troy ounce after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict made commodity prices soar and prompted investors to switch to gold investment to secure their investment assets.
Furthermore, prices gradually fell back in response to  the aggressive increase in benchmark interest rates by the US central bank, The Fed, and the appreciation of the US dollar which outweighed market concerns about rising inflation and geopolitical risks.
The Fed raised interest rates five times in 2022 which triggered the US dollar index to rise 16% to its highest level in 20 years.
Meanwhile, yields on the 10-year Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS) reached their highest level since February 2011, increasing the opportunity cost of investing in zero-yield assets including gold.
As a result, holdings of gold exchange-traded funds fell for the fifth straight month.
In October 2022, gold prices touched its lowest point in 30 months of US$1,664 per troy ounce, although it immediately rebounded in the last two months of 2022.
Closing the year 2022, gold prices were getting  higher as a result of weakening yields on 10-year US government bonds after reaching peak levels for six weeks.
Market expectations that The Fed would slow down the increase in benchmark interest rates and easing China’s Zero-COVID policy as well as fears of a global recession provided positive sentiment that supported the recovery of the gold price to near US$1,800 per troy ounce by the end of 2022.

A number of central banks also continued to increase gold reserves.
Construction Industry Still Slowing  Down After going through a two-year pandemic, construction  business players hoped that 2022 would become a momentum for increased opportunities for the construction market.
The construction value for building projects was predicted to reach Rp157 trillion in 2022, driven by growth in the housing and industrial sectors.
Other sectors, such as hotels, retail and offices, started to show positive growth since the second half of 2021.
This fostered optimism in the construction market.

At end of 2022, the national construction value reached  Rp315 trillion.
This value exceeded the construction value in 2019 or before the pandemic of Rp279 trillion.
However, the development of the construction industry market was not very good.
The construction industry must face tough challenges as a result of low global economic growth.
Rising prices for raw materials and fuel, high inflation, rising interest rates and slowing economic growth, which stifled real income and purchasing power, slowed down construction activities.
This prompted a number of construction projects and property developers to reschedule their projects.
According to BPS report, the construction business  contracted in the first quarter of 2022 by -1.24% and was further pressured in the second quarter of 2022 by -6.05%.
The contraction was mainly due to the decline in the realization of cement procurement.
The construction business was able to record positive growth in the third quarter of 2022 of 4.72% due to an increase in infrastructure activities supported by an increase in imports of construction raw materials, such as cement and glass.
In addition, the physical realization of construction activities was also better than the previous quarter in line with the increase in the construction cost index.

One of the steps taken by the government is to establish a green economy as the main strategy for medium- and long-term economic transformation.
Indonesia’s commitment is shown by giving full attention to the development of new and renewable energy.
In the 2021-2030 Electric Power Supply Business Plan  (RUPTL) issued by the Ministry of ESDM, until 2030, the government projects an additional power plant capacity of 40,600 megawatts (MW).
Of the total additions, 20,900 MW or 51.6% are new and renewable energy power plants.
The remaining 19,700 MW or 48.4% is for coal, gas and fuel oil (BBM) power plants.
The 2021-2030 RUPTL is one of the concrete evidences of the government’s commitment in the transition to green ene’gy where the portion for developing new and renewable energy is larger than fossil energy.
Of the new and renewable energy mix, hydroelectric  power plant (PLTA) has the largest portion of 10,391 MW, followed by solar power plants (PLTS) of 4,680 MW, geothermal power plants (PLTP) of 3,355 MW and the rest were other new and renewable energy plants.
PLTA is a priority because it has a low cost of electricity supply (BPP) and has abundant potential, which is around 75,000 MW.
Until now, only about 6,100 MW has been utilized.

On the other hand, the government determines that  starting in 2030 the addition of power plants will only come from new and renewable energy.
The goal is to gradually reduce the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants until they are finally stopped.
This means that starting in 2030 there will be no more construction of coal-based power plants.
The development of new and renewable energy in the future will mainly be focused on PLTS.

However, a number of observers consider that the  growth rate of new and renewable energy capacity is still slow.
new and renewable energy development in Indonesia is not yet on track with a target of 23% of the new and renewable energy mix in 2025 as stipulated in the National Energy Policy/Government Regulation No. 79 of 2014.
To achieve the target, new and renewable energy generating capacity must reach a minimum of 24,000 MW or around 2-3 GW additional capacity every year.
Quoting the Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook  (IETO) 2023 report released by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), the transition readiness framework shows that Indonesia’s readiness for the energy transition is still low.
The portion of new and renewable energy in Indonesia’s primary energy mix in 2022 actually decreased from 11.5% in 2021 to 10.4% because the portion of coal increased to 43%.
The target of 23% new and renewable energy by 2025 will be difficult to achieve if the government does not strengthen political commitment to new and renewable energy development.

However, there are still different perceptions and priorities of the policy makers regarding how the energy transition process is carried out.
Investment climate also needs to be improved by  increasing financial support for new and renewable energy developers, procurement process, tariff schemes, as well as shorter and clearer licensing process.
At end of the third quarter of 2022, the realization of investment in new and renewable energy only reached US$1.35 billion, or 35% of the government’s 2022 target of US$3.97 billion.
In addition, the development of new and renewable energy will depend heavily on PLN’s readiness as an off taker to purchase electricity from new and renewable energy power plants.

Aksi korporasi ini dilakukan melalui anak usaha PT Energia The surge in commodity prices in the global market which was beyond expectations, led to significant growth in all of the Company’s commodity-based business lines.
Construction Machinery, Mining Contracting and Coal Mining segments were able to provide relatively more balanced revenue contributions.
However, despite the current favorable condition, the  Company believes that the commodity booming will come to an end.
Unpredictable coal price volatility will pose a high risk to the Company’s business continuity.
Therefore, the Company consistently transitions and transforms its business into mineral and new and renewable energy sectors with the aim of rebalancing the portfolio, reducing dependence on coal-related businesses and having a more sustainable business portfolio.
The Company continued its strategic plan in developing  the energy segment, particularly the development of new and renewable energy.

PERFORMANCE IN 2022 Coal is one of the best performed commodities throughout 2022.
The increased demand for coal in the global market prompted the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to raise its 2022 coal production target to 663 million tons, up 6% from the 2021 target of 625 million tons.
On the other hand, PAMA faced challenges in meeting  the need for heavy equipment, including subcontractor equipment, to adjust to increased production.
To overcome this, PAMA intensively coordinated with UT as the heavy equipment supplier, and increased remanufacture capacity.
The growth in utilization of production equipment  had an impact on the increasing need for operators and supporting workers.
Therefore, PAMA carried out a massive recruitment program including incorporation of Special Labor Exchange Center (BKK Center) as a source for recruiting local workers.
PAMA recorded consolidated revenue of Rp47.4 trillion,  an increase of 43% from Rp33.2 trillion in 2021.
The volume of overburden removal increased by 12% from 852 million bank cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 954 million bcm, and coal production was 116 million tons, relatively the same as in 2021.

Gold Mining segment is managed by PT Agincourt Resources (PTAR), a gold mineral exploration, mining and processing company that operates Martabe Gold Mine in North Sumatra.
The Company holds 95% ownership of PTAR through PT Danusa Tambang Nusantara (DTN).
Based on JORC data as of June 2022,  PTAR had gold and silver resources of 6.5 million ounces and 64 million ounces, respectively, with total gold and silver ore reserves of 3.9 million ounces and 36 million ounces, respectively.
Global gold prices indicated an  upward trend in the first quarter of 2022.
Russian invasion of Ukraine made gold prices soar as investors turned to investing in gold to secure their investment assets.
Subsequently, prices gradually fell back in response to yields from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and the high appreciation of the US dollar.
Meanwhile, the increase in global  oil prices which had an impact on fuel prices significantly influenced the increase in PTAR’s operational cost components.

After going through the pandemic for two years, the infrastructure and property sectors have started to show positive growth since the second half of 2021.
Infrastructure is still the backbone and one of  the main drivers of the construction market.
The government encourages private sector to take part in the development, financing and management of large infrastructure projects.
However, construction industry still had to face tough  challenges in 2022.
Global dynamics had impacts on rising oil and raw material prices, high inflation and interest rates, as well as decelerating domestic economic growth that resulted in slowing down construction activities.
This prompted a number of construction projects, including property developers, to reschedule their projects.
ACSET recorded net revenues of Rp949.1 billion, a  decrease of 35% compared to 2021 of Rp1.5 trillion.
The decrease in revenue was due to the increasingly limited number of carry over contracts and several delays in determination of new contracts.
ACSET recorded a net loss of Rp448.9 billion mainly  due to a slowdown in several ongoing projects.
However, the net loss improved compared to 2021 of Rp695.5 billion.
In terms of contribution by business line, revenue  generation in 2022 mainly came from the infrastructure sector of 33%, the structure sector of 42% and the foundation sector of 25%.
New Projects In 2022, ACSET obtained 22 new projects with a total value of Rp2.1 trillion.
ACSET strives to complete projects well, maintain safety elements and prioritize the best quality.

A number of studies, reviews and realization of  projects in this segment have been performed.
First, development of Solar Photovoltaic (Solar PV) technology as a solar power plant (PLTS).
The Company also conducted studies on development of several hydroelectric power plant (PLTA) projects with reputable and experienced business partners.
The targeted potential projects are in Sumatra and Sulawesi, which have abundant potential, estimated at over 10MW.
In addition, the Company is also actively conducting  studies, reviews and exploring strategic partnerships to develop other types of new and renewable energy, such as floating solar PV, wind power plants (PLTB), hybrid solar PV and battery storage, as well as waste to energy.
In 2022, the development of new and renewable  energy progressed significantly.
Throughout 2022, EPN had secured a commitment to install rooftop solar PV of 15.77 MWp.
From the contract, the installation of rooftop Solar PV with a total of 3.7 MWp was carried out at several UT and Astra Group facilities.
The delays experienced by this project were caused by the lengthy installation permit process and the limitation of the installation of solar power plants from the total installed electric power capacity.
Total rooftop Solar PV that has been installed is 6.2 MWp and will continue to increase in the coming years.
Not only solar energy, EPN has also developed hydro  energy potential.
Currently, EPN is developing Besai Kemu Mini Hydro Power Plant (PLTM), in Bukit Kemuning, Lampung Province.
At end of 2022, the project progress reached 87% and is expected to start commercial operations in 2023.

Arkora is a company that focuses on developing new and renewable energy.
Arkora has 2 (two) operational PLTM units, namely  PLTM Cikopo 2 with a capacity of 7.4 MW in West Java and PLTM Tomasa with a capacity of 10 MW in Central Sulawesi.
In addition, Arkora has 2 (two) PLTM projects that are still under construction, which are expected to operate in 2023 and 2025.
After these two PLTM projects are operational, Arkora will have new and renewable energy power plants with a total installed capacity of 32.8 MW.
Going forward, Arkora has a number of project pipelines that are ready to be developed.
This indirectly adds to the new and renewable energy portfolio for the EPN Group.
OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN  DEVELOPING NEW AND RENEWABLE ENERGY In National Energy Policy/Government Regulation No.  79 of 2014, the government set a target of 23% share of new and renewable energy in the energy mix by 2025.
In line with this target, the government issued a  number of regulations that provide opportunities for the private sector to develop new and renewable energy.
Therefore, the Company is determined that energy business pillar is focused on developing new and renewable energy which must continue to grow and be sustainable in order to support other business pillars.

This makes potential investors or funding institutions still hesitant to invest.
Meanwhile, new and renewable energy development requires a fairly large investment because the technology is quite expensive.
In addition, in development of on-grid (connected  to PLN network) PLTS, since the beginning of 2022, PLN has imposed capacity restrictions which have an immediate impact on slowing down the growth of PLTS in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, the use of independent PLTS installed outside PLN electricity permit area has grown faster.
Installing solar panels with batteries has replaced many diesel generators in coal mining areas, so that they can cut operational costs while reducing carbon emissions.

World Bank in its January 2023 World Bank Global Economic Prospects report projected that global growth will slow to 1.7% in 2023.
This growth rate will be the weakest in nearly three decades, after the threat of a global recession caused by the pandemic in 2020 and global financial crisis in 2009.
This forecast largely reflects concerns over more aggressive monetary tightening policies, deteriorating global financial market conditions and declining investor confidence.
On the other hand, China’s economy will soon improve  in 2023 as a result of Zero-COVID policy elimination and Chinese Government’s efforts to save property sector which was almost collapsing.
China’s recovery will push the Asian region’s economies and commodity-exporting countries to become more stable, considering that China is a dominant commodity importer.
The demand for portfolio rebalancing will increase considering the Company’s high dependence on the coal business.
Therefore, the Company has decided to enter the new and renewable energy and other minerals business portfolios as future investment for a more sustainable business.

Geopolitical tensions will continue to be the biggest risk to the global economy.
While the Russia-Ukraine war shows no sign of ending, US and Chinese friction over Taiwan and rising tension on Korean peninsula are likely to keep investors on guard.
Solutions to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remain elusive.
This means that there is no solution to the lingering effects of this conflict on the global supply of energy and food commodities.
COAL INDUSTRY PROJECTION International Energy Agency (IEA) in its annual report in December 2022 estimated that global coal consumption will remain at the same level in the next few years if there are no stronger efforts by the people around the world to shift to a low-carbon economy.
High gas prices and disruption to the world’s energy supply in 2022 will cause a number of countries to switch to coal, which is relatively cheaper.

As a result, global coal use will increase by 1.2%, or reach more than 8 billion tons per year for the first time.
The largest increase in coal demand is expected to occur in India at 7%, followed by the European Union at 6% and China at 0.4%.
European coal demand will increase due to more shift from gas to coal due to high gas prices and limited Russian gas supply.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources set a  coal production target for 2023 of 694 million tons, up 5% from 2022 target and 1% from actual production in 2022.
Coal demand from China and India is expected to increase because China has already relaxed its Zero-Covid policy so that their economic growth will be faster, while India is also increasing their electricity capacity in 2023.
Apart from anticipating export demand, domestic demand is also expected to increase.
GOLD INDUSTRY PROJECTION The prospect for gold prices is expected to be bright again in 2023 after the price continued to rise consistently from its lowest point of US$1,664 per troy ounce in October 2022.
Gold prices is predicted to increase, but its movement will fluctuate due to various sentiments, such as inflation, reference interest rates policy and financial market response to the threat of a global recession.
Observers predicted that there will be a shift in  investment instruments globally.
Since the pandemic, global market’s safe haven investment trend has continued to change.
In 2020 and 2021, the market believes crypto assets would become the new safe haven.
But in the end many crypto assets fell so that in 2022 the market shifted its assets to US dollars which caused the US currency to become very strong and put pressure on the currencies of many other countries.
Along with the development of global conditions, it is  estimated that investors will shift their assets to gold as the most desirable instrument.

Market demand for gold is driven by high  global inflation accompanied by reduced employment opportunities.
Stagflation will spur investors to buy gold in large quantities.
In addition, the policy adopted by several countries, including Indonesia, to issue bullion banks also contributes to gold booming.
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PROJECTION National construction industry is still facing tough challenges as a result of global economic slowdown.
High inflation rates, rising interest rates and raw materials are expected to restrain construction activities.
Nonetheless, Indonesia’s good economic growth in 2022 raises hopes that the national construction market in 2023 will experience growth, although not too large.
The worth of national construction which includes  building and civil sectors is estimated to reach Rp333.0 trillion in 2023, an increase of 5.8% from 2022 of Rp314.8 trillion with a composition of 52.7% in building sector and 47.3% in civil sector.
Building sector is estimated to reach a value of Rp175.5 trillion with residential and industrial projects as the largest contributors to total building construction value of 31.28% and 25.02%, respectively.
Meanwhile, commercial projects (retail and offices) are believed to grow in 2023.
Residential projects such as landed houses will grow  dominantly, followed by apartments, the construction of which is largely a collaboration of national construction actors and foreign property developers.
Meanwhile, industrial projects are expected to grow, supported by the government’s policy of increasing the investment target from Rp1,200 trillion in 2022 to Rp1,400 trillion.
The government is also encouraging development of new industrial estates in areas connected with new toll roads, thus attracting foreign investors thereby creating new growth areas.
This makes developers compete to build industrial estates.

The projects include key infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dams, ports, civil works and power plants.
As for utility sector, it is predicted to achieve a construction value of Rp21.19 trillion.
RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY  PROJECTION The development of new and renewable energy is still  slow.
new and renewable energy mix only increased by 0.55% annually over the past few years.
To achieve the new and renewable energy mix target of 23% of primary energy by 2025, there must be at least 2-3% growth per year.
The slow addition of new and renewable energy capacity was partly due to delays in the implementation of a number of new and renewable energy projects in RUPTL due to delays in several bidding processes and PLN regulation limiting large-scale rooftop PLTS capacity at 10-15% since January 2022.
Currently, the investment climate for new and  renewable energy is considered to be less attractive.
There is still a perception that new and renewable energy is expensive and uncompetitive compared to fossil energy.
In fact, fossil energy is cheap because it gets subsidies, starting from concessional finance for power plant construction to subsidized primary energy prices through DMO policy and electricity tariff subsidies.
Hence, new and renewable energy is still unable to compete and is required to be cheaper than subsidized fossil energy so that it can be purchased by PLN, which ultimately sacrifices the economic and financial feasibility of the project and becomes unbankable.
There are a number of positive sentiments that could  affect the prospects for new and renewable energy growth in 2023.
The government’s commitment to increasing new and renewable energy is stronger to achieve the target of 23% in 2025.
This can be seen, among others, from the approval of Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) agreed in G20 Bali 2022 event which targets a peak emission of 290 million tons of CO2e and a new and renewable energy mix target of 34% in 2030.

IPG will mobilize US$20 billion in funds over the next 3 - 5 years to help Indonesia transition from fossil fuels to new and renewable energy.
With the support of JETP, the government, PLN and all owners of electricity business areas will get cheap sources of funding to build new and renewable energy power plants more aggressively.
The 23% target will also be pursued by optimizing  operations of new and renewable energy power plants scheduled in PLN RUPTL and other than PLN, as well as utilizing biofuels (BBN).
In power plants, in addition to adding new and renewable energy generation capacity from this year’s delayed project, PLN’s co-firing program will continue to be increased to grow the portion of new and renewable energy mix.
The demand for industrial new and renewable energy  is also increasing.
A number of energy-intensive industries, such as cement, mineral refining and processing, mining, as well as data centers are ready to increase the use of new and renewable energy.
In addition to using rooftop solar power plants, the construction of ground mounted solar power plants and floating solar power plants is a quick solution for some industries.
A number of national industries have launched efforts  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of new and renewable energy and energy efficiency.
This commitment can be seen at Indonesia Net Zero Summit 2022 in November 2022.
Industries that use coal or gas-fired boilers have the opportunity to substitute them with biomass or other new and renewable energy sources to produce green heat.
This conversion will increase the use of non-electrical new and renewable energy.
Apart from this positive sentiment, increasing the new  and renewable energy mix is still highly dependent on PLN.
How PLN overcomes oversupply, conducts periodic and scheduled generator tenders and relaxes PLTS Roof permits, will determine the addition of new and renewable energy power plants.

However, the factors that affect global conditions are increasingly complex and unpredictable.
Global economic recession will potentially affect the commodity industry sector again due to falling demand, including coal.
The Company continues to consistently execute its  business diversification strategy to balance its business portfolio and create sustainable business growth, with the main focus on developing other mineral assets and increasing its new and renewable energy portfolio.
On the other hand, technology that continues to  develop rapidly will cause the Company’s current competitive advantage to quickly become obsolete in the future.
Therefore, the Company must have flexibility and readiness to face all challenges and changes, have a combination of prediction and mitigation, and the ability to anticipate when the situation becomes not conducive.
Construction Machinery Segment The prospect for Construction Machinery segment is predicted to remain very good in line with the positive trend of coal prices in the global market.
The increasing activities in heavy equipment user sectors can gradually be offset by an increase in heavy equipment production capacity with a multi-source strategy carried out by the principal.
In addition to securing unit supply, UT also improves the quality of product support services to maintain the performance of the units used by customers.
Therefore, UT must always be at the forefront in obtaining information on the readiness of heavy equipment to be able to prepare itself much better.
UT also continues to strive to increase market coverage  and to create product specifications with principals that suit customer needs, so that they are able to compete and adapt to market demands.
Simultaneously, digitalization continues to be developed to improve product support services and customer satisfaction.

The development process will take quite a long time, but the trend of shifting technology will be a major challenge for UT in the future.
Mining Contracting Segment The volatility of coal prices remains a major risk for PAMA’s business.
Coal prices movements will affect the production target of PAMA’s customers thereby affecting PAMA’s production.
PAMA continues to improve operational excellence by  increasing productivity and utilization of production equipment, implementing good mining practices, maintaining safety, occupational health and environmental performance, as well as striving to become a sustainable low-cost producer by achieving the best standard cost per bcm.
One of PAMA’s concerns of is energy transition.
The  use of coal, which is a high emitter of greenhouse gases, will continue to decrease with encouragement of Paris Agreement.
This poses a threat to coal-related businesses.
When there is a shift from the coal mining business to mineral mining, PAMA must be ready to transform from a heavy equipment-intensive new coal business to a capital and technology-intensive mineral business.
This is one of the prospects for Mining Contractor segment in the future which needs to be scrutinized and properly prepared.
Environment and climate change are strategic issues  that serve as guidelines for PAMA in developing business development strategies.
Therefore, PAMA consistently enlarges its mineral portfolio, such as gold and nickel by means of intensification and extensification in the country and abroad.
PAMA started research and development (R&D) activities to enter the mineral commodity business landscape.
In addition, through its subsidiaries, PAMA continues to enlarge the scale of new and renewable energy business which is focused on development of hydropower and rooftop solar PV.

In addition, coal mines must increase throughput to anticipate a decrease in coal demand in the long term.
On the other hand, mineral mining can still be  developed further as it has broad horizons, both in the country and abroad.
One of the opportunities that needs to be accelerated is commodity trading business, considering that this business is capable of becoming a very crucial cutting edge for expanding into the brownfield mineral business overseas.
Gold Mining Segment The prospect of gold mining is still positive as gold is a safe haven investment instrument.
The use of gold in technology, hedging instruments and jewellery will stabilize the prospects for gold demand in the future.
PTAR’s strategy is to continuously improve operational excellence, to maintain all-in-sustaining costs at a competitive level and to carry out initiatives to increase metal recovery.
Exploration to add resources and reserves continues to be carried out in Martabe and regional areas.
PTAR will build a new tailings management facility, conduct studies related to sulfides to extend the life of the mine and implement Martabe Limestone Project as one of cost efficiency and environmental compliance efforts.
Construction Industry Segment ACSET is optimistic that it will grow better in 2023 and beyond.
There are many positive prospects that can be explored, considering that the government opened the door for private construction players.
ACSET will focus more on ensuring the readiness of all lines so that they can survive through internal improvements in the short term and obtaining large and medium scale projects for the medium term.

ACSET remains selective in choosing construction projects that are in accordance with its competence and capacity.
In addition, ACSET will explore more opportunities and leverage the strength of the Company’s group’s value chain.
Internal improvements in 2022 are expected to bring benefits as industrial situation and condition recover.
The big challenge that ACSET may face is the delay in  investments in construction projects because capital owners are taking wait-and-see position towards 2024 election and anticipating direction of the new government’s policies in the construction sector.
Renewable Energy Segment The year 2023 promises better prospects for Indonesia’s energy transition.
In September 2022, the government issued Presidential Decree 112/2022 which brought fresh air to the new and renewable energy sector.
EPN’s priority is to ensure that PLTM projects that  are already in the construction phase run according to schedule.
PLTM Besai Kemu is targeted to operate commercially in 2023, while PLTM developed by Arkora, namely PLTM Yaentu and PLTM Kukusan, are scheduled to operate commercially in early 2023 and 2024.
Simultaneously, EPN continues to accelerate addition of the operational portfolio with hydro and solar power plants either organically or non-organically.
EPN actively explores development of other new and  renewable energy, such as wind, geothermal, hybrid solar PV with battery storage and waste-to-energy.
One of EPN’s initiatives is to establish strategic partnerships with internationally reputable energy companies to develop new and renewable energy projects.
EPN also continues to look for opportunities either organically or through acquisition of operational assets of new and renewable energy.
This is in line with energy transition strategy and sustainable business portfolio expansion.
