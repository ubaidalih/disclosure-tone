TRANSMISSION BUSINESS SEGMENT Natural gas transmission business segment transports  natural gas belonging to the shipper from the receiving  point, which is a gas field or other sources to handover  point (off-taker) through a high-pressurized pipeline.
In this business segment, PGN operates transmission  pipeline so as to supply natural gas belonging to  the shipper and receive toll fees, of which amount is  determined by BPH Migas.
In addition to PGN, TGI, KJG  and PT Pertamina Gas serve as operators for their own  transmission pipelines.
Besides transporting natural gas belonging to the shipper,  PGN also transports its own natural gas to support its  business activities, as governed in the Government  Regulation No. 36 of 2004 concerning Downstream  Oil and Gas Business as last amended by Government  Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 30 of  2009.
This transportation of its own natural gas, PGN  does not aim at earning profit, as it does not receive any  toll fee.
Transmission volume operated by associated entity KJG  is presented in information on operations performance  of the transmission segment.
report, however, KJG contribution is presented as finance  lease revenue.
While that of TGI is not consolidated, but  instead considered in the Profit from Joint Venture.
PORTFOLIO OF PGN TRANSMISSION PIPELINE Up to December 31, 2020, PGN has a 5,073 Km  transmission pipeline used to transport natural gas has  a special right, support business activities, and becomes  part of receiving and regasification terminal, of which  includes transmission pipeline for associated entity, TGI.
Detail is as follows: Notes: 1)  Transmission pipes as part of receival terminal facility and LNG  regasification 2)  PT Pertamina Gas pipes were only presented in 2018 in line with the  implementation year of integration of PT Pertamina Gas to PGN.
Beside gas transmission business, PGN also transports  oil through pipelines carried out by PT Pertamina Gas  serving as an operator for oil transmission pipelines.
In  presenting financial report, contribution from this oil  transportation, however, is recorded and considered as  revenue from other business segments.
INFRASTRUCTURE GROWTH OF DISTRIBUTION AND  TRANSMISSION PIPELINES  Up to December 31, 2020, PGN’s 10,688 Km long  pipeline was divided into 5,073 Km long of transmission  pipeline and 5,615 Km long of distribution pipeline.
PERFORMANCE OF COMMERCIAL AND TRANSMISSION  BUSINESS SEGMENT  Gas Commercial Business Segment Performance In 2020, the number of commercial customers receiving  natural gas from PGN is 828 BBTUD decreased by 123  BBTUD or 13% compared to 2019.
Explanation on Performance Increase/Decrease of Gas  Trading Distribution Such decrease in gas commercial volume is particularly  due to lower demand in almost of all industrial &  electricity sectors as an impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
Performance of Transmission Business Segment Note: 1) Including TGI & KJG In 2020, volume of natural gas transported through  PGN’s natural gas transmission pipeline was 1,255  MMSCFD (excluding TGI), or decreased by 114 MMSCFD  or -8% compared to that of 2019.
Explanation on Transmission Increase/Decrease Decrease in transmission volume is particularly due to  reduced demand as an impact of Covid-19 pandemic,  reduced production supply from shipper of PT Pertamina  Gas, and since September 2019 ceased supply of natural  gas through transmission pipeline Kepodang-Tambak  Lorok, which is operated by KJG, due to unexpected  decline from wells.
Performance Commercial and Transmission Gas  Business Segment in terms of Profitability Gas Commercial business segment is the main contributor  to the Company's revenue, 80% of the Company's  revenue is contributed from this segment.
In 2020,  gas commercial revenues reached USD2,299.8 million  or decreased by 23% or USD674,2 million compared  to 2019 which amounted to USD2,973.9 million.
The  decline in Commercial business segment revenue due to  a decrease in the sales volume of Natural Gas in the midst  of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In line with the Gas Commercial business segment which  was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Natural  Gas Transmission business segment also experienced a  decrease in volume.
In 2020, natural gas transmission  revenues amounted to USD240.3 million or decreased  by 2% or USD5.4 million compared to 2019 which  amounted to USD245.7 million.
For the contribution of transmission income from  Affiliates, namely KJG and TGI, the presentation in  the consolidated financial statements is recorded in  the form of finance lease for KJG, while for TGI it is  recorded as part of profit from joint ventures.
Natural  Gas Transmission activities carried out by KJG stopped  due to the cessation of supply of natural gas through the  Kepodang-Tambak Lorok transmission pipe in September  2019, so that in 2020 there was no finance lease revenue  from KJG.
Whereas in the previous year, KJG's revenues  was USD18 million.
The contribution of gas transmission  revenue from TGI, which was recorded as part of the  profit from joint ventures in 2020, was USD29.6 million,  an increase of USD260 thousand or 0.89% from the  previous year which was USD29.4 million.
The profitability of the Commercial / Transmission  business segment in 2020 was USD388,5 million or  decreased by USD403 million or 51% compared to 2019  which amounted to USD791.6 million.
This decline  was due to a decline in market demand for natural  gas in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the  enactment of the Minister of ESDM Decree No. 89K/10/ MEM/2020 and the Minister of ESDM Decree No.  91K/12MEM/2020.
The decrease in Gross Profit from  the Gas Trading segment was USD170.7 million and from  the Gas Transmission segment by USD28.8 million.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND  PRODUCTION BUSINESS SEGMENT   The oil and gas exploration and production business  segment is PGN's business activities and investments  in the upstream oil and gas sector, which include  exploration, exploitation and business development in  the oil and gas sector.
This business activity is a form  of PGN's efforts to expand its portfolio in the energy  business chain through PT Saka Energi Indonesia (SEI).
In this business segment, SEI receives revenue from  lifting oil, natural gas, LPG and LNG.
Meanwhile, the  main expenses required in this business activity include  production and lifting costs, depreciation costs for  oil and gas assets, and allocation of costs related to  exploration and exploitation.
In 2020, SEI manages a portfolio of 11 blocks of oil and  gas with the status of 6 blocks in production and 5 blocks  in the exploration stage, 10 blocks located in Indonesia  and 1 block in the United States.
Operations Performance of Oil and Gas Exploration and  Production Business Segment in terms of Operations  and Production In 2020, SEI continues to carry out production and  exploration activities for its portfolio of oil and gas  blocks.
From these activities, several commodities were  produced, namely oil, natural gas, LPG and LNG.
The  lifting volume of each product is as follows:  In 2020, the lifting performance of SEI reached 7.47  mmboe, decreased by 2.83 mmboe or 27% compared to  2019 which amounted to 10.30 mmboe.
Explanation of Increase/Decrease in the Performance of  Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Business  This decline was mainly due to the falling demand as  the result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Especially LNG  production in Muara Bakau, which is affected by the  decline in demand for LNG, both domestically and  globally.
In addition, there has been a halt in production  in the Muriah block since September 2019 due to  unexpected decline from wells.
Sebagai penyedia jaringan fiber optik Performance of the Oil and Gas Exploration and  Production Business Segment in terms of Income/ Profitability In 2020, revenue from the oil and gas exploration and  production business segment was USD203.7 million  or decreased by 46% or equivalent to USD171 million  compared to 2019 which amounted to USD374.4 million.
This decrease was due to several things, including a  decrease in curtailment in the Muara Bakau Block which  caused the gross production rate to decrease by 172  MMSCFD, delays in completing drilling of the Z-9 and  Z-11 wells in the Ketapang Block; decreased production  due to the cancellation of 10 wells in Fasken due to  low Henry Hub's gas price, and the delay in startup  production in the Muriah Block, which was originally  expected to start production in 2020.
In addition, there  was also the Covid-19 pandemic-related factor which  resulted in lower demand and lower oil prices.
The decline in revenue greatly affected the profitability  of the oil and gas exploration and production business  segment, which suffered a loss of USD64.7 million or  decreased by 295% or equivalent to USD98.0 million  compared to 2019 which record profit amounted to  USD33.3 million.
This decrease in profitability was due  to a decrease in income which was not immediately  followed by a decrease in the cost of revenue because in  the cost of income there was an element of depreciation  whose amount was not proportional to the value of the  income.
OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS Other business segments are other businesses that are  directly related to and/or support PGN's main business  in accordance with the prevailing laws and regulations  through its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.
Other business  activities include:  1.
Telecommunication  PT PGAS Telekomunikasi Nusantara or PGASCOM  is a subsidiary of PGN which is engaged in  telecommunication services and Information and  Communication Technology services.

KJG's main business  is natural gas transmission, however, the impact  of the implementation of PSAK No. 30 concerning  leases and ISAK No. 8 concerning the interpretation  of transactions containing leases resulted in KJG's  transmission revenue being presented as finance lease  revenue in other business segment.
Oil Transportation and Gas Processing  Since PT Pertamina Gas joined the PGN business line,  there have been additional new business segments,  namely oil transportation and gas processing.
In the  oil transportation business, PT Pertamina Gas receives  a toll fee for distributing oil through its pipeline  infrastructure.
As for gas processing, PT Pertamina  Gas produces LPG which is used to meet LPG needs in  the domestic market.
Performance of Other Business Segments in terms of  Production/Operations The performance of other business segments also  contributed to the company's business.
This segment  consists of the telecommunications sector, oil  transportation, finance lease, gas processing, facility &  asset management, as well as construction and O&M.
For the Construction and O&M as well as Facility & Asset  Management segments, most of the performance was  eliminated with the Parent Entity because most of its  efforts were to support PGN's performance.
In general,  the performance of other business segments can be  shown in the following table: Explanation of Increase/Decrease in the Performance  of Other Business Segments The performance of the telecommunications sector  in 2020 increased by 16% compared to 2019.
This  increase was mainly contributed by the increase in the  sales capacity of bandwidth to external customers by  increasing online work or Work from Home due to the  effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
Meanwhile, the  finance lease performance recorded a volume of zero  due to there was no gas supply through the Kepodang- Tambak Lorok pipeline as unexpected decline from  Kepodang Field since September 2019.
The gas processing sector in 2020 also experienced a  27% decline compared to 2019 due to a shutdown at the  ENP LPG Plant due to the low LPG price which was below  the economics of the LPG Plant.
The oil transportation  sector in 2020 decreased by 2% compared to 2019 in  line with the decrease in the volume of oil transported  by PT Pertamina Gas.
For the Construction and O&M  Annual Report 2020 147 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN Management Discussion and AnalysisAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisPT Pertamina Gas.
and Facility & Asset Management segments, most of  the performance was eliminated with the Parent Entity  because most of its efforts were to support PGN's  performance.
Performance of Other Business Segments in terms of  Revenue/Profitability In 2020, revenue from other business segments  decreased 44% from USD254.8 5 million in 2019 to  USD141.72 million.
This decrease was mainly due to a  decrease in revenue from the Finance Lease segment due  to there was no gas supply to Kepodang-Tambak Lorok  transmission pipeline in September 2019 which was  operated by KJG.
In addition, there was also a decrease  in gas processing revenues due to the lower of LPG Price.
Covid-19 pandemic also caused several projects planned  in 2020 to be postponed so that revenue from other  segments - construction, has decreased very significantly.
Meanwhile, the segment that did not experience a decline  was the Fiber Optic Rental Revenue made by PGASCOM.
Even so, the profitability of other business segments  actually increased by 373% from a loss of USD30.9  million in 2019 to USD83.9 million in 2020.
This was due  to the massive efficiency made to adapt to the conditions  of the Covid-19 pandemic.
There are impairments on  KJG's fixed assets of USD98 million, while in 2020,  impairments of fixed assets in KJG were USD8.37 million  or smaller, amounting to USD89.5 million.
DESCRIPTION OF FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE Financial Performance 2020 still recorded positive  operational performance by posting an operating profit  of USD303.7 million.
However, due to external factors  beyond the company's control, the company had to book  a loss for the period attributable to owners of the parent  entity in 2020 amounting to USD264.7 million.
The first factor that caused the company to book a  loss was the decline in the performance of the Gas  Commercial business segment.
The decrease in Gross  Profit was mainly due to a decrease in demand for  natural gas from the market as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic.
Many PGN customers, especially industrial  customers, reduced their production capacity to adapt  to the pandemic conditions.
The reduction in production  capacity will reduce natural gas consumption.
In addition  to the Covid-19 pandemic, the decline in performance  of this business segment was also due to the enactment  of the Minister of ESDM Decree No. 89K/10/MEM/2020  ("Kepmen ESDM No 89") and Kepmen ESDM No.  91K/12/MEM/ 2020 ("Kepmen ESDM No 91").
Both of  these resulted in a decrease in Gross Profit of USD170.7  million.
In addition to the decrease in Gross Profit for the  Commercial segment, the Company must booked tax  provisions pursuant to financial accounting standards  amounting to USD278.4 million in 2020 for 2012 and  2013 VAT tax disputes.
The next factor that caused the Company to book a loss  was the decline in the financial performance of the Oil  and Gas sector which was mainly caused by the decline  in oil prices in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,  decreased production of oil and gas lifting due to  curtailment and production delays in several blocks and  natural declining of asset reserves which resulted in the  Oil and Gas sector experiencing a decline gross profit  amounting USD103.7 million.
In addition to the decrease  in Gross Profit, the upstream sector also had to book  an impairment of USD78.9 million on oil and gas assets  because the oil and gas price market conditions had not  yet recovered, there was a change in reserve, a planned  production profile that affected the recoverable value of  oil and gas assets.
Throughout 2020, the Company has made efforts to  maintain the company's performance through operational  cost efficiency measures that can reduce the company's  operating expenses by USD180.4 million compared to  the previous year.
Volume NET REVENUE Net revenue comes from three PGN business segments,  namely gas commercial/transmission, oil and gas  exploration and production, and other businesses that  include (1) gas processing, (2) finance leases, (3) oil  transportation, (4) fiber optic rental and (5) others in the  form of: construction and operation and maintenance.
The contribution of each business to operating income in  2020 is as follows: During 2020, PGN posted a net revenue of USD2.89  billion, 25% decreasing compared to 2019, which  amounted to USD3.85 billion.
The decline in revenue  was due to lower revenue from the Gas Commercial,  Gas Transmission, and Oil and Gas business segments,  which are the three largest revenue contributors.
The  Gas Commercial business segment's revenue decreased  in 2020 amounting to USD674.2 million, down 23%  compared to 2019.
Gas Commercial business segment  revenue contributed 80% to consolidated revenue.
The decline in revenue was influenced by the enactment  of Ministerial Decree No. 89 and Ministerial Decree  No. 91 and COVID-19 pandemic.
The enactment of  Ministerial Decrees No. 89 and No. 91 stipulates that  the selling price of gas to customers included in the  Ministerial Decree is USD6/MMBTU.
The selling price  reduces the revenue from the Gas Commercial business  segment.
Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic caused  a decline in market demand, especially gas demand  from natural gas user industries, which reduced their  production capacity.
With the decline in demand for gas  in the market, the business segments of Gas Commercial  Transmission and Gas Processing decreased in volume.
Both of these had an impact on  the decline in revenue for the Gas Commercial business  segment.
The volume of gas transmission during 2020 was 1,255  MMSCFD, a decrease of 115 MMSCFD or 8% compared  to 2019, which amounted to 1,379 MMSCFD.
As a result,  gas transmission revenue decreased by USD5.4 million or  2% to USD240.3 million in 2020 from USD245.7 million  in 2019.
The volume of natural gas processing during 2020 was  46,863 tons, down 17,232 tons or 27% compared to  2019, 64,095 tons, resulting in a decrease in revenue  from the gas processing business segment which is part  of other business segments by USD55.4 million or a  decrease of 40% to USD83.7 million in 2020 compared  to 2019 which amounted to USD139.0 million.
In the oil and gas segment, the factors causing the  decline in revenue were mainly due to the delay in  startup production in the Muriah Block, the decrease  in production rate in the Muara Bakau Block, the  cancellation of 10 wells in Fasken due to low gas prices,  and the delay in completing well drilling in the Ketapang  Block which resulted in a decrease in oil and gas lifting.
amounting to 2.83 MBOE to 7.47 MBOE in 2020 from  the previous 10.30 MBOE and the decline in world oil  prices due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
These factors  have resulted in a decrease in revenue for the Oil and  Gas segment in 2020 to USD170.7 million to become  USD203.7 million from USD374.4 million in 2019.
PGN posted revenue from the oil transportation business  segment of USD18.0 million during 2020, or a decrease  of 11% from 2019, USD20.2 million.
This decrease was  caused by a decrease in the volume of distribution of oil  transmission by PT Pertamina Gas.
In 2020, there is no gas distribution through the KJG  pipeline so there is no finance lease revenue.
Meanwhile,  in the previous year, there was a revenue of USD18.4  million.
Due to the cessation of the transportation of  natural gas, the arbitration process is currently still  running so that the company's rights in accordance with  applicable legal provisions may be recovered.
PGN's business segment that has not experienced a  decline is the fiber optic rental business segment, which  posted revenues of USD18.5 million, an increase of 1%  compared to 2019 of USD18.4 million.
contributed to revenue of USD21.6 million or a decrease  of 63% compared to 2019 which amounted to USD58.8  million.
This condition is due to delays in projects that are  planned to be implemented in 2020 due to the Covid-19  pandemic.
COST OF REVENUE PGN's cost of revenue in 2020 consists of purchasing  natural gas from suppliers, oil and gas operating  expenses, purchasing LNG and operating FSRUs,  expenses related to natural gas processing and  other expenses in the form of: cost of revenue from  construction of natural gas pipelines.
as well as  management, leasing of buildings and equipment.
The  total cost of revenue for 2020 was USD2,031.1 million, a  decrease of USD590.2 million or 23% compared to 2019  which amounted to USD2,621.3 million.
The decrease in the cost of revenue was mainly due to  the decrease in the cost of the natural gas purchased  from the suppliers by USD488.2 million.
The cost of  purchasing gas from suppliers contributed 81% to the  total consolidated cost of revenue.
The cost of natural gas purchases of USD1.6 billion came  from several suppliers, including ConocoPhilips (Grissik)  Ltd, PT Pertamina EP, and other suppliers.
In 2020, the cost of revenue from oil and gas was  USD261.62 million, a decrease of 20% compared  to 2019 which amounted to USD328.6 million.
This  condition is due to a decrease in the lifting volume of oil,  gas, and LPG from the already producing SEI’s oil and gas  area.

of these assets.
If there is any indication at the time of  testing for impairment of assets, the Company will make  a formal estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount determined for an individual  asset is the higher value between asset fair value or  Cash Generating Unit (CGU) deducted by selling costs  and its value in use, unless the asset does not generate  cash inflows that are largely independent of other  assets or groups of assets.
If the carrying amount of an  asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is greater than  its recoverable amount, then the asset is considered  impaired and the carrying value of the asset is reduced to  its recoverable amount.
In calculating the value in use, the estimated net future  cash flows are discounted to their present value using  a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the asset  specification risk.
In determining fair value deducted by  selling costs, the last market price is used, if any.
If there  is no such transaction, the Company uses an appropriate  valuation model to determine the fair value of the asset.
This calculation is corroborated by multiple valuations  or available fair value indicators.
An assessment is made  at the end of each reporting date on whether there is an  indication that an impairment loss recognized in previous  period / year may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any indication is found, the entity will estimate the  recoverable amount of asset or CGU.
An impairment loss  that has been recognized in the previous period/year for  an asset other than reversed goodwill only when there  has been a change in the assumptions used to determine  the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment  loss was recognized.
In this case, the carrying amount of  asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
The reversal  is limited so that the carrying amount of asset does not  exceed its recoverable amount or the carrying amount,  net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been  recognized for the asset in previous period/year.
Reversal  of impairment loss is recognized as profit or loss.
After  such reversal, depreciation of asset is adjusted in future  periods so as to allocate the asset's revised carrying  amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis  over its remaining life cycle.
The decline in the value of Exploration and Evaluation  Assets in 2020 amounted to USD3 million due to the end  of exploration and evaluation period.

Several conditions  caused the Company’s failure in achieving target set  in previous year.
The following is a summary of the  achievement of PGN's performance targets in 2020.
ANALYSIS ON REALIZATION OF  OPERATION/PRODUCTION AND  MARKETING  Realization of natural gas business in 2020 consists  of gas commercial of 828 BBTUD or 101.7% of 2020  RKAP (the Company’s Workplan an Budget) and gas  transmission of 1,255 MMSCFD or 97.5% of 2020 RKAP.
Operational performance in gas commercial segment was  achieved above RKAP target 2020, while operational  performance in the gas transmission segment that has  not reached its target is due to external factors beyond  the company's control.
The decrease in the volume of natural gas transmission  is mainly due to changes in the operating pattern of  generating unit at the Paya Pasir MPP because PLN is  optimizing the electricity load on Sumatra electricity  transmission network so that there is generation  efficiency by MPP Paya Pasir which affects the decrease  in demand for distribution of the Paya Pasir MPP,  decrease of PLN Belawan consumption due to optimizing  other plants, PUSRI's consumption of natural gas has  not been optimal due to unscheduled shutdowns, PLN  Indralaya has stopped operating due to maintenance  activities, and Kujang Pupuk’s consumption has not been  stable due to shutdown.

Total net revenue in 2020 was USD2,885.5 million or  99.6% of 2020 RKAP.
It was mainly due to operational  volume in gas transmission segment and oil and gas  lifting which had not been realized in accordance with  2020 RKAP.
On the other hand, operating costs were  realized below RKAP 2020, However, due to there was  any recognition of tax provision, thus affecting the  achievement of operating profit specified in 2020 RKAP,  which is USD303.7 million or 94.5% of 2020 RKAP.
ANALYSIS ON REALIZATION OF PROFIT/ LOSS Total Net Profit/(Loss) in 2020 is (USD264.8 million)  or -531% of 2020 RKAP.
It was mainly due to non-cash  items such as provisions for tax disputes and decrease in  value of oil and gas properties.

MATERIAL INFORMATION AFTER  REPORTING YEAR After the reporting date, there is no material information  happened to PGN and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
BUSINESS PROSPECT The Covid-19 pandemic, which crippled economic  activity around the world, even caused recessin in  several countries, including Indonesia.
The pandemic  prompted the government to limit many activities, from  tourism to educational activities, which had a significant  impact on the economy.
Global economic conditions  in 2021 are predicted to be in a recovery phase.
The  government through the Ministry of Finance estimates  that the Indonesian economy will grow by 4.5% -5.3% in  2021, this growth is supported by the global economic  recovery, government fiscal stimulus and the acceleration  of Covid-19 vaccination.
Apart from the aforementioned factors, the fundamentals  of efforts to restore the business climate are supported  by household consumption with a contribution of more  than 50%, apart from government spending, investment  and export-import.
Government’s support through the  Job Creation Law is expected to be reflected in future  economic recovery and growth.
With the successful  handling of Covid-19 and economic recovery, Community  and industrial activities are expected to gradually return  to normal so that it will have a positive impact on energy  consumption in general and natural gas energy in  particular.
The transformation of PT Pertamina (Persero) as an Oil  and Gas Holding has given PGN a role as an operating  Subholding Gas.
This causes PGN to directly manage  the natural gas business including LNG in an end-to- end manner.
To carry out this mandate, PGN will focus  on strategic matters and grow the business segment.
In addition, PGN has also carried out a transformation  in which PGN acts as the manager of natural gas and  LNG trading while the Subsidiaries act as managers of  infrastructure and services.
Through this transformation,  PGN is expected to be able to make a better contribution  to all shareholders.
For domestic market, the LNG business will have a  major contribution through the conversion project from  fuel to LNG for PLN's power plants.
The company has  signed an agreement to implement the project with PLN.
Meanwhile, for foreign markets, the company approaches  LNG business players in the target countries, namely  the Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand.
The  company has intensive discussions with the Ministry of  BUMN and the Indonesian Embassy.
Apart from that, the  company has also started targeting the global market  with the target countries of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China,  Southeast Asian countries, India, Pakistan, Turkey and  European countries .
Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Annual Report 2020 177 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN Management Discussion and AnalysisManagement Discussion and AnalysisIn 2021, the company also projects natural gas sales  growth due to the adjustment of PLN's natural gas  absorption plan according to the PLN RUPTL and  recovery of Industrial Customers affected by COVID-19.
In addition, it is also planned to add several bulk  customers in the Lifting Oil (Refinery) and Power Plant  sector, development of LNG Retail in East Java and  Central Java, as well as additional Industrial customers  in existing areas (Customer Attachment).
For the  Household sector, it is planned to add additional Jargas  APBN customers in early 2021 and additional Jargas  Mandiri customers at the end of 2021.
Then for 2022  to 2026, it is planned to add bulk customers for the  refinery, fertilizer, power generation, smelter, and LNG  Transportation sectors.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT The company has prepared a number of strategic steps  to seize business opportunities and develop business  throughout the natural gas business chain in Indonesia.
As a Subholding Gas, in the future PGN will strengthen its  core business in the field of natural gas management.
A  number of initiatives to dominate the natural gas market  have been launched, not only strengthening the domestic  market share but also leading to the international market.
GAS FOR LAND TRANSPORTATION The conversion of natural gas for transportation becomes  a strategic program that is being encouraged again.
This program is very strategic because it replaces fuel  for vehicles with domestic natural gas sources.
It also  provides benefits in the form of efficiency to users  because the energy equivalent price is lower than that  of fuel.
The natural gas conversion program for land  transportation is one of PGN's Sapta Programs, namely  the PGN Land Sector.
The number of vehicles operating  throughout Indonesia is enormous, so the potential  for utilization of natural gas for land transportation  is very high.
As an initial stage, the types of vehicles  to be converted are passenger vehicles, trucks and  buses located in Sumatra, Java, East Kalimantan, South  Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and Bali based on the  availability of supporting infrastructure.
Conversion from fuel to gas can answer the problems  currently being faced in Indonesia, including high  fuel imports, increasing fuel subsidies, domestic gas  production surpluses, and the optimization of SPBG  infrastructure, which is still low.
GAS FOR SEA TRANSPORTATION Indonesia is a country where 2/3 of its total area is  oceans.
Therefore, high sea transportation connectivity is  needed to connect between islands.
Based on data from  the Ministry of Transportation, in 2019, the number of  ships operating in Indonesia was 32,587.
With the high  amount of fuel consumption for one ship, the potential  for natural gas conversion for sea transportation is very  promising.
In addition, in 2020 the IMO Sulfur Cap 2020  regulations have been implemented in several countries  with a maximum sulfur emission threshold of 0.5% for  ships passing through the Emission Control Area (ECA  - SOx).
Until now, one of the fuels that can be used to  produce sulfur exhaust emissions below 0.5% is natural  gas.
The gas conversion program for sea transportation  is in line with PGN's Sapta Program i.
, PGN Maritime  Sector.
As an initial stage, the ships to be converted are vessels  owned by Pertamina Group, vessels owned by BUMN,  and large capacity private commercial vessels.
The  current amount of ship fuel that will be converted to  natural gas is 50% given the limited availability of  supporting infrastructure in Indonesia.
Some of the  supporting infrastructure is currently in East Kalimantan,  Aceh, Lampung, West Java and East Java.
Similar to the  land sector, the conversion of BBM to BBG in the marine  sector can answer the problems currently being faced  in Indonesia, including high fuel imports, increasing  fuel subsidies, and a surplus in domestic natural gas  production.
WASTE MANAGEMENT INTO ENERGY Waste is a common problem, especially for urban areas  due to population growth followed by the urbanization  process and changes in consumption patterns from  natural to artificial materials.
If not handled properly,  waste can have a negative impact on the environment  and public health.
Garbage that is difficult to decompose  will cause soil pollution, waste that is burned openly  (open burning) will produce gases that can pollute the  air, and seepage water from waste decomposition will  cause water pollution.
So far, the paradigm of waste  management in Indonesia is collect-transport-dump  which will only add to the burden of landfills (TPA).
On the other hand, limited land is also a problem.
Therefore, a breakthrough is needed related to  technology development and waste management  business, one of which is through the implementation of  waste into energy management.
PGN Group Badan Usaha Berfasilitas Facilitated Business Entities8% 92% Several government policies that support the waste-to- energy management program, especially the combustion  mix at Co-firing PLTU, have also created opportunities  for companies to enter.
Even though it is not in the core  business capacity as natural gas subholding, waste-to- energy management can become a link for the energy  transition in Indonesia.
NATURAL GAS DOWNSTREAM PROGRAM In mid-June 2020, PGN has a new mission, namely  business development through the use of natural gas  for the gas-based industry and its derivatives.
This is  also made clear in the PGN Sapta Program, namely  PGN supports Special Industries including the gas  supply support program for the new captive market  (Downstream Portfolio for Natural Gas Utilization).
One of the projects in the Natural Gas Downstream  program that is being developed is Gas to Methanol &  Dymethil Ether (DME).
Methanol derivative products are  raw materials for the chemical industry, engine fuels,  and additives.
One of the methanol derivative products,  namely DME, can be utilized as cooking fuel or as a  substitute for LPG.
Gas to Methanol & DME is PGN's  effort to help the government in order to save methanol  imports, import LPG, and optimize the use of natural gas  exports.
MARKETING ASPECTS MARKET SHARE In 2020, natural gas production in Indonesia has reach  ± 5,600 MMSCFD.
In the utilization of natural gas, the  PGN Group has managed ± 2000 MMSCFD or 37% of  Indonesia's natural gas production.
In the commercial  segment, the PGN Group controls around 92.3% of the  natural gas trading market share through distribution  pipelines in Indonesia.
The domination of the national  natural gas trade market share in 2020 has increased  compared to 92%.
recorded in 2019.
CUSTOMER PROFILE In 2020, PGN distributed natural gas to households,  small customers and commercial-industrial customers  as many as 495,935 customers, an increase compared  to 2019 which amounted to 397,474 customers.
The  number of PGN customers is currently dominated by the  household customer segment amounting to 99% of the  total natural gas customers PGN.
Over the past 5 years,  the number of PGN customers has grown.
Based on the volume of distribution of natural gas to  customers, the commercial-industrial customer segment  has the largest portion, accounting for 99.4% of PGN's  total natural gas distribution.
ADJUSTMENT OF NATURAL GAS SELLING PRICES The adjustment to PGN's natural gas selling price is  influenced by changes in the purchase price of natural  gas, the cost of transporting gas from the transporter,  market dynamics, global economic conditions, and  changes in government regulations.
The government has  issued several regulations regarding the regulation of  natural gas trading business in Indonesia, including: •  Regulation of the Minister of ESDM Number 6 of 2016  concerning Provisions and Procedures for Determining  the Allocation and Utilization and Price of Natural Gas.
Kabupaten Wajo•  Regulation of the Minister of ESDM Number 58  of 2017 concerning the Selling Price of Natural  Gas through Pipes in Oil and Gas Downstream  Business Activities as amended by Regulation of the  Minister of ESDM Number 14 of 2019 concerning  Amendments to the Regulation of the Minister of  ESDM Number 58 of 2017.
•  Regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources Number 4 of 2018 concerning Natural Gas  Business in the Downstream Oil and Gas Business  Activities.
The regulation of the Minister of ESDM as mentioned  above will make the selling price of natural gas in  the natural gas trading business regulated.
The  implementation of this regulation will be carried out no  later than June 2019.
In the context of conformity to the process of selling  natural gas through pipelines, PGN has submitted a  proposed selling price for natural gas to the Minister  of ESDM to obtain a determination through letter No.  029502.
S/PP.01.01/PDO/2019 dated 18 July 2019  regarding the Proposed Selling Price of Natural Gas  through Pipes in Downstream Oil and Gas Business  Activities based on Permen ESDM under No. 58/2017.
The company is still having intensive discussions with the  Government regarding plan to implement the adjustment  of the industrial sector's natural gas selling price.
Meanwhile, for the household sector, the Government  through BPH Migas has stipulated regulations regarding  the selling price of natural gas per City / Regency for  the household and small customer segments.
In 2020,  PGN will determine the selling price of natural gas in  accordance with regulations from BPH Migas, in the  following areas: 1.
Dumai City 2.
Jambi City 3.
Depok City 4.
Cirebon City 5.
Cirebon District 6.
Probolinggo District  10.
Mojokerto District  11.
In addition, over the past three years, PGN's average  natural gas price has tended to be stable and experienced  a downward trend in the last year, while HSD and MFO  prices correlated with global oil prices which tended to  experience an upward trend in the range of Q4 2020  despite experiencing a downward trend.
in the II & III  Quarter of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
MARKETING STRATEGY PGN is committed to continuing to develop services  and utilization of national natural gas by developing  infrastructure to increase the utilization of natural gas in  Indonesia.
PGN has consistently improved towards a customer  centric concept to better understand customers,  emphasizing the concepts of customer focus, customer  experience and experiential marketing.

Description and Influence of Important Events in  2020 that have a significant effect on the Company's  business continuity: a.
Dispute Cases Over Transactions for the 2012 and  2013 Fiscal Years The 2012 dispute was motivated by the issuance  of the Minister of Finance Regulation No.252  / PMK.011 / 2012 dated December 28, 2012  which explains that natural gas that is not subject  to VAT includes natural gas that is flowed through  pipelines.
According to the DGT, Natural Gas sold  by PGN is processed gas which has increased  the value of goods so that it is subject to VAT of  10% and PMK-252 / PMK.011 / 2012 is a new  application on December 28, 2012.
On this basis,  DGT issued a bill VAT for the period 1 Jan-27 Dec  2012 amounting to IDR 3.26 trillion.
Meanwhile,  according to PGN, there is no in-gas processing  that is sold by PGN to customers, PGN receives  gas in accordance with the Gas Sales Agreement  ("GSA") from the KKKS with specifications  regulated by government regulations and directly  sells the gas to customers without any process /  processing, so that according to the provisions of  Article 4A paragraph (2), letter a, the PPN Law  and its explanation, the delivery of natural gas by  PGN is not subject to VAT.
PMK-252 / PMK.011  / 2012 only on non-VAT objects regulated in the  VAT Law.
PGN has received a confirmation letter  Laporan Tahunan 2020 198 Answering The ChallengesINFORMASI KELANGSUNGAN USAHA Information on Business Continuity  menegaskan non-objek PPN yang telah diatur  di dalam UU PPN.
Regarding this dispute, PGN has  submitted legal remedies until the application  is approved and a decision is obtained that the  application for submission has been completely  granted by the Tax Court, however, the Director  General of Taxes has submitted extraordinary  legal remedies in the form of Reconsideration to  the Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, the 2013 dispute was motivated by  the determination of PGN's natural gas selling  price in 2 (two) currency units (USD/ MMBTU and  IDR / m3) starting in 1998.
DGT considers that  the Rp/ m3 bill is a replacement for distribution  services which is the object of VAT.
and issuing  invoices for the years 2013 sd 2017 amounting to  IDR 4.71Trillion.
PGN has explained that the bill  in USD/ MMBTU and IDR / m3 is a unitary price  of natural gas which is not subject to VAT.
PGN  has also received confirmation from the Director  General of Taxes (DGT) No.
S-2 / PJ.02 / 2020  dated January 15, 2020, which confirms that  the activity of flowing natural gas (distribution)  is included in the delivery of natural gas that is  flowed through pipes which is not subject to VAT.
In addition, the DGT has also fully granted the  objection request submitted by PGN for SKPKB  PPN for distribution services for the 2014-2017  Fiscal Year, with a total value of the canceled  SKPKB of IDR 3.82 trillion.
As for the 2013 VAT  dispute of Rp892.06 billion, PGN has submitted  legal action up to the appeal request with the  result of the decision that the entire application  for appeal was granted by the Tax Court,  however, the Director General of Taxes submitted  extraordinary legal remedies in the form of  reconsideration to the Supreme Court.
VAT dispute over natural gas in 2012-2013  consists of 24 cases in the Supreme Court, 18  cases have been handed down by granting DGT  Review (“PK”), while 6 cases have not been  handed down.
Based on the copy of PK decision  received, the Supreme Judge's consideration in  deciding the case did not take into account PGN's  rebuttal conveyed in the Counter Memories,  especially those related to DGT's affirmation in  letter S-2 / PJ.02 / 2020 dated January 15, 2020.
For this reason, on January 12, 2021, PGN has  Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Annual Report 2020 199 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN Management Discussion and Analysis 15 Januari 2020.
Pengunduran diri dilakukan submitted an Additional Counter Memorandum  of Review explaining the existence of DGT letter  number S-2 / PJ.02 / 2020.
In addition, PGN  has also received written expert statements  (Affidavit) from 2 professors who expressed their  opinion that in terms of concept, philosophy, and  regulations it has consistently stipulated since  1985 that natural gas is not an object of VAT.
This affidavit has been submitted to the Supreme  Court via Tax Court in Addition Counter Memories  dated March 22, 2021 to strengthen PGN's  opinion.
With the additional 2 explanations, it is  hoped that 6 cases will be decided against the  DGT PK.
With the rejection of the DGT PK, it will  be the basis for PK submissions for the 18 cases  previously decided.
We are sure that the Supreme  Court will grant the PK on 18 cases because  based on empirical data based on the Supreme  Court website that all PK applications submitted  due to the Supreme Court's conflicting decisions  are always granted.
PGN has also submitted a fatwa request to the  Supreme Court to be able to determine the  PK decision granting the DGT PK application  is non-executable with the consideration that  the implementation of the PK decision is not  in line with the principle of tax collection, the  basic concept of VAT and will have a significant  impact not only for PGN that carries out  assignments from the Government of the Republic  of Indonesia, but also the multiplier effect  for national energy security and the national  economy.
Tax Dispute Case on Transfer of Participating  Interest  SEI had a tax dispute over the transfer of  participating interest at the time of the acquisition  of the Pangkah block with the Directorate  General of Taxes (DJP).
Through the decision of  the Supreme Court Number 4003 / B / PK / Pjk /  2019 dated 28 October 2019, it was stated that  if the Supreme Court granted the request for a  Review (PK) of the Directorate General of Taxes  which resulted in SEI still having to pay taxes  worth USD127,720,367, 46 along with fines.

Implementation of the Minister of EMR 89K /  2020 & 91/2020  The government through the Minister of Energy  and Mineral Resources Decree 89K / 2020  and Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources  91/2020 regulates the selling price of natural  gas to certain industrial customers.

Adjustments Made by the Company  Regarding tax disputes, the Company prioritizes  settlement measures in accordance with applicable  laws.
The company also coordinates with relevant  stakeholders to resolve these tax issues.
In relation to the implementation of the Ministerial  Decree 89K / 2020 & 91/2020, the Company has  adjusted the selling price to customers listed in the  attachment to the Ministerial Decree.
In addition, due to the impact of Covid-19, pressure  on the Rupiah exchange rate against USD, and the  decline in global oil prices, the Company made  adjustments to the 2020 Corporate Work Plan and INFORMASI KELANGSUNGAN USAHA Information on Business Continuity  Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Annual Report 2020 201 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN Management Discussion and AnalysisManagement Discussion and AnalysisAnggaran Perusahaan 2020.
Adjustments were made to the assumptions  used, revenue-forming factors and cost efficiency. 3.
Assumptions used by management in conducting the  assessment.
The assessment is based on the assumptions  outlined in the 2020 Revised PGN RKAP which  refers to the Revised APBN where adjustments  are made to the exchange rate assumption from  Rp14,400 / 1 USDto Rp15,000 / 1 USD.
The Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) assumption is  to be USD40 / barrel from the previous USD63 /  barrel, this is influenced by world oil prices which  tend to weaken due to a decrease in world oil  demand due to the pressure of Covid-19.
The commercial assumption of natural gas sales in  2020 is adjusted to 814 BBTUD from the previous  982 BBTUD.
This change was due to a decrease in  demand due to the impact of Covid-19 4.
Assessment and management decisions on these  influences a.
Management conducts risk assessments on matters  that have the potential to have a significant  impact on PGN's business continuity.
