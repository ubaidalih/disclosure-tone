Amidst  the ongoing economic challenges, up to December 2022,  CASA funds grew by 10.4%, or Rp79.7 trillion, accounting  for 81.9% of total third-party funds.

This is supported by strong CASA performance  in 2022.

These  committees meet regularly to discuss and provide input  and recommendations to the Board of Commissioners and  the Board of Directors.
The Bank also conducts regular evaluations on the  following: • Applicable policies and methodologies for risk  assessments • Adequacy of policies, procedures, and determination  of risk limits • Adequacy of identification, measurement,  monitoring, and mitigation of risks • Effectiveness of a comprehensive internal control  system.
Evaluation and updating of policies, procedures and  methodologies are conducted regularly to ensure  compliance with applicable regulations and operational  conditions.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of risk  management is also conducted through regular reports  submitted to the Board of Commissioners and the Board of  Directors.
These reports include a Risk Management Policy  Implementation Report, Risk Profile Report, Risk Update,  and other related reports.
Implementation of Basel Accords The Bank continues to prepare for the implementation  of the Basel Accords in Indonesia and participates in  supporting the implementation of Basel III, both in capital and liquidity, such as through the Quantitative Impact  Study (QIS).
BCA participates in the implementation of QIS  on capital position, Leverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding  Ratio (NSFR), Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Operational  Risk.
Risk Appetite The Bank defines risk appetite as the level and type of risks  which the Bank is willing to take to achieve its business  objectives.
The risk appetite set by BCA is reflected in the  Bank’s business strategies and objectives.
Stress Test BCA continually and regularly performs stress testing  under a variety of scenarios and consistently deepens  the factors and parameters of these tests.
Stress test  scenarios consider macroeconomic variables such as  interest rates, inflation rates, gross domestic product  (GDP), exchange rates, fuel prices and others.
The  methodology used in conducting stress tests, in addition  to statistical models based on historical data, also employs  judgment methods that consider qualitative risk factors.
Stress testing is carried out to see the impact of changes  in macroeconomic factors on various key indicators,  including the NPL, profitability, liquidity, and capital.
The results of the Bank’s stress testing for credit, market,  and liquidity risks have been satisfactory, while the capital  and liquidity of the Bank are sufficient to anticipate  estimated potential losses based on the built-in scenarios.
Additional to these Bank-only stress tests, BCA has  conducted an integrated stress test that includes its  subsidiaries.
BCA Capital Capital Structure  BCA’s capital structure consists of the following: 1.
Core capital (Tier 1) accounting for 96.3% of total capital at Rp212.4 trillion, up 8.3% from the previous year.  2.
Meanwhile, 3.7% of BCA’s total capital, or Rp8.1 trillion, is supplementary capital (Tier 2).
Supplementary capital  consists mainly of general reserves for Allowance of Asset Quality Assessment (PPKA).
Capital Component (consolidated - in billion Rupiah) 2022  2021  2020 Capital 220,568  203,621  186,953  Tier 1 Capital 212,446  196,114  179,945  Tier 2 Capital 8,123  7,507  7,008  Risk Weighted Assets (Credit, Operational and Market Risk)821,723 758,289 695,144 Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) - consolidated 26.8% 26.9% 26.9% Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) - non consolidated 25.8% 25.7% 25.8% 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 148 Management Discussion and AnalysisManagement Policy on Capital Structure BCA ensures an adequate capital position to support the  business development of the Bank and its subsidiaries.
The Bank’s capital adequacy is calculated using the  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) indicator.
BCA has an  adequate capital level with a CAR of 25.8%, above the  minimum requirement according to the risk profile, plus  an additional 2.5% as a buffer.
BCA has formed this buffer  in accordance with Bank Indonesia regulations regarding  systemic bank compliance to fulfill a conservation buffer,  a countercyclical buffer, and a capital surcharge.
The Bank and all its subsidiaries have carried out integrated  stress tests using various scenarios including various  changes to NPL levels and their effects on income, liquidity  position and capital position.
In general, the stress tests  results show that the liquidity and capital positions of BCA  and subsidiaries are adequate in anticipating losses from  potential risks, based on the tested scenarios.
BCA capital requirements can be fully met from its healthy  financial performance.
Most of the Bank’s net profit is  retained to increase its capital each year.
Basis for Management Policy on Capital Structure   BCA’s capital policy is regularly adjusted with reference  to business potential and the application of the prudential  principle.
Regarding the provisions of the Financial  Services Authority (OJK), the Board of Directors prepares  a capital plan as part of the Bank’s Business Plan and  obtains the approval of the Board of Commissioners.
The capital structure policy refers to OJK Regulation  No.11/POJK.03/2016 dated 2 February 2016 and No. 34/ POJK.03/2016 dated 26 September 2016 on the Minimum  Capital Requirement for Commercial Banks.
Disclosure of Risk Exposure and  Implementation of Risk Management The following is an overview of the risk exposures faced by  BCA in conducting its business and the application of risk  management designed to minimize the impact of these  risks.
Disclosure of Credit Risk Exposure and  Implementation of Credit Risk Management  Organization of Credit Risk Management BCA has developed a structured credit risk management  process to support strong credit principles with strong  internal controls: 1.
The Board of Commissioners, responsible for  approving the Bank’s credit plans and overseeing its  implementation, approving the Bank’s Credit Basic  Policy, and requesting an explanation from the Board  of Directors should there be any deviations in loan  disbursement from the stipulated policies.   2.
The Board of Directors, responsible for preparing  the credit plans and credit policy, ensuring the  Bank’s compliance with the prevailing regulations  on credit and credit policy, and reporting to the  Board of Commissioners on matters such as the  implementation of credit plans, irregularities in loan  disbursement, loan portfolio quality, and credit in  the special mention or in the non-performing loan  category. 3.
Chief	Risk	Officer, a BCA director responsible for  the management of credit, market, operational, and  other risks within the Bank’s organization (hereinafter  referred as Risk Management Director). 4.
Work units that perform functions related to  credit risk management (Business Units performing  credit disbursement activities and the Credit Risk  Analyst Unit), as the risk owner responsible for the  management of credit risk.
The Bank has dedicated committees assisting the Board of  Directors in the lending process:  1.
Credit Policy Committee  The main function is assisting the Board of Directors in  formulating credit policies, especially those relating  to the prudential principle in lending, monitoring, and  evaluating the implementation of credit policies,  conducting periodic reviews of the Bank’s Credit  Basic Policy (KDPB), monitoring the credit portfolio’s  progress and condition, and providing suggestions  and corrective measures based on the results of  evaluations.  2.
Credit Committee  The main function is providing guidance should a  more in-depth and comprehensive credit analysis  need to be performed, suggesting decisions or  recommendations on the draft of credit decisions  related to key debtors, specific industries or at  the specific request of the Board of Directors, as  well as coordinating with the Assets and Liabilities  Committee (ALCO) in terms of funding for credit and  adjustment of corporate lending rates.   3.
Risk Management Committee  The main function is developing policies, strategies,  and guidelines for risk management implementation,  determining matters related to irregular business  decisions, and enhancing the implementation  of risk management based on evaluation of the  effectiveness of the risk management process and  system.   2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 149  Financial Highlights  Management Report  Corporate Profile  Management Discussion and Analysis  Corporate Governance   Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment   Consolidated Financial Statements Risk Management Strategies for Activities with  Significant	Credit	Risk	Exposures		 Risk management strategies are formulated in accordance  with the overall business strategy and based on risk  appetite and risk tolerance.
Risk management strategies  are designed to ensure that BCA’s risk exposure is  prudently managed in line with its credit policy, BCA’s  internal procedures, laws and regulations, and other  applicable provisions.
BCA has designed a structured risk management strategy  based on the following general principles:   • Risk management strategies should be long-term and  oriented for the sustainability of BCA’s business by  considering economic conditions and cycles • A comprehensive risk management strategy must be  able to control and manage the risks of BCA and its  subsidiaries • Maintaining expected capital adequacy and  allocating adequate resources to support the  implementation of risk management.
The factors considered in designing risk management  strategies are as follows: • Economic and business development and the  potential impacts of risks faced by BCA • The organizational structure of BCA, including the  adequacy of human resources and supporting  infrastructure • The financial condition of BCA, including its ability  to generate earnings and the ability to manage risks  arising from both external and internal factors • The composition and diversification of BCA’s  portfolio.
Credit Concentration Risk Management Policy   Portfolio management addresses credit concentration risk  by determining limits for, amongst others, the industrial  sector, foreign exchanges, and certain types of loans,  as well as both individual and business group exposures.
Along with the development of a rating database,  technology, human resources, the Bank’s complexity  level, and the market and regulations, the Bank’s portfolio  management unit actively works to optimize the allocation  of the Bank’s capital to achieve an acceptable level in line  with risk appetite and risk tolerance.
Credit Risk Measurement and Control   BCA measures credit risk using a standardized method  that is compliant with OJK Circular Letter No. 42/ SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Guidelines for Calculating  Risk Weighted Assets Using a Standardized Approach.
The regulation specifies that all banks must use RWA  calculation for credit risk using a Standardized Approach.
For internal needs, the Bank uses an internal rating as a  supporting tool in the credit decision-making process.
Credit risk management is executed by establishing an  independent internal credit review for an effective credit  risk management process, covering:  • Evaluation of the credit administration process   • Assessment of the accuracy in the implementation  of internal risk rating and the use of other monitoring  tools • Effectiveness of work units and Bank officers  responsible for monitoring individual credit quality.
The Bank uses an early detection system to identify non- performing or potential non-performing loans to ensure it  can take proactive steps in managing the loan portfolio in  order to minimize the impact of non-performing loans on  the overall portfolio.
Forward Looking Information  In calculating expected credit losses, the Bank considers  the macroeconomic forecast.
In addition, the Bank also  determines a weighted probability for the possibility of  macro scenarios.
Various macroeconomic variables (MEV)  are used in modeling PSAK 71 depending on the results  of statistical analysis of the suitability of the MEV with  historical data for modeling impairment.
The calculation of  the expected credit loss and the macroeconomic forecast  is reviewed by the Bank periodically.
Policies Related to Wrong Way Risk Exposure   To anticipate wrong way risk exposures due to market  prices progressing in an adverse direction, BCA adds a  capital charge for the weighted exposure of the Credit  Valuation Adjustment (CVA risk weighted assets) in  accordance with SEOJK No.42/SEOJK.03/2016.
The Impact on the Value of Provided Collateral for A  Credit Downgrade  Collateral as a credit guarantee is differentiated between  productive credit and consumer credit.
For productive  loans such as SME, Commercial and Corporate, the  collateral impact (type, value and/or quality) will affect the  credit rating in terms of the exposure risk factor (not the  customer risk factor), so that the better the collateral can  reduce the risk of exposure (the rating exposure risk factor  has improved).
For consumer loans such as Mortgage, the impact of  collateral value will directly affect the credit rating of  the debtor.
Hence, the higher collateral value, the better  credit rating improvement will be.  2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 150 Management Discussion and AnalysisStandardized Approach to the Implementation of Credit  Risk Measurement  In the calculation of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) for  credit risk, the Bank refers to OJK Circular Letter No.42/  SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Guidelines for the Calculation of  Risk Weighted Assets by using the Standardized Approach  for Credit Risk, OJK Circular Letter No.48/SEOJK.03/2017  and OJK Circular Letter No.11/SEOJK.03/2018.
RWA for credit risk uses Basel II standardized approach,  and is calculated based on the rating results issued by  rating agencies recognized by OJK according to OJK  Circular Letter No. 37/SEOJK.03/2016 regarding Rating  Agencies and Ratings Recognized by OJK.
The use of ratings in the calculation of RWA credit risk  is only for claims on Governments of Other Countries,  Public Sector Entities, Multilateral Development Banks and  particular International Institutions, Banks, and Corporates.
Counterparty credit risk arises from Over the Counter  (OTC) derivative transactions and repo/reserve repo  transactions, both on the trading book and the banking  book.
The standardized approach is used to calculate  credit risk of capital adequacy ratio for any exposures that  cause counterparty credit risk.
Determination of credit limits related to counterparty  credit risks can be adjusted according to the needs of  the counterparty, the Bank’s risk appetite, and any other applicable regulations, such as POJK No.32/POJK.03/2018  and POJK No.38/POJK.03/2019 regarding Maximum  Lending Limits and Large Fund Provisions for Commercial  Banks.
Credit Risk Mitigation The preferred type of collateral accepted to mitigate  credit risk is solid collateral deemed as cash or land and  buildings.
These types of collateral have relatively high  liquidity value and/or can be legally attached so that  the Bank is able to liquidate collateral immediately if the  debtor’s/debtor group’s loan becomes delinquent.
Collateral assessment for loans is performed by an  independent appraiser.
In remote areas where no  independent appraiser is available, the appraisal will be  conducted by internal staff who are not involved in the  processing of the loan.
To monitor the physical collateral  pledged to BCA by the debtor, site visits are conducted  periodically to review the status of the collateral.
The main guarantors/warrant providers are analyzed when  processing credit and creditworthiness is determined by  applying the “Four Eyes” principle, where credit decisions  are determined by two independent parties, the Business  Development Unit and the Credit Risk Analysis Unit.
The credit mitigation technique focuses on primary  collateral.
In addition, to mitigate possible credit risks,  BCA’s loan portfolio is well diversified, both in credit  category and by industry/economic sector.
Disclosure of Market Risk Exposure and Implementation of Market Risk Management  Market Risk Management Organization  The Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors are responsible for ensuring that the implementation of risk  management with regard to exchange rates and interest rates is in line with the Bank’s strategic direction, scale, and  business characteristics as well as exchange rate and interest rate risk profiles.
This includes ensuring the integration of  exchange rate and interest rate risk management with other risks that may affect the Bank’s risk position.
The Board of Directors delegates its authority and responsibility to the parties listed below:  Party  Authority and Responsibility ALCO Determines policies and strategies regarding foreign exchange and interest rates.
Risk Management Work Unit Supports ALCO in monitoring and measuring foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Treasury Division Manages the Bank’s overall operations in foreign currency transactions and interest rates  on the trading book:   - Responsible for maintaining foreign currency Net Open Position (NOP) and mitigating  interest rates on the trading book and ensuring the Bank’s compliance with Bank  Indonesia regulations regarding NOP.
-  Responsible for managing trading marketable securities and foreign currency  transactions in line with customer needs and/or income considerations.
Regional	Offices	and	Branches Manages foreign currency transactions in the respective regional offices/branches in  accordance with predetermined limits.
All regional/branch foreign currency transactions  are covered by the Treasury Division.
Limits for each region/branch are determined in  accordance with operational needs.  2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 151  Financial Highlights  Management Report  Corporate Profile  Management Discussion and Analysis  Corporate Governance   Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment   Consolidated Financial Statements The calculation of market risk for BCA’s capital  requirements uses the standard method of the OJK.
Trading Book and Banking Book Portfolio Management  Management of portfolios exposed to interest rate risk  (on the trading book) and to foreign exchange risk is  conducted by setting and monitoring the use of Nominal  Limits (Securities, Net Open Position), Value at Risk Limits  (VAR), and Stop Loss Limits.
The valuation method is  based on closeout prices or market price quotations from  independent sources, including the following:  • Indonesia Bond Pricing Agency (IBPA)   • Bloomberg Generic & Value (BGN & VAL)   • Exchange prices • Dealer screen prices • The most conservative prices quoted by at least two  brokers and/or market makers • The yield curve, in the even that market prices from  independent sources are not available.
Market Risk Measurement   For monitoring market risk (exchange rates and interest  rates) daily, Value at Risk measurements are taken based on  a full valuation historical method using a 250-day window  of data at a 99% confidence level.
For the calculation of  minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), market risk is  calculated based on the standardized method set by OJK.
Scope of Trading and Banking Book Portfolios Accounted  for in Capital Adequacy Ratio  The following is the scope of the portfolio coverage  included in the CAR calculations:  • Exchange rate risk covers both the trading and  banking books.
Exchange rate risks can arise  from foreign exchange transactions Today (TOD),  Tomorrow (TOM), Spot, Forward, Swap, Domestic  Non-Delivery Forward (DNDF) and Option (Structured  Product) • Interest rate risk covers the trading book.
It can arise  from securities, Forward, and Swap transactions • Equity risk (for subsidiaries) considers the trading  book.
It can arise from equity trading transactions  that may be carried out by subsidiaries.
Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB)  Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB) occurs as a result  of movements in the market interest rate that are against  the Bank’s position or transactions, and which may affect  both the Bank’s interest income and the economic capital  value.
In performing IRRBB measurement, the Bank uses  a gap report (repricing gap) that measures assets and  liabilities that are interest rate sensitive in nature to be  mapped within a certain period.
Mapping is conducted based on the remaining maturity  date for any instrument with a fixed interest rate or on  the remaining time up to the next interest rate adjustment  for any instrument with a floating rate.
The Bank uses  an earning approach and economic value approach to  measure interest rate risk.
Monitoring and measurement  of interest rate risk exposure on the banking book is  submitted to the Board of Directors/ALCO on a monthly  basis.

Mechanism to Identify and Measure Operational Risk The Bank has owned and implemented the Risk Self- Assessment (RSA) methodology to identify and measure  operational risks since 2002, which has been improved  into Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA).
RCSA has  been implemented in all work units at branches and head  office that are identified as having significant operational  risks.
In RCSA methodology, work units at branches and head  office identify and measure operational risks inherent  to their work units, determine the controls that must be  implemented to mitigate risks, then design follow-up  action plans should there be residual risk with significant  value.
In addition to the RSCA methodology, the Bank has  implemented a Loss Event Database (LED) and Key Risk  Indicator (KRI).
LED is designed to assist the Bank in  monitoring, recording, and analyzing operational events  that have occurred and could lead to losses so that the  Bank can take corrective and preventive actions to  minimize the possible risk of operational losses.
LED is also a means of operational risk loss data collection  used by the Bank to determine the allocation of capital  charge from operational losses using the Standardized  Approach.
Currently, LED has been implemented in all  regional offices, branches, and work units at head office.
KRI is a method used to provide an early warning signal  in the event of increased operational risk within a work  unit.
All regional offices, branches, and work units at head  office are considered to have fairly significant operational  risks and have implemented KRI.
The KRI system has been  further developed into a predictive risk management tool  that can detect and respond to increased risks within work  units.
The implementation of RCSA, LED and KRI methodologies  is supported by the Operational Risk Management  Information System (ORMIS).

The Group measures fair values using the following hierarchy of methods: • Level 1: inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments that the Group can access at the  measurement date; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Disclosure of Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB) Exposure - Bank as Individual - as of December 31, 2022 No.
Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) refers to the current or prospective risk to the bank’s capital and earnings arising from  interest rates movements in the market as opposed to the banking book positions.
The IRRBB calculation uses two perspectives,  namely the economic value perspective and earnings-based perspective.
The intention is to identify risks more accurately and to  carry out appropriate corrective actions.  2.
Presently, Bank does not have sufficient long-term financial resources to fund fixed-rate loans and banking book securities.
Regarding these conditions, funding sources of fixed-rate loans and banking book securities is calculated from the Core Deposit.
To mitigate risks, Bank has set nominal limits on fixed-rate loans and banking book securities, limits on IRRBB and pricing  strategies.  3.
Measurements of IRRBB individual are carried out on a monthly basis by using two (2) methods as follows: a.
measurement based on changes in economic value of equity, which measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the  economic value of the Bank’s equity (economic value perspective), and b.
measurement based on changes in net interest income, which measures the impact of interest rate changes on earnings of the  Bank (earnings-based perspective). 4.
Interest rate shock scenarios used by Bank in measuring IRRBB is in accordance with the standard interest rate shock scenarios,  which is stated in the Financial Services Authority Circular Letter No.12 /SEOJK.03/2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk  Management and Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks.
Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Methods use six (6) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up, 2)  parallel shock down, 3)  steepener shock (short rates down and long rates up), 4)  flattener shock (short rates up and long rates down), 5)  short rates shock up, 6)  short rates shock down.
Net Interest Income (NII) Methods use two (2) interest rate shock scenarios, as follows: 1)  parallel shock up, 2)  parallel shock down. 5.
EVE method calculates the cash flows of the principal amount and interest payments on the balance sheet positions that are  sensitive to interest rates, which then discounted at the relevant interest rates.
The Bank does not calculate a commercial margin and spread components in the cash flows.
EVE calculation uses notional  cash flows multiplied by the reference rate (base rate) on the transaction date and then discounted by the risk-free rate at the  reporting date.
The IRRBB calculation uses a Core deposit, which is part of a stable Non Maturity Deposit with a very small change in interest rates  despite significant changes in interest rates in the market.
Bank identifies core deposit and non-core deposits from stable funds (retail transactional, retail non-transactional and wholesale).
Placement of core deposit cash flows carried out using uniform slotting on time-bucket over 1 (one) year with the length of period  for each category refers to FSA Circular Letter No. 12/SEOJK.03/2018 concerning the Implementation of Risk Management  and Risk Measurement Standard Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) for  Commercial Banks.
The methodology to estimate prepayment rate for loans and early withdrawal rate for time deposits uses historical data within a  year.
Bank performs add-on calculations for automatic interest rate options on a floating rate mortgage loan with embedded caps and  a fixed rate loan commitment by using Black model.
Bank measures IRRBB for significant currencies, IDR and USD.
In total IRRBB, the maximum negative (absolute) value of the two  currencies is aggregated. 6.
As of December 31, 2022, IRRBB (EVE method) for BCA as individual increased by 0.21% compared to June 30, 2022, from 8.92%  to 9.13%.
And for NII Method increased by 1.62%, from 8.09% to 9.71%.
This was caused by the increase in Repriced Assets over 1  year (11.98%), and the decrease in Core Deposit over 1 year (1.32%).
Meanwhile, Tier 1 Capital increase by 9.56%.

Meanwhile the calculation for Quarter III 2022 is based on the average daily position data from  July 2022 to September 2022.
•  BCA's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (Bank Only) during Quarter IV 2022 decreased by 13.62%; from 407.11% (Quarter III 2022) to  393.49% (Quarter IV 2022).
The decrease in this ratio was mainly due to the increase in Net Cash Outflow after the run-off by  5.49% (Rp6.87 trillion) which was higher than the increase in the weighted value of HQLA of 1.96% (Rp 9.98 trillion).
The increase  in NCO after the run-off was mainly due to an increase in funding from individuals, micro and small businesses, as well as  corporations for the amount of Rp3.01 trillion, an increase in other contractual cash outflows (ex: dividends and borrowing) for the  amount of Rp1.60 trillion , and an increase in bills due ≤ 30 days for the amount of Rp0.82 trillion.
Meanwhile, the increase in HQLA  was particularly due to an increase in securities with HQLA for the amount of Rp13.17 trillion, a decrease in placement at BI for the  amount of Rp3.56 trillion, and an increase in Cash for the amount of Rp0.15 trillion.
•  The composition of BCA's HQLA in Quarter IV 2022 consists of Level 1 HQLA of 98,38%; Level 2A HQLA of 1.18%; and Level  2B HQLA of 0.44%.
The composition of the amount of HQLA Level 1 was dominated by Marketable Securities issued by the  Indonesian Government and BI of 72.78% and Placement at Bank Indonesia of 23.49%.

The increase in NCO  after the run-off is mainly due to an increase in funding from individuals, micro and small businesses, as well as corporations for  the amount of Rp3.29 trillion, an increase in other contractual cash outflows (ex: dividends and borrowing) for the amount of  Rp1.78 trillion , and an increase in bills due ≤ 30 days for the amount of Rp0.98 trillion.
Meanwhile, the increase in HQLA is mainly  due to an increase in securities with HQLA for the amount of Rp14.43 trillion, a decrease in BI placements for the amount of   Rp4.18 trillion, and an increase in Cash for the amount of Rp0.16 trillion.

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON NSFR Analysis on Bank Only Financial Statement •  Based on the calculation, the value of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) - Individual as of 31 December 2022 decreased by 3.40%  when compared to the period of 30 Sep 2022; from 172.63% (30 September 2022) to 169.23% (31 December 2022).
The decrease  in NSFR value is due to the increase in the Required Stable Funding (RSF) component of 4.02% (Rp24.76 trillion) which is greater  than the increase in the Available Stable Funding (ASF) component by 1.97% (Rp20.96 trillion) .
The increase in the RSF component  was mainly due to an increase in loans with current and special attention (performing) categories and securities amounting to  Rp21.97 trillion and an increase in other assets amounting to Rp3.58 trillion.
Meanwhile, the increase in the ASF component was  mainly due to an increase in the weighted value savings from individual customers, micro business and small business as well as  funding from corporate customers amounting to Rp11.40 trillion and an increase in KPMM amounting to Rp9.47 trillion.
• The NSFR ratio of BCA on an individual basis currently meets the minimum requirement of 100%.
This was supported by a fairly  large composition of stable funds (56.54%).

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON NSFR Analysis on Consolidated Financial Statement •  Based on the calculation, the value of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) - Consolidated per 31 December 2022 decreased by 2.78%  when compared to the period of 30 September 2022; namely from 173.90% (30 September 2022) to 171.12% (31 December 2022).
The NSFR value decreased due to the increase in the Required Stable Funding (RSF) component of 3.70% (Rp23.01 trillion) which  was greater than the increase in the Available Stable Funding (ASF) component of 2.04% (Rp22.10 trillion).
The increase in the  RSF component is mainly due to an increase in loans with current and special attention (performing) categories and securities  amounting to Rp22.73 trillion and an increase in other assets amounting to Rp0.87 trillion.
Meanwhile, the increase in the ASF  component is mainly due to an increase in the weighted value deposit from individual customers, micro businesses and small  businesses as well as wholesale funding of Rp12.64 trillion and an increase in Regulatory Capital of Rp9.36 trillion.

BCA has a risk management policy, including an operational risk management policy, along with provisions, procedures and  manuals that are derived from the operational risk management policy.
These policies, provisions and procedures/manuals are  reviewed periodically to comply with applicable regulatory provisions, the directions of the Basel Accord, prudential banking  principle, and other international best practices.
Here are some of the policies that the bank has in place: •  Basic Risk Management Policy.
•  Operational Risk Management Policy.
•  Basic Information Technology Usage Risk Management Policy.
•  Information Security Policy.
•  Product/Activity Publishing Policy and Provision of Supporting Information Technology Systems.
•  Evaluation on Increased Risk Exposure of Bank Product Development Policy.
•  Business Continuity Plan Policy.
The development of policies related to risk management, including strategy, risk management framework, and risk limits as a  whole, is included under the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors.
The policy is compiled with consideration to  risk appetite and risk tolerance according to the Bank's needs/conditions and taking into account the impact of risk on capital  adequacy.
The determination of policies, strategies, and risk management framework by the Board of Directors is done after  obtaining approval from the Board of Commissioners.
These policies, provisions, and procedures/manuals are documented and complied into a digital work guide (PAKAR) that can be  accessed by all employees (using their USER ID).
The Bank conducts regular reviews and assessments of the adequacy of controls  on policies, provisions, procedures/manual operation to ensure that operational risks have been properly mitigated. 2 Explanation of the structure and organization of management and control functions related to Operational Risk.
In managing operational risk, the Bank refers to the 3 lines of defense principle with the following organizational tools: Organizational Tools Authority/Responsibility Board of Commissioners and  DirectorsEnsuring that the application of risk management is adequate in accordance with the Bank's  characteristics, complexity, and risk profile, as well as a good understanding of the type and level  of risk attached to the Bank's business activities.
Risk Management Committee Ensuring that the risk management framework provides adequate protection against the risks  faced by the Bank, among others by compiling policies, strategies, and guidelines for risk  management.
Risk Oversight Committee Assisting the Board of Commissioners in ensuring that the risk management framework has  provided adequate protection against all risks facing the Financial Conglomerate.
The Risk  Oversight Committee is also in charge of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the  duties of the Risk Management Committee and the Risk Management Work Unit.
Risk Management Work Unit  (SKMR)Ensuring the Bank properly mitigates risk through identification, measurement, monitoring,  control, and reporting in accordance with the risk management framework and is able to face  emergency situations that threaten the continuity of the Bank's business.

Work Unit (business unit and  supporting unit)Risk owner who is responsible for day-to-day operational risk management and reports problems  and operational risk incidents to SKMR. 3 Explanation of the measurement system for Operational Risk (covering the system and data used to calculate Operational Risk  in order to estimate the capital burden for Operational Risk).
Operational risk measurement aims to obtain an overview of the Bank's operational risk profile in order to prioritise mitigation  actions in relation to existing risks.
Operational risk is measured by gauging the magnitude of the impact and the level of risk  occurrence, as well as the level of control strength applied to the Bank's business processes and operational activities.
The  operational risk measurement system is evaluated periodically or when necessary to ensure the appropriateness of assumptions,  accuracy, reasonableness, and data integrity, as well as the procedures used to measure operational risk.
In calculating the capital burden for operational risk, as of January 2023, the Bank refers to SE OJK No. 6/SEOJK.03/2020 regarding  the Calculation of Weighted Assets According to Risk for Operational Risk by Using the Standard Approach for Commercial Banks  (SE OJK RWA).
In order for the Bank to be able to estimate the capital burden that suits the operational loss exposure experienced  by the Bank, the collection of quality operational risk incident data is crucial.
Therefore, it owns procedures and processes for the  identification, collection, and treatment of operational risk loss data as outlined in the provisions and manual of the Operational  Risk Management Information System (ORMIS) - Loss Event Database (LED). 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 260 Management Discussion and Analysis Risk Management Implementation Report for Operational Risk  - Individual In addition, to assist operational risk management in work units, the Bank has a supporting infrastructure in the form of ORMIS,  which can support three activities, namely: •	Risk and Control Self Assessment (RCSA)  RCSA is a means for work units to perform the operational risk identification process attached to their work units, carry out risk  measurement based on the impact and likelihood of occurrence, determine the controls that should be set in order to mitigate  the risk, then develop an action plan to follow up when there is a residual risk of a significant value.
RCSA is performed yearly.
• Loss Event Database (LED)  LED is used to record and analyze operational events that cause losses for the Bank.
With the presence of LED, the Bank can  take corrective and preventive actions.
LED is also a tool used by the Bank as an operational loss database to calculate the  simulation of capital burden from operational risk losses using the Standard Approach method.
In order to obtain quality data, in  the recording of operational losses on applications by a work unit, there is a dual control mechanism with the roles of data entry  and approver.
The Bank has internal regulations governing the input of loss data in order to meet the qualitative requirements  set by SE OJK RWA.
• Key Risk Indicator (KRI)  KRI aims to provide an indicator / early warning sign of the possible occurrence of or increase in operational risk in a work  unit, in the form of an e-mail notification to the authorized officer.
Based on the notification, the authorities are expected to  immediately carry out the necessary actions to minimize the risk that may occur. 4Explanation	of	the	scope	of	the	report	framework	for	Operational	Risk	for	the	Bank's	executive	officers	and	directors.
In terms of the Board of Commissioners and Directors active supervision on operational risk, reporting is presented as follows: 1.
Routine (periodic) reports: • Financial Conglomerate Operational Risk Exposure Report.
• Integrated Operational Risk Profile Report.
• Integrated Operational Risk Management Implementation Report. 2.
Incidental reports:  Reports on the results of analysis of operational incidents and incidental policy changes, systems and procedures.
This report  can be in the form of an analysis report on the Bank's operational procedures and systems in relation to internal or external  operational incidents of the Bank that have significant operational losses. 5 Explanation of risk mitigation and risk transfer used in the management of Operational Risk.
This covers mitigation by issuing  policies (such as policies for risk culture, acceptable risk, and outsourcing), by divesting high-risk businesses, and by establishing  a control function.
Remaining exposure can be absorbed by the Bank or risk transfered.
For example, the impact of operational  losses can be mitigated with insurance.
The principles of risk management, including for operational risk, cover the following 4 pillars: 1.
Active Supervision of the Board of Commissioners and Directors. 2.
Adequacy of the Risk Management Policies and Procedures and Risk Limits. 3.
Adequacy of the Risk Identification, Measurement, Monitoring, and Handling Process, as well as Risk Management Information  System. 4.
Comprehensive Internal Control System    The Bank compiles policies, internal regulations, systems and procedures related to operational risk management as a foundation  for implementing operational risk management, as well as in the context of mitigating risks, both expected and unexpected.
In  formulating policies, the Bank pays attention to risk management strategies, risk appetite and risk tolerance, existing policies and  procedures, as well as risk limits.
The Bank internalizes the implementation of operational risk management to all business lines  and supporters to ensure the adequacy of operational procedures and controls.
The Bank nurtures a culture of awareness on the  importance of operational risk management on an ongoing basis, through education for each level of department as well as the  Risk Awareness Program.
In general, the scope of operational risk management policies based on the emergent causes of operational risk are as follows: Risk Cause Operational Risk Management Policy Coverage Internal Process Complexity 1.
Controls to prevent the occurrence of operational risks either for all internal processes or  those directly related to customers. 2.
Transaction settlement procedures from internal processes, such as to ensure the  effectiveness of the transaction settlement process. 3.
Accounting implementation procedures to ensure accurate accounting records, including  the appropriateness of accounting methods, accounting processes, and administration of  supporting documents. 4.
Asset storage and custodial procedures, including documentation, handling required for the  physical security of assets, and regular checks on the condition of assets. 5.
Implementation procedures for the products procurement and other activities performed by  the Bank. 6.
Fraud prevention and resolution procedures.
Human Resources Recruitment and placement according to the organization’s needs, competitive remuneration  and incentive structures, training and development, periodic rotation, career planning and  succession policies, handling issues of employment termination and unions, as well as separation  of work functions. 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 261  Financial Highlights  Management Report  Corporate Profile  Management Discussion and Analysis  Corporate Governance   Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment   Consolidated Financial Statements Risk Management Implementation Report for Operational Risk  - Individual Risk Cause Operational Risk Management Policy Coverage Systems and infrastructure Access procedures such as in information management systems, accounting information  systems, risk management systems, and security in the dealing room, and data processing room.
External events IInsurance coverage, data/system back-up, work safety guarantees, physical security  procedures, and cooperation agreements with third parties.
Operational risk of customer  and prospective customer  profilesBanks perform Customer Due Diligence (CDD) or Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) in accordance  with operational risk exposure.
The Bank has a procedure that is a derivative of the operational risk management policy of general control and specific control.
When there are changes in the Bank's operational activities, the Operation Strategy & Development Group together with SKMR  and related units review and evaluate to ensure that risks arising from those activities have been properly reduced.
In order to minimize the impact of disruption and damage from natural or human disasters that can affect the Bank's business  operations, especially customer service, the Bank has in place Business Continuity Management (BCM).
In order for BCM to run  effectively, the Bank has created a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to facilitate the Bank in preparing for disruptions and in the  recovery process, which includes a crisis management plan, crisis communication, as well as routinely socializing BCP awareness  and testing the BCP, including through cyber incidents simulations.
Moreover, the Bank also has formed a Disaster Recovery Center integrated with two Data Centers that operate in a mirroring  manner, a Secondary Operations Center, a Multi-Operation Site, and a Command and Crisis Center.
In the process of developing new products/activities, the Bank has created a process to ensure that new products/activities have  sufficient risk control or risk reduction so that they do not affect the Bank's risk profile significantly.
The management of new  products/activities implemented in the Bank covers several important aspects, such as: • Every new product/activity development plan must be approved by Directors and reported to the Board of Commissioners as  a form of supervision by the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners.
• Every new product/activity development plan needs to identify risks that may arise and their impact on all risks so that sufficient  risk reduction can be implemented.
• Each product/activity publication is carried out through several levels of study, such as the level of planning, development,  testing, implementation, and evaluation.
• New products/activities that have been implemented will be evaluated to ensure that the products/activities meet targets and  have adequate risk mitigation.
• There is an accounting information system for each new product and activity.
• information transparency to customers related to new products or activities that have been released.
Technology development and digitalization in banking presents the Bank with increasingly diverse challenges.
With digital  transformation, IT is used increasingly to support operational activities and the provision of services to customers.
In addition,  with the increasingly dynamic development of technology, the Bank has updated many systems to adopt new technology.
This of  course increases the risk for the Bank's operations so that the Bank needs to increase its maturity in the maintenance of IT and be  able to deal with risks that may arise from the use of IT.
To maintain security in digital banking transactions, the Bank implements cyber risk management with reference to the Bank's  strategy and the regulator's instructions.
Security related to digital transactions performed by the Bank includes the use of 2 Factor  Authentication (2FA), the use of OTP, restrictions with transaction limits, and transaction monitoring using a fraud detection system  (FDS).
To mitigate cyber risks, the Bank has procedures for handling information security incidents, an Information Security Incident  Response Team (ISIRT), and a Security Monitoring Center (SMC) that operates 24 hours a day.
In addition, the Bank also routinely  conducts security awareness socialization to employees and management in the form of e-learning, videos, infographics, and  e-mail phishing simulations.
Educational efforts are also carried out with customers regularly, delivered through: • BCA’s official website and social media accounts.
• Articles on the Bank's partner online media.
• Information at the branch through banners.
• Information provided when accessing the Bank's transaction channel.
Moreover, increases in service provision that prioritize personalization cause a high demand for customers' personal data.
This is  related to the development of open banking in the banking world.
Provisions regulating data privacy at BCA include: •  Consumer Protection Provisions, which regulate the principles and matters to be observed related to consumer protection,  including design, information provision, information delivery, and agreements drafting related to products and services.
•  Data Loss Prevention Manual, which regulates the protection of sensitive data/information owned by BCA from the threat of  theft/leakage.
To mitigate risks in the use of outsourced workforce, the Bank has provisions for Outsourcing Management that refer to regulatory  provisions.

Operational risk measurement aims to obtain an overall operational risk profile of potential risk inherent in the entire portfolio or  exposure of the Financial Conglomerate.
Operational risk is the risk due to inadequate and/or non-functioning internal processes,  human errors, system failures, and/or external events that affect the operations of the Financial Conglomerate.

BCA has conducted  a comprehensive analysis of the ongoing digitization  process and selectively developed its physical offices in potential growing areas with improved infrastructures.
Branch offices play an important role to provide ease of  access to in-person services, particularly for customers  that still demand human interactions.

The implementation of digital technology also  allows for more personal relationships to be developed  by interacting directly and frequently with customers  and the community, wherever they are.

All of these efforts in improving service  are supported by the monitoring dashboard, which allows  the bank to monitor service quality closely and to follow  up immediately if there are service problems.
Banking transaction services through branches and digital  channels are supported by Halo BCA as a solution service  center.
Halo BCA plays a key role in facilitating customers  to access online customer services, both in Indonesia  and abroad with Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP)  technology.

We are pleased with our  performance in assets, funding and profitability. 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 280 Management Discussion and Analysis Economy, Banking Sector and   BCA Financial Review 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 281  Financial Highlights  Management Report  Corporate Profile  Management Discussion and Analysis  Corporate Governance   Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment   Consolidated Financial Statements MACROECONOMIC REVIEW Economic recovery gathered pace in 2022, as the  COVID-19 pandemic transitioned into an endemic  state, while optimism returned among businesses and  consumers.
Unfortunately, the recovery was interrupted  by global turmoil, most notably the Russian invasion of  Ukraine which triggered a significant increase in global  energy and food prices.
High inflation in turn pushed central banks to tighten  monetary policy.
The US central bank, The Fed, increased  its benchmark rate by 425 bps in 2022, significantly  reducing global liquidity.
This, combined with higher  energy and food prices, depressed global growth, as seen  from the growth rates in the United States (US) (1.6%),  Eurozone (3.1%), Japan (1.7%) and China (3.2%).
Tight  money policy also weighed on financial assets, which  negatively impacted consumer and business confidence.
However, these global disruptions also benefited  Indonesia, as prices of staple commodity exports  skyrocketed.
Exports of coal, CPO, nickel derivatives, and  others grew strongly in 2022, such that Indonesia ended  the year with a record-high USD54.5 billion trade surplus.
Strong demand for commodities, especially related to  energy and electrification, also drove a record amount of  foreign direct investment (FDI), totaling USD30.0 billion in  the first three quarters of 2022.

This recovery  continued, even though its momentum slowed somewhat  following the increase in retail fuel prices in September.
The robust domestic demand keeps local industries  afloat amidst weakening global demand, with Purchasing  Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing still at 50.9 where  global PMI had slipped below 50 since August.
Strong growth, combined with the ballooning trade  balance, helped support the Rupiah during a period of  rapid appreciation of the US Dollar.
The Rupiah ended the  year at Rp15,564 against the USD, down by 8.34% year- on-year.
This is a modest depreciation compared to many  other emerging and hard currencies, for instance the  Indian Rupee (-10.0%), Japanese Yen (-13.91%), and the  Turkish Lira (-28.4%).
Inflation and BI 7-day (Reverse) Repo Rate (%) BI 7-day (Reverse) Repo Rate Source: Central Bureau of Statistics and Bank Indonesia The Rupiah’s value also held up relatively well against  goods and services in general, with moderate inflation  (5.51% YoY) despite the aforementioned fuel price  hike.
Price stability is further supported by prudent  monetary and fiscal policies, as well as judicious market  interventions to ensure the availability of key items such  as cooking oil, rice, and fertilizers. 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 282 Management Discussion and AnalysisBANKING SECTOR REVIEW IN 2022 Banking performance in 2022 demonstrated strong  performance, supported by rising loan demand resulted  from the gradual economic reopening and proactive  government moves to spur growth.
The government  regularly reviewed mobility restriction rules, striking the  balance between economic activities versus public health  perspective.
Mobility restriction was eased significantly  in late 2021, led to a strong rebound in commerce and  private consumption over the course of 2022.
Various regulator programs, including credit restructuring  relaxation by the Financial Services Authority (OJK), have  sustained the continuity of banking intermediary function.
BI’s prudent measures in adjusting BI 7-Day Reverse Repo  reference rate (BI-7DRR) are supportive to the economy  as we saw a manageable level of inflation and continued  monetary stability.
By December 2022, the BI-7DRR  stood at 5.50%, an increase of 200 bps from July 2022.
The policy rate adjustment was combined with other pro- growth macroprudential policies, including continued  relaxation of loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on consumer  loans, as well as incentives for banks to lend to small/ medium enterprises (SME) and certain priority sectors.
At the end of 2022 (Sep-22) banking industry loans  increased by 11.0% YoY to Rp6,275 trillion, with the highest  growth came from manufacture, mining, and trading.
The sector’s third party funds grew 6.8% YoY to Rp7,647  trillion.
Liquidity remained at an adequate level, with a  Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 82.4%.
In managing the  stability of liquidity, BI has adjusted the Rupiah Reserve  Requirement (RR) policy, from 3.5% in early 2022 to 9.0%  in September 2022.
OJK’s decision to extend the credit restructuring  relaxation policy period until March 2024 (POJK No. 17/ POJK.03/2021) from March 2023 was regarded as an  appropriate move to support banking industry in managing  credit quality.
The extension of the restructuring period  will be applicable to MSME borrowers, labor-intensive  industries such as textile and footwear, accommodation  and food & beverage sectors. 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 283  Financial Highlights  Management Report  Corporate Profile  Management Discussion and Analysis  Corporate Governance   Corporate Social Responsibility and Environment   Consolidated Financial Statements BCA FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OVERVIEW 2022 BCA and its subsidiaries posted a 29.6% growth in net  profit to Rp40.7 trillion, driven by an increase in net  interest income and non-interest income, as well as a  decrease in impairment losses on assets.

Broad-based loan growth was seen across  all segments, though corporate loans contributed almost  half of the volume growth.
By Sep-22, BCA’s loan market  share stood at 10.6%.
BCA’s loan quality continued to improve significantly, with  Loan at Risk (LAR) decreasing from 14.6% to 10.0%.

BCA’s  capital and liquidity remain solid as reflected in capital  adequacy ratio (CAR) of 25.8% and loan to deposit ratio  (LDR) of 65.2%.
On the funding side, current and savings accounts (CASA)  increased by 10.4% YoY.
The growth in CASA is supported  by continuous expansion of ecosystem and multi-channel  investments, which delivered higher customer base and  transaction volume.
Total third party funds amounted to  Rp1,030.5 trillion, an increase of 6.4% from the previous  year.
Strong loan expansion and solid CASA funding drove the  BCA’s net interest income growth.
Furthermore, higher  interest rate environment supported further interest  income yield.
BCA was able to maintain low cost of  funds due to its strong transaction banking performance.
Operating income other than interest rose 5.1% supported  by the growth of fee and commission income mainly from  payment settlement and credit related fees.
As of the end  of 2022, the return on assets (ROA) and return on equity  (ROE) were recorded at 3.2% and 21.7%, respectively, an  increase from the previous year’s achievement of 2.8%  and 18.3%.  8444,776 1,0307,647 6956,275 BCA and Banking Industry in 2022  (in trillion Rupiah) CASA Third Party Funds Loans Industry (Sep-22) BCA 1.7%2.8% 65.282.4% 25.8% 25.2% Financial Ratio Comparison of BCA and Banking Industry   in 2022 NPL LDR CAR Industry (Sep-22) BCA The following is the Management Discussion and Analysis  of BCA’s financial performance in 2022.

The increase in interest income was supported by the  growth in the volume of earning assets, especially loans  and Government bonds.
Overall earning asset yield  remained relatively flat at 6.05% in 2022 though we saw  an upward trend from the level of 5.7% in the first quarter  to reach 6.6% in the fourth quarter, depicting an opposite  trend compared to the previous year.
The increasing  yield trend throughout 2022 was driven by rising interest  rate on short term asset placement.
On the lending  side, interest rates were maintained on majority of loan  portfolio despite the rise in benchmark rate.
BCA focused  on growing loan volume over raising lending rates since  the debtors were still in the early stage of post-pandemic  recovery and were exposed to inflationary pressures.
Interest expense decreased by 13.1% in line with the  gradual reduction in the interest rate of third-party funds  in 2021 and early 2022.
This has resulted in the decline of  average cost of funds in 2022.
Cost of funds was 0.77%  for the year 2022, lower by 26 bps compared to the  previous year.
Time Deposit (Rupiah) cost of funds was  recorded at 1.90%, or reduced by 90 bps year-on-year  and one of the lowest in the industry.
CASA (Rupiah) cost  of funds declined by 10 bps, reaching 30 bps by the end of  the year, compared to 40 bps from previous year.
With a more optimized asset mix in 2022 and higher  interest rate on short term asset placement, the Net  Interest Margin (NIM) showed a consistent upward trend  in every quarter.
NIM increased from 4.9% in the first  quarter to 5.9% in the last quarter.
Annual NIM reached  5.3%, higher compared to 5.1% in 2021. 2022 Annual Report PT Bank Central Asia Tbk 294 Management Discussion and Analysis 2022 2021 20206.92% 6.04% 6.05% 1.42%1.03%0.77%5.10%5.34%5.70% 202264.0 202156.13.6%14.0% 202054.27.3%YoY GrowthNet Interest Income (in trillion Rupiah) Net Interest Margin (NIM)Cost of FundsEarning Assets Yield Net Interest Margin – NIM (non consolidated) Operating Income other than Interest Operating Income other than Interest (in billion Rupiah) 2022  2021  2020 Increase / (decrease)  2022 Increase / (decrease)  2021 Nominal % Nominal % Net Fee and Commission Income  16,584  14,680  13,160  1,904 13.0%  1,520 11.6% Net Trading Income  1,287  2,772  4,303  (1,485) -53.6% (1,531) -35.6% Other Operating Income  5,616 4,886  3,541  731 15.0% 1,345 38.0% Operating Income other than Interest  23,487 22,338  21,004  1,150 5.1% 1,334 6.4% Operating income other than interest rose by 5.1%, supported by the increase in net fees and commissions income.
Net trading income decreased by 53.6%, mainly due to one-off loss from NPL sale and a decrease in swap premiums  resulting from lower liquidity placements in foreign currencies compared to the previous year.
This was consistent with  the increase in Rupiah placements in Government and BI instruments, which generated higher yield as a result of the  rising BI 7DRR interest rate.
Other operating income grew by 14.9% compared to last year, supported by the proceeds from loan write-off recovery  and higher insurance premium income from BCA Life and BCA Insurance.

Income from customer deposits grew 12.7%, mainly  attributable to administrative income from payment  activities within our ecosystem.
This is in line with the  significant increase in the number of customers and  transaction volume during 2022.
Income from credit cards decreased by 10.6%,  due to accounting reclassification.
Assuming same  classification, income from credit cards posted positive  growth following the rise in tourism activities as borders reopened in many countries and domestically.

Income from payment settlements rose by 20.4%  compared to the previous year, mainly driven by virtual  accounts activities that surpassed pre COVID time.
Income from loans receivable grew 9.9% to Rp2.0 trillion,  mostly attributed to administrative fee and the loan  provision income, in line with solid loan growth in 2022.
Revenue from remittances, clearings, and collections also  recorded an increasing trend, by 126.6% to Rp775 billion.

Overall, we were able to manage cost-to-income ratio (CIR), recorded at 33.9%, compared to 34.9% in the previous  year.

The Bank’s profitability was  underpinned by solid performance in all levels of the Profit and Loss Statement.
As elaborated above, BCA booked  positive growth in net interest income and operating income other than interest on the back of strong loan growth,  robust CASA funds and higher payment settlement volumes across multi channels.

BCA Strategic Priorities and Projections for  2023 In general, BCA’s short- to medium-term policy directions  and strategic steps will refer to the following key strategic  initiatives: i.
Strengthening the transaction banking franchise  through payment settlement services  BCA consistently strengthens its payment settlement  service as the main growth driver of current account  and savings account (CASA) funds.
In line with this, BCA will continue to improve the  features and facilities of banking products and  services.
The implementation of these initiatives  is supported by reliable information technology  infrastructure and system security.
A wider and more integrated payment ecosystem  will become one of BCA’s focus.
A digital platform  for customer acquisition (digital on-boarding) and  collaboration with an external ecosystem will be used  to expand the customer base.
As a hybrid bank, BCA  continuously develops its multi-channel network,  comprising mobile banking, internet, branches, ATMs,  EDC, QR, contact centers, and other forms of digital  collaboration.
Discussion on the development of  multi-channel transaction banking is also available in  the Board of Directors Report and Transaction Banking  sections.
Quality loan disbursement  BCA constantly explores new business opportunities,  through data optimization and deepening processes  with existing customers, as well as exploring various  industries and potential customers.
The exploration  of new business opportunities also extends to the  networks of existing debtors.
In the midst of global uncertainty, loan disbursements  to customers require a disciplined implementation of  prudence principle.
This is performed through loan  diversification to mitigate the loan concentration risk  and close monitoring of loan quality.
BCA also sets  aside an adequate level of Allowance for Impairment  Losses for credit to anticipate potential asset quality  deterioration.
BCA also continues to strengthen the loan  infrastructure by using technological developments  and building human resource capacity to accelerate  the processes of loan disbursement and debtor  acquisition.
The discussion in each segment is also  reviewed in the Analysis and Management Discussion  section, under the sub-sections Corporate Banking   Commercial & SME Banking, and Individual Banking.
