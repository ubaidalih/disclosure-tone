The global economic recovery in 2021 is spearheaded by the US and China,  which have taken aggressive fiscal and monetary measures to stimulate their economies.
China’s economic recovery contributed to global economic recovery as China is one of the world’s economic powerhouses.138 PT United Tractors Tbk Laporan Tahunan 2021138 ikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.
GLob a L rEc ov E ry o pt I m I sm The World b ank in its report “Global Economic Prospects”,  January 2021, predicted that global economy would grew by 4% in 2021, after contracting 4.3% in 2020.
This projection was based, among others, on the assumption that COV i D-19  vaccine is becoming more widely available at a global scale and there is a more persistent global effort to tame COV i D-19.
The confidence that the spread of vaccine distribution would reach a fairly safe level by the middle of the year, pushed the economy to move faster.
International Monetary  fund (IM f ) projected world economic  growth in 2021 and 2022 at 6.4% and 4.4%, respectively.
i n  addition to vaccination, global economic recovery was  spearheaded by the two largest economies, the United  sta tes ( us ) and China.
i n the first quarter of 2021, the us   achieved 7.4% growth and China 18.3%.
b oth countries  were very aggressive in apply fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy.
China’s economy had indicated signs of recovery since the beginning of the year.
The value of China’s exports for January-February 2021 period jumped by 61% compared to the previous year.
The value of imports also increased by 22%.
thE pa N d E m I c I s Not ov E r yE t Like other countries, Indonesia is still struggling with the COV i D-19 pandemic.
Throughout 2021, i ndonesia  experienced at least two spikes in positive cases of COV i D-19.
The first spike occurred after Christmas and New  Year’s holidays.
On January 5, 2021, daily positive cases of COV i D-19 jumped to 7,445 cases.
Positive cases of COV i D-19  continued to experience a significant increase and peaked on January 16, 2021 with 14,224 cases, and on January 30, 2021 with 14,518 cases.
The number of positive cases of COV i D-19  then gradually decreased along with the handling of the government and related parties, including the COV i D-19  vaccination program which started simultaneously on January 13, 2021. 139 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.
s ubsequently, COV i D-19 positive cases fluctuated but was  still manageable.
The government realizes that the surge in positive cases of COV i D-19 always occurs after a long  national holiday.
Therefore, the government imposed a policy of restrictions to prevent crowds during Eid al-Fitr in  ma y 2021.
However, positive cases of COV i D-19 surged again  after Eid in June 2021.
Positive cases of COV i D-19 this time  were mainly caused by the Delta variant which was a new mutation originating from India with faster transmission than the previous variant.
Delta variant also has characteristics that can reduce the effectiveness of current vaccinations and medications.
During July 2 until 15, 2021, there were 523,695 additional  positive cases of COV i D-19.
On July 7, 2021, i ndonesia  became the epicenter of COV i D-19 with the highest death  rate in the world.
a t otal of 2,069 people died in one day.
The  high death rate was due to hospital’s capacity being unable to keep up with the surge in cases.
The spike in cases gradually fell in  august  2021.
Vaccination  is one way to reduce the spread of COV i D-19 virus by  achieving herd immunity.
Quoted from www.
id, as of December 31, 2021, as many as 157 million people or 79% of the target had received dose 1 and as many as 114 million people or 55% of the target had received dose 2.
The vaccination target was 208 million people or 77% of the total population of  i ndonesia.
With vaccination rates ranging from  1.6 million to 2 million injections per day, all targeted vaccine recipients are targeted to have received two doses by March 2022, including children aged 6-11 years.
The government implemented a number of policies to deal  with the COV i D-19 pandemic.
One of those was large-scale  social restrictions (PSBB).
This policy was applied since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic.
It was relaxed after the 2021 new-year spike, P sbb  policy was modified to impose  emergency public activity restriction (PPKM) following the surge due to Delta variant.
Emergency PPKM came into effect on July 1, 2021 in Java and  b ali because of the  significant spike in cases of COV i D-19 Delta variant on both  islands.

The emergency PPK m  policy was then changed to PPK m - level starting on July 20, 2021.
The determination of PPKM level from one region to another differs according to the indicators and assessments set by the Ministry of Health.
The achievement of COV i D-19 vaccination is also an assessment.
Restrictions on PPK m -level cover various fields of public  activity.
starting  from offices, schools, public facilities to  public transportation.
The strictest PPK m  is at Level 4.
if  the  handling of COV i D-19 cases and vaccinations are getting  better, the area can go down to Level 3 and so on.
a head  of Christmas and 2022 New Year holidays, the government again prepared a number of policies to prevent a spike in COV i D-19 cases.
domEs t I c Eco N omy was rEc ov E r ING Continuing the trend of recovery since the third quarter of 2020, entering 2021, economic growth kept increasing and managed to reach 7.1% (yoy) in the second quarter of 2021.
Indonesian economy returned to the positive zone, after the last few quarters being in the negative zone due to recessionary pressures.
This achievement was the highest growth in the last 17 years.
Economic growth was still supported by household  consumption and investment.
Consumer Confidence  i ndex  ( i KK) in the second quarter of 2021 was recorded at 104 points,  better than the same period in the previous year, which was 82 points.
Public confidence to back to consumption was also encouraged by vaccinations and the implementation of health protocols.
These two things are believed to make people’s mobility gradually return to normal in some activities, although with a number of restrictions.
The manufacturing industry became the trigger of economic  growth in the second quarter of 2021.
Despite being sluggish due to the impact of the explosion of COV i D-19 and PPK m   cases, manufacturing industry still has high resilience so that it can recover quickly.
Performance of non-oil and gas manufacturing industry grew by 6.9% on an annual basis in the second quarter of 2021.
Five non-oil and gas manufacturing industry sectors with the highest growth were: transportation equipment industry; base metal industry; machinery and equipment industry; rubber, rubber and plastic products industry; and the chemical, pharmaceutical and traditional medicine industry.141 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.
Unfortunately, in July until  august  2021, Indonesia was hit  by the second wave of COV i D-19, the Delta variant.
The  surge in the spread of COV i D-19 was unstoppable after Eid  holiday.
The increase in COV i D-19 cases was dominated by  the clusters of families, intercity travelers and homecomers.
Therefore, the government implemented a strict emergency  public activity restriction (PPKM) from 3 to 20 July, 2021.
Emergency PPK m  policy could not be avoided as an effort to  reduce the transmission of COV i D-19 so that hospitals were  not paralyzed due to excess capacity.
aft er the emergency  PPKM started, the number of cases and the percentage of hospital bed occupancy ratio (BOR) was shown to have decreased.
aft er emergency PPKM ended, based on the evaluation  results, the government extended it until July 25, 2021 under the name PPKM level IV.
fr om an epidemiological  perspective, the impact of emergency PPKM could reduce the positivity rate from 25.2% to more than 30%.
In terms of health services, the situation was better than the previous 2-3 weeks.
Nevertheless, the social restrictions hit business sector again, which affected economic growth in the third quarter that slowed to 3.51%, although still showing positive growth.
The government’s priority was to prioritize safety and health.
as  the trend of cases continued to decline, starting from  July 26, 2021, the government made steady easing.
Some of the activities allowed to open gradually with strict health protocols were traditional markets selling basic necessities, street vendors, grocery stores and other micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME).

co a L IN  th E  mI dd LE  of G Lob a L E NE r Gy   c r I s I s Economic resurgence of a number of countries due to the impact of the COV i D-19 pandemic has caused global energy  demand to soar significantly after nearly two years.
Prices of energy commodities, especially crude oil and natural gas, soared due to high demand from China, South Korea and parts of Europe, which could not be matched by supplies availability.
Energy sector players were trying to boost their production after experiencing a long hibernation due to the pandemic.
However, it took time before supply could recover and keep pace with demand.
Price of Brent crude oil futures touched the level of USD86  per barrel on October 25, the highest since 2018.
While natural gas hit a high of USD5.2 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) on September 1.
Natural gas is the source of main energy for power plants,  especially in developed countries in the European region.
Europe has started to close coal-fired power plants (PLT u )  due to commitments for decarbonization and net zero emissions in energy sector.
Coal is considered as the worst polluter, a source of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are the main causes of climate change.
This condition is increasingly critical as the power plant  capacity fueled by new and renewable energy (NRE) sources, such as wind and solar, is still far below demand.
European countries have no choice but to re-operate coal-fired power plants to cope with high prices and limited gas supply.
Eventually, the energy supply shortage escalated into a crisis  like what happened in China.
aft er a rapid recovery from the  stresses of the COV i D-19 pandemic, China’s economy has  slowed since the second half of 2021.
China’s transition to clean energy has been bumped into by increasing industrial demand and high commodity prices.
China’s industrial activity has declined since September due to limited power supplies and rising energy prices. 145 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.

Indonesia bersama negara lainnya berkomitmen untuk menjaga kenaikan suhu bumi tidak The energy crisis was also experienced by India, which was actually the second largest coal producer and the fourth largest owner of coal reserves in the world.
However, the surge in energy demand has resulted in insufficient domestic coal supply.
Coal production was also briefly disrupted by the severe flooding that hit eastern  i ndia and state capitals  during the monsoon season, which affected important logistics routes.
To boost the supply of energy sources, China and India  increased coal imports which caused global coal prices to boast.
i n October 2021, coal prices hit an all-time high.
The contract price of coal at NewCastle reached us D270  per ton.
In fact, for European market ( atlan tic market), CI f  a msterdam-Rotterdam- a ntwerp ( a Ra ) price touched  us D301 per ton in early October.

at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow, indonesia expressed its commitment to play a role in  tackling clima te change by targeting Net Zero Emissions (carbon neutrality) by 2060 or earlier.
This mission requires the carrying capacity of energy transition so as to open up space for optimal use of NRE.
The challenge is how to harmonize the demands of saving the environment with the balance of economic activity.
Currently, coal is still the main energy source, so the cessation of the use of coal must be performed gradually.
The transition from coal use to environmentally friendly energy sources must be supported by various policy instruments and large investments.
On the other hand, economic activity must be maintained during the transition.
The use of coal as an energy source involves many sectors and workers, ranging from mining, power plants, to PLN as a national power management company.

To support these efforts,  i ndonesia optimizes the use of NRE such as water,  wind, solar, or geothermal power plants to replace coal-fired power plants.
Coal-fired power plants are not the only GHG producers that  trigger global temperature increases.
GHG emissions can also come from vehicle exhaust (transportation), industrial activities, households, forest conversion or forest and land fires.
However, the pressure on coal as one of the primary energy sources for power plants continues to strengthen.
Many countries have called for the cessation of the operation of coal-fired power plants because burning coal is considered the main cause of air pollution.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) issued  2021-2030 Electric Power  s upply b usiness Plan (R u PTL),  which is the latest reference for PLN to develop electricity systems throughout  i ndonesia in 2021-2030 period.
b ased  on 2021-2030 R u PTL, the government plans to increase its  power plant capacity by 40,600 megawatts ( m W).
Of total 147 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.
The  remaining 19,700 m W or 48% are coal, gas and oil power  plants. 2021-2030 R u PTL is considered to have led to a green  energy transition because the portion of NRE development is larger than fossil energy.
In terms of NRE mix, hydropower plants (PLT a ) has the  largest share of 10,391 m W, followed by solar power plants  (PLT s ) of 4,680 m W, geothermal power plants (PLTP) of 3,355  m W and the rest is other NRE power plants.
Hydropower is a  priority because it has a low cost of electricity supply (BPP)  and has abundant potential, which is approximately 75,000  m W.
u ntil now, only about 6,100  m W has been utilized.
The larger portion of NRE sources is part of the government’s commitment to 2015 Paris  agr eement and to also respond to  global industry demands in terms of using environmentally friendly energy.
i n addition, in Government Regulation No. 79  of 2014 concerning National Energy Policy, the government targeted NRE mix of at least 23% in 2025 and to 31% in 2050 as long as commercially feasible.
Indonesia already prepared a roadmap towards net zero  emission in stages until 2030.
This roadmap is in accordance with NDC ( i ndonesia’s national contribution document  related to climate change) in the power sector and RUPTL.
One of the closest agenda is to ratify presidential regulations on NRE and coal termination.
The government set various strategic initiatives to reduce  the role of coal, for example: co-firing PLT u  scenario,  which is burning of coal with 5% - 10% biomass mixture.
The government will also develop Rooftop Solar PV on a massive scale.
The government encourages private investment with  Independent Power Producer (IPP) scheme at a larger portion in 2021-2030 R u PTL.
i PP gets 65% share or equivalent to  26,300 m W, while PLN gets 35% or 14,300 m W.
Of the large  private sector role, as much as 55% are non-NRE power plants and 45% are NRE power plants.
Private sector is very interested in investing in the  development of NRE power plants given the potential of abundant resources.

coN str U ct I o N  I N d U stry was rI s ING Construction industry was one of the sectors most affected by the COV i D-19 pandemic in 2020.
a lthough signs of  improvement was visible, construction industry had not fully returned to its maximum performance as before the pandemic.
a number  of problems occurred, such as  termination of construction projects, soaring material prices, as well as PPKM policies and health protocols which became the new responsibilities of contractors and increased project costs.
Despite those challenges, the performance of the  construction industry in 2021 was much better than in 2020 when its growth contracted by 3.3%.
i n the third quarter of 2021,  the growth in construction sector slowed to 3.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021 of 4.4% but remained in the positive zone.
The slowdown was experienced by almost all business sectors due to the second wave of COV i D-19, the  Delta variant.
This positive growth was in accordance with f itch Solutions  Country Risk & Industry research report in a pril 2021, which  predicted that construction sector would grow by 8.7% in  real terms in 2021.
The growth of construction sector this year was supported by the implementation of COV i D-19  vaccination, encouraging the use of domestic products and a number of government’s supports in infrastructure sector.
The government re-activated infrastructure development  to accelerate economic recovery in the midst of COV i D-19  pandemic.
i n 2021, the government’s infrastructure budget  reached Rp417 trillion, up 48% compared to Rp281 trillion in 2020 and was the largest in the last six years.
In addition, the government also allocated a budget of Rp26 trillion for the development of information and communication infrastructure.
The focus of government infrastructure development  is to improve connectivity and mobility to support strengthening basic services and increasing productivity.
In addition, the infrastructure budget will be used to provide affordable, reliable and environmentally friendly energy and food infrastructure, as well as equitable distribution of infrastructure and access to information technology across Indonesia.

Opportunities for domestic investors to become the government’s strategic partners in infrastructure  development are increasingly opening up with the presence of Indonesia Investment  authority  (IN a )  established by the Government.
IN a is belie ved to present a new chapter for the investment ecosystem in Indonesia.
The presence of IN a  opens up the in volvement of domestic investors for infrastructure projects with flexibility in investing, in terms  of funds and assets, as long as they comply with international investment standards.
i n accordance with the President’s direction regarding efforts to involve local potential, domestic  entrepreneurs, especially small and medium enterprises, must be included in every development project so  that government development projects have a simultaneous impact on the domestic economy.
This in turn will spur  i ndonesia’s economic recovery from the crisis caused by the COV i D-19 pandemic.
ac celeration of  recovery and economic growth can be encouraged through investments from various parties and institutions that will be managed by IN a .
Some of the infrastructure development plans this year  are the construction of 10,706 flats and special houses, 53 dams, 965 kilometers of roads, 27 kilometers of bridges, 447 kilometers of railway lines and 10 airports.
Furthermore, there is a plan to build a natural gas network for households with 120,776 house connections, as well as Rooftop  s olar PV  and PLT s  Cold  st orage with a total capacity of 11.8  m Wp.
Of the total budget, the m inistry of Public Works and Public  Housing (PUPR) received a budget allocation of Rp150 trillion.

The surge in cases of the  second wave of COV i D-19 in ma y-June had a negative impact  on the performance of EPC contractors and subcontractors.
Delivery of project cargo was delayed and mobilization of Technical  f ield advisor  (T fa ) personnel to the site for  construction and commissioning works could not be carried out due to restriction issued by the Government of  i ndonesia  and other countries.
BJP and EPC contractors continued to minimize the impact  of delays by implementing acceleration programs such as adding workers and regulating working hours.
In addition, to control and minimize the transmission of COV i D-19, b JP  vaccinated all workers including EPC contractor workers and conducted screening Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and PCR to ensure the health and safety of workers during the commissioning period.
at  end of 2021, the project progress  reached 99.38%.
In line with business development strategy in the  environmentally friendly energy sector, the Company established New and Renewable Energy business as one of the Company transition strategies.
To accelerate NRE development, by the end of 2021 all energy businesses in the group were consolidated in PT Energia Prima Nusantara (EPN), in the future the energy segment will focus on NRE development.

as an engineering c ompany, UTPE has the  competence to implement a differentiation strategy by designing products that are tailored to the needs of each customer (customized product).
UTPE continues to improve its capabilities to further expand the product variants that can be produced.
P aTR ia  brand is u TPE’s flagship product which has  been known as a premium product in mining sector.
The  advantages of P aTRI a pr oducts are supported by a reliable  after sales service team; while digitization of customer service is  u TPE’s competitive advantage in the engineering  and manufacture services business.
Performance in 2021 in 2021, u TPE recorded a significant growth in performance.
u TPE recorded consolidated revenues of Rp2.7 trillion, up 63%  compared to Rp1.7 trillion in 2020.
The revenue contribution came from heavy industry of 46% and maritime industry of 54%.
Heavy industry consisted of the mining sector, the non-mining sector (forestry & plantation, industrial, construction and logistics), and the parts & services sector.
This achievement was driven by a number of opportunities  that could be well optimized, including:•  i ncrease in coal price index since the end of 2020 was a  momentum for coal industry players to invest in heavy equipment.
•  Digital  revolution and big data that were accelerating  during the pandemic caused a change in the pattern of interaction with customers and business processes.
UTPE was ready to face this change since the development of digitalization-based systems and processes has been going on for several years.
•  Cust omer demands were increasingly critical to aspects  of on-time delivery, competitive prices, product quality, technical support, product safety aspects and after sales service ( aSS).
a ll of which are competitive advantages  of UTPE and UT group in their respective industries. 177 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.

•  i ndonesia’s commitment to reduce emissions was an  opportunity for u TPE to develop low-emission and  environmentally friendly products.
On the other hand, UTPE also faced a number of challenges.
The prolonged pandemic caused various impacts, such as a significant increase in raw material prices during 2021 and postponement of a number of national strategic projects that affected sales achievement in industrial and construction sectors.
In addition, government regulations related to coke content (TKDN) for body builders (on road products) could be both a challenge and an opportunity for UTPE.

Performance in 2021 In 2021, PML was able to achieve an excellent performance with an increase in revenue of Rp855 billion, up 50% compared to Rp571 billion in 2020.
This achievement was mainly influenced by the high increase in the coal price index during 2021.
The increase in revenue also came from non-coal  transportation and the addition of a non-group customer base such as PLN’s subsidiaries (PT Pelayaran  b ahtera  adiguna  and PT PLN b atubara).
Non-coal transportation  included cement cargo from PT Conch Cement Indonesia, nickel in Sulawesi region and ballast cargo from abroad.
Coal transportation market itself was still wide open in line  with the addition of new PLT u  35 m W project that was  already operating commercially and new Domestic Market Obligation (D m O) policy that requires coal companies to  supply a certain amount of coal for domestic purposes.

P m L also faced a number of challenges, such as: fluctuating  coal market, the tendency of main importing countries of Indonesian coal to start reducing the use of coal due to environmental issues, as well as the presence of competing shipping companies with aggressive tariff differentiation strategy, more experience in operating mother vessel (MV) and larger barges of up to 395 feet.
Business Strategy During 2021, PML implemented a number of strategies and initiatives to expand market coverage and to drive revenue growth, including:•  i ncreasing the number of vessels in operations to 56  vessels from 45 vessels in 2020.
•  i ncreasing market coverage to non-group customers.
•  i ncreasing revenue in the non-coal sector, such as  transportation of nickel cargo and ballast cargo from abroad.
Transportation from abroad was also a strategic step for PML to enter overseas market.
•  u tilizing boats for downstream routes when the water  recedes.
•  Oper ating s elf Properel b arge ( s P b ) for dedicated  routes and exploring new routes.
•  E ntering overseas route transportation business which  served 3 shipping routes from Indonesia to Cambodia and Vietnam.
•  s tudying  and exploring of palm oil (CPO) transportation  business.
In addition, PML continued to make internal development and improvement to increase its competitive advantage which included digitalization, operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as human capital.

Global economy since mid-2021 has recovered from the recession caused by the pandemic.
However, soaring inflation, global supply chain bottlenecks and the emergence of Omicron  s a R s -CoV-2 strain at the end of the year raised  new concerns and signaled that the world still has to face uncertainty in the quest for a global economic recovery.
Global inflation rose to its highest level in 2021 compared to  previous years worldwide as consumers return to shopping, while industries faced shortages of raw materials and supply chain disruptions.
Prices of oil, natural gas, and various raw materials, such as wood, copper and steel, jumped sharply.
a  number of countries recorded impressive growth figures,  especially developed countries that have better access to a COV i D-19 vaccine.
The u nited sta tes ( us ) managed to  overcome the worst crisis since the Great Depression of 1929, while Eurozone economy was able to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
IM f and OE CD predicted world economic  growth of around 4.9% and 4.5% in 2022 from 5.9% ( im F) and  5.7% (OECD) in 2021.
The main drivers of world economic growth in 2022 will increase, namely the US, China and Europe; previously, there were only the  us  and China.
There are a number of reasons for Indonesia to be optimistic about welcoming 2022.
COV i D-19 pandemic as the root of  multidimensional crisis is indicated to be more controllable.
Vaccination that has proven to be the best efforts together with the implementation of health protocols continue to increase in scope.
Quoted from the www.
id, as of December 31, 2021, as many as 157 million people or 80% of the target received dose 1 and as many as 114.
million people or 55% of the target received dose 2.
Target vaccination is 208 million people or 77% of the total population of  i ndonesia.
With vaccination rates ranging from  1.6 million to 2 million injections per day, all targeted vaccine recipients are targeted to have received two doses by March 2022. 197 PT United Tractors Tbk 2021 Annual Reportikhtisar utama Main HighlightsLaPO ra N ma N a JE m EN Management ReportPrOFiL PE rusahaa N Company ProfileaNaLisis & PE mBahasa N maNaJEmEN Management Discussion & Analysistata  kELOL a  PE rusahaa N Corporate GovernanceLaPO ra N k E ua NG a N kON s OL i Da sia N Consolidated Financial Statements UT_AR2021.
indd   197 3/31/22   15:50 National economy has also started to improve.
aft er  contracting in the first quarter of 2021, economy continued to  grow with a positive trend in the next three quarters.
Economic indicators, such as: Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), purchasing power, direct investment, balance of payments and others, appeared to be running positively.
Even in 2022,  i ndonesia is elected to hold the G-20 presidency, which will  certainly benefit the national economy.
The government estimates that economic growth can reach  5.5% from the target of 5.2% in 2022.
The World b ank in its  report on Indonesia's economic prospects in December 2021, titled " a  Green Horizon: Toward a high Growth and Low  Carbon Economy", estimated Indonesia's economic growth would reach 3.7% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022, as long as there are no significant changes.
Yet, a number of serious challenges remain to be faced.
The COV i D-19 pandemic is still not fully under control even  though a number of indicators show improvement.
The number of cases is expected to remain volatile throughout 2022 due to Omicron strain which spreads faster than the previous strain.
Indonesia must continue to use the brake-and-gas scenario, balancing life (health aspect) and livelihood (economic recovery aspect) in the years ahead.
Currently, the government is preparing for transition from pandemic to endemic.
Nonetheless, the pandemic has a silver lining, that in addition  to uncertainty, the pandemic also increases the urgency of transformation and transition.
Transformation is increasingly needed as uncertainty increases.
Transition is even more important when there are not many options.
The pandemic has made the space for movement and choice narrower, but at the same time it has opened up the widest possible space for innovation.
co a L I N d U stry p roj Ec t I o N Indonesian Coal Mining associa tion ( a PBI) is optimistic that  the demand for coal in 2022 will continue to increase in line with global economic recovery.
Indonesia's coal exports are predicted to remain high because the majority of Indonesia's coal is exported to  asia  Pacific, which still relies on coal as  an energy source.
In addition, a number of countries are still building new coal-fired steam power plants (PLT u ) that  require a long-term guarantee of coal supply considering that the minimum age of the PLTU is around 30 years before its efficiency declines.

indd   198 3/31/22   15:50 International Energy agenc y (IE a ) estimated that worldwide  coal demand has the potential to reach an all-time high in the  next two years.
Global demand for coal this year, especially for the steel, cement and power generation industries, was estimated to increase by 6%.
Domestically, PLN estimated that the demand for coal in  2022 for the electricity sector would reach 119 million tons.
Of this amount, as many as 68 million tons are for PLN's PLTU and 51 million tons are for private/IPP (independent power producer) PLTU.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM)  projected that coal production quota in 2022 would range between 637-664 million tons.
Of this amount, it was estimated that domestic industry would need 190 million tons.
The plan to increase the national coal production quota is still at a rational figure in the import prospect map of the importing countries.
ac cording to the projected total imports of various countries  of 1 billion tons, Indonesian market for China, India, East  asia and Southeast asia is almost 83% open.
The growth of  coal demand in these four regions was projected to reach around 50 million tons by 2022.
In terms of energy mix and the large capacity of coal-fired power plants in China and India, it is expected that these two countries will continue to be the mainstay of Indonesia's coal exports.
This is one of the considerations for the Government of  i ndonesia to increase  national coal production.
a lthough economic growth continues to show a recovery  trend, global conditions still pose various risk factors that have the potential to slow down growth.
One of them is the prolonged pandemic, as Omicron, the new COV i D-19  variant, was discovered.
The spread of Omicron may trigger countries to re-implement social restriction policies to lockdown.
If that happens, then energy demand will slump again and have a negative impact on economic growth in the first quarter of 2022.
In the midst of the projected sloping global economic growth  in 2022, environmental issues are one of the factors that will affect coal prices.
However, environmental issues are not expected to have a significant impact next year, considering that various coal importing countries, particularly China and India, are still planning to increase coal imports.
indd   199 3/31/22   15:50 PROSPEK D a N RENC a N a KE DEP a N Prospect and futur e Plan for  a longer time period, the capacity of NRE power plants  continues to grow in line with the demands to mitigate the climate change impacts.
The sustainable growth of NRE will pressure coal in the future.
Moreover, the cost of generating NRE electricity is getting cheaper along with technological developments.
Wind and solar power plants currently supply nearly 10% of global electricity demand; this number will continue to increase every year.
In addition, more and more countries are planning to remove  coal from their power grids.
at the C OP26 Climate Summit,  23 countries committed to discontinuing coal-fired power plants, including five of the top 20 coal-using countries.
Canada and most of Europe now intend to completely abandon coal.
Even developing countries such as a number of  african  countries have pledged to phase out coal.
Given  their fast-growing economy, this will be a major influence on future coal demand.
GoLd INdUstry proj Ec t I o N Quoted from the World b ank's “Commodity mark ets Outlook”  October 2021 report, the World b ank's Precious me tals i ndex  fell by 3% in Q3-2021 compared to the previous quarter, driven by weaker investment due to higher real interest rates, stronger US dollar and lower physical demand.
The decline is expected to continue in 2022, at 3% due to some tightening of monetary policy.
Gold prices are expected to decrease by 2.5% in 2022, due  to outflows of gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETF).
i n  addition, the central bank also reduced gold purchases in recent months.
s ince the third quarter of 2021, gold prices have fallen by  1.4%, partly driven by a decline in investment demand amid rising interest rate yields.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury  i nflation-Protected s ecurities (T i P s ) increased by 10 basis  points in September and the US dollar strengthened after the US  feder al Reserve signaled it would start cutting back  on bond purchases before the end of the year.
Nevertheless, demand for jewelry that is still strong in China  and India will provide a little positive sentiment towards the movement of gold prices in 2022.
indd   200 3/31/22   15:50 coN str U ct I o N  I N d U stry p roj Ec t I o N Construction industry players are optimistic that construction  market will improve in 2022 in line with the easing of various mobility restrictions related to COV i D-19 pandemic.
s ome  factors that can have positive influence on the recovery of the construction sector include fiscal stimulus, financial capacity of developers and contractors, ease of mobilization of construction labor market, and availability of supply of building materials.
a surv ey by a construction research institute revealed that the  prospect of construction industry in 2022 would get better in line with national economic recovery.
The research provided an overview of the potential value of construction projects ranging from building construction to housing.
The value of building construction projects was estimated to reach Rp157 trillion, driven by growth in housing and industrial sectors.
Other categories, such as hotels, retail, and offices, will also grow positively compared to 2021.
Industrial category was estimated to grow with a project value of Rp37 trillion.
Increased investment in the industrial sector is getting better as the government's COV i D-19 vaccination program reaches  higher coverage.

indd   201 3/31/22   15:50 PROSPEK D a N RENC a N a KE DEP a N Prospect and futur e Plan Optimistic view of construction industry is partly due to the  government's commitment to continuing infrastructure projects in various sectors.
Infrastructure will be the backbone and one of the main drivers of the 2022 construction market.
The value of infrastructure projects is estimated to reach Rp107 trillion.
The government is increasingly engaging private sector to  take part in the development, financing and management of large infrastructure projects.
To encourage private investment, the government intends to streamline the bureaucracy for privately financed infrastructure projects.
The government's infrastructure development targets in  2022 include ongoing construction of 32 dams, construction of 5,000 ha of irrigation, construction of 354 km of roads, construction and duplication of 7 km of bridges, preservation and replacement of 116,700 m of bridges, as well as construction of 51,000 flats.
mean while, the m inistry  of PUPR will commence 13 strategic projects that are part of the government's 2022 infrastructure development targets.
The government's decision to continue working on  infrastructure projects is not only to drive the economy but also to help deal with the pandemic.
Delivery of goods such as medicine and food to various regions in  i ndonesia requires  adequate connectivity infrastructure such as ports, airports and toll roads.
With continued infrastructure development, the government can handle the COV i D-19 pandemic more  efficiently and effectively and also help the i ndonesian  economy grow during and post-pandemic.
ENErGy  I N d U stry p roj Ec t I o N at the COP26 Climate s ummit in Glasgow s cotland at the  end of 2021, as many as 200 countries agreed to gradually reduce the use of fossil fuels in the future.
The participating countries agreed that the burning of fossil fuels was the cause of climate crisis.
aft er experiencing a delay of more than a year, the Ministry  of Energy and m ineral Resources finally released 2021  Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL 2021) in October 2021.
R u PTL 2021 marked the first shift in i ndonesia from  relying mostly on fossil fuel generators towards renewable energy.
indd   202 3/31/22   15:50 In the first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),  Indonesia se t unconditional target of 29% and conditional  target of up to 41% compared to business as usual in 2030.
i ndonesia is a country that is vulnerable to the adverse effects  of climate change and contributes to global GHG emissions.
i ndonesia is highly committed to reducing GHG emissions  by encouraging forestry sector through deforestation and  rehabilitating mangrove forests and also the energy sector through encouragement of renewable energy use.
fUtUrE prosp Ec t although the year 2022 shows an optimistic prospect,  the Compan y must remain aware of uncertainty.
Every  component of the Company must be able to take quick steps in order to respond to very dynamic changes.
Therefore, we need the ability to do swift reverse direction.
Not only change direction but also swift reverse direction.
The Company must have agile capabilities to respond to business volatility.
In addition to focusing on 2022 growth targets, the  Company needs to anticipate the phenomenon of change in each business segment to ensure long-term business sustainability.
i n line with E s G framework and  the implementation of 2015 Paris agr eement, world coal  demand is expected to continue to decline in the long term.
The decline in global coal demand will have impact on Indonesia's declining coal production.
This has the potential to reduce revenues and profits in the Company.
The counterbalance that can be done is to utilize the coal  assets owned to the maximum extent possible.
Utilization of coal assets can be reached through the downstream coal business, where this portfolio is a very different from the Company’s existing business.
Each subsidiary must focus on developing new business landscape that is in line with the long-term corporate strategy so that they can contribute meaningful impact to the sustainability of  u T Group's  business.
The Company's business portfolio, both existing and new  business landscapes, will result in carbon emissions, waste generation and energy consumption.
E s G framework  demands targets setting for science-based environmental management programs by applying international standard measurement methods in order to measurably monitor the Dalam Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Pertama, Indonesia memiliki target tanpa syarat sebesar 29% dan target bersyarat hingga 41% dibandingkan  business as usual   pada tahun 2030.
indd   203 3/31/22   15:50 PROSPEK D a N RENC a N a KE DEP a N Prospect and futur e Plan progress of the established programs in carrying out the  transition to net zero emission.
These issues, in addition to indicators of water management, liquid waste,  b 3 and  non- b 3 waste, are the main aspects that will continue to  be the attention of stakeholders related to the Company's business portfolio.
The Company must be more aggressive in adopting the latest  technology and innovations to be able to control carbon emissions, waste and energy consumption as efficiently as possible, among others by using Solar PV for electricity purposes in offices, plants or mess; implementation of advanced fleet management; the use of electric vehicles for operations in the area; and implementation of circular economy or 6R in every operation and supporting line.
Construction Machinery Segment Positive momentum is expected to continue in 2022.
Therefore, the Company must be able to be in a leading position in obtaining information on the readiness of heavy equipment supply so that it can prepare itself much better.
The Company also continues to strive to increase market coverage and to create product specifications with the Principals to meet customer needs.
Simultaneously, digitization program will also continue to improve product support services and customer satisfaction.
Mining Contracting Segment Volatility of coal prices is still the main factor affecting P ama ' s  business.
Coal prices movements will affect customers' production targets which have an impact on P a M a' s  production performance.
Challenges of coal industry in Indonesia in the near future  will increase with the enactment of Law Number 3 of 2020 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining.
Conversion of Coal  m ining Concession Work agr eement (PKP2 b ) into m ining  Business Permit (IUP) will gradually be performed by coal mining companies as licensing contract expires.
P a M a as  a c ontractor, most of whose customers are PKP2B permit  holders, must be prepared to face the possibility of carrying out mining activities on a smaller scale.
i n addition, P ama   must be prepared to deal with E s G issues  with anticipatory measures.
One of the concerns is energy transition where the long-term demand for coal, which is one of high GHG emitters, is certain to decline with the pressure of Paris  agr eement.
This poses a threat to the continuity of  coal business.
indd   204 3/31/22   15:50 as a c ountermeasure, P a M a has start ed to move towards  obtaining a new business landscape, either to the  development of downstream coal or switching to a different portfolio while continuing to conduct thorough feasibility analysis.
P a M a  will also start conducting research and  development (R&D) as the basis for the decision to undertake the new business landscape.
P a M a has c onsistently  expanded its portfolio of other minerals such as polymetallic (not limited to gold and copper), both through intensification and extensification, in the domestic and overseas markets.
Coal Mining Segment The prospect of thermal coal business is predicted to decline further as Zero Carbon Emission movement is getting louder in the world to reduce the use of fossil fuels, including coal, and transition to NRE development.
Management is aware of this potential.
Therefore, they are very focused on all environmental maintenance activities around the mine as well as contributing to the community around the mine.
Gold Mining Segment PTaR will continue to improve the operational efficiency of  martabe  mine by maintaining a ll- i n s ustaining Cost ( ais C)  to be consistently at a competitive level.
The strategy is to increase mining contractor productivity, to increase gold resources and reserves through advanced and regional exploration programs, as well as to increase recovery through optimization of Vertimill, Oxygen Shear Reactor & ReCyn.
Long-term projects such as the construction of Tailings Management  facility  (TM f ) and studies related to  Sulphide project will also continue in 2022.
In 2022, PT a R will improve standard operating procedures  and overall management system to achieve Martabe  Operational Excellence.
at  the same time, PT a R will improve  the culture of innovation through a new mechanism in Martabe Improvement Program (MIP).
Digitalization initiatives will also continue to be carried out to  increase the effectiveness and efficiency of work processes, both in core and supporting processes.
Organizational and employee development are also the main focus to create an effective organization in a conducive work environment.
indd   205 3/31/22   15:50 PROSPEK D a N RENC a N a KE DEP a N Prospect and futur e Plan Construction Industry Segment Construction industry is expected to rise, driven by the  construction of government infrastructure projects such as toll roads (landed and elevated) and power plants.
This is in line with  aCSET' s strategy to target more infrastructure  projects.
aCSET  sees the government's openness to involve  private sector in working together to build Indonesia's infrastructure as an opportunity that must be seized.
However,  aCSET  is still actively looking for opportunities  in foundation and structure projects that can add value to  aSCET' s competencies.
aCSET  will continue the strategy that has been implemented  in 2021 with better quality differentiation and specialization.
aCSET  will selectively select construction projects that are  in accordance with its competencies and capacities.
The internal improvements carried out in 2021 are expected to bring benefits to  aC s ET in the future when the industrial  situation and conditions are more conducive.
indd   206 3/31/22   15:50 Energy segment The Company, through its subsidiary EPN, is currently  focusing on developing renewable energy power plants to increase the portion of a balanced energy mix in its portfolio.
To accelerate the development of renewable energy in the  Company's group, at the end of 2021, all energy businesses were consolidated into PT EPN, including structuring of   PT  b ina Pertiwi Energi which is currently developing a mini- hydro power plant (PLTM) in Bukit Kemuning, Lampung.
The project is currently under construction and is planned to start operating in 2023.
The development of renewable energy, solar PV and hydropower will continue to be enhanced in the future.
In addition, EPN also focuses on conducting study, research  and development on Renewable Energy technologies to look for potential opportunities to increase the portion in the energy mix within  astr a Group.
EPN also develops  renewable energy projects such as large-scale hydropower, geothermal, floating solar PV, wind power and waste-to-energy.
These projects are in line with the Company's strategy to increase competence in various renewable energy potentials to expand a sustainable business portfolio.
