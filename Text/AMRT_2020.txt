SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENT TO  REGULATIONS Government Regulation Number 35 Year 2021 - Job  Creation Law on February 2, 2021, the Government promulgated and enforced Government Regulation Number 35 Year 2021 (PP 35/2021) to implement the provisions of Article 81 and Article 185 (b) of Law no. 11/2020 concerning Job Creation which aims to create the broadest possible job opportunities.
PP 35/2021 regulates work agreements for a certain  period of time (non-permanent employees), outsourcing, working time, rest periods and termination of employment, which can affect the minimum benefits that shall be provided to employees.
At the date the consolidated financial statements were  authorized, the Group was still evaluating the potential impact of implementing the implementing regulations PP 35/2021, including the impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the next reporting period.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group applies PSAK 71: Financial Instruments, PSAK 72: Income from Contracts with Customers, and PSAK: 73: Leases for the first time.
The nature and effects of the changes as a result of this new accounting standard are described below.
Several amendments and other interpretations were  effective for the first time in 2020, but have no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not made early adoption of any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been published but have not been effective as of January 1, 2020.
PSAK 71: Financial Instruments PSAK 71: Financial Instruments replaces PSAK 55: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.
Standar tersebut menetapkan prinsip-prinsip untuk The Group has not restated corresponding information for 2019 for financial instruments in the scope of PSAK 71.
Therefore, the corresponding information for 2019 is reported under PSAK 55 and is not comparable with the information presented for 2020.
Differences, if any, arising from the adoption of PSAK 71 have been recognized directly in retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.
PSAK 72: Revenue from Contracts with  Customers PSAK 72 supersedes PSAK 34: Construction Contracts,  PSAK 23: Revenue and related Interpretations and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with customers.
PSAK 72 establishes a five- step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with the customers and requires that revenue be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customers.
PSAK 72 requires entities to exercise judgment, taking  into account all relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to making contracts with their customers.
This standard also specifies the accounting for additional costs of obtaining a contract and costs that are directly related to fulfilling a contract.
In addition, these standards require extensive disclosure.
The Group applied PSAK 72 using retrospective application  method with an initial application date of January 1, 2020.
Under this method, the standard can be applied to all contracts on the initial implementation date or only to contracts that did not finish promptly.
The Business Group chose to apply the standard for all contracts by 1 January 2020.
There is no significant effect of PSAK 72 implementation  on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
PSAK 73: Leases PSAK 73 replacing PSAK 30: Leases, ISAK 8: Determining whether an Arrangement contains Lease, ISAK 23: Operating Leases-Incentives and ISAK 24: Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognise most of the part in the balance sheet.
Lessor accounting under PSAK 73 does not change  substantially from PSAK 30.
Lessors will continue to classify the lease as an operating or financial lease using the same principles as in PSAK 30.
Therefore, PSAK 73 has no impact on leases in which the Group is the lessor.
The Group applies PSAK 73 using the modified  retrospective application method with an initial application date of January 1, 2020.
Based on this method, the standards are applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of the standards recognized at the initial application date.
The Group chooses to use a transitional practical policy not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains a lease on January 1, 2020.
Instead, the Group applies the standard only to contracts previously identified as leases that apply PSAK 30 and ISAK 8 at the date of initial application.
The Group has lease contracts for various location and  vehicle leases.
Prior to the adoption of PSAK 73, the Group classified each lease (as lessee) at the inception date as finance lease or operating lease.
By applying PSAK 73, the Group adopts a single   recognition and measurement approach for all leases  except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
This standard sets out the special transitional requirements and the practical means that have been implemented by the Business Group.
Leases that are previously classified as finance  lease The Group does not change the initial carrying amount of  assets and liabilities recognized at the early application date of the leases that were previously classified as finance leases (ie, use rights assets and leased liabilities are the same as leased assets and liabilities recognized under PSAK 30).
The requirements of PSAK 71 apply for this lease starting January 1, 2020.
Leases previously recorded as operating leases The Group recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities previously classified as operating leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The right use of assets for most leases are recognized on a carrying amount as if the standard had always been applied, other than the use of interest rates on additional borrowings at the initial application date.
Under some leases, the right of use assets becomes recognized at a equal amount to obligation, adjusted for the previously recognized lease payments and accrued payments.
Lease liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the additional borrowing interest rate at the initial   application date.
The Business Group also applies available practical means  where:•  Use a single discount rate for lease portfolios with  fairly similar characteristics • Subject to the judgment whether the lease becomes onerous immediately prior to the initial application date •  Implemented short-term lease waiv ers for leases with  leases ending in 12 months from the date of initial application •  Excludes initial direct costs from measuring the right  of use assets at the date of initial application • Use reconsider ation in determining the term of the  lease over which the contract contains the option to extend or terminate the lease.
On January 1, 2020, the Group booked the rights of use assets through reclassification of prepaid rent and recorded lease liabilities amounting to Rp4,179,865 million and Rp555,747 million, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group recorded depreciation of the right of use assets and additional finance costs amounting to Rp1,642,047 million and Rp42,948 million, respectively.
