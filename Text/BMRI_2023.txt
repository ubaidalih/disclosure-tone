Global economic prospects in  2023 continue to improve despite  the pressures of the pandemic  and the spread of Russia’s war with Ukraine.
However, the  pace is anticipated to drop, GLOBAL ECONOMIC  ANALYSIS accompanied by growing  disparities in economic  growth among countries.
The  International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the world  economy will reach 3.1% in 2023, a decline from 3.5%  in 2022.
Meanwhile, the IMF  projects that economic growth  in the United States (US) and China would be 2.5% and 5.2%,  respectively, in 2023.

Despite the bankruptcy of several banks with high exposure to the technology industry, the US economy  will continue to develop strongly in 2023, fueled primarily by household consumption and a domestic- oriented service sector.
Conversely, China’s economic growth is expected to decrease in 2023 due  to weaker consumption and a property sector crisis.
Meanwhile, the European economy continues to experience stagflation in 2023.
On the other hand, India and the ASEAN region proved to be somewhat  resilient as bright spots, with relatively high economic growth compared to other regions, supported by  recovering consumption and export performance.
In terms of global geopolitical risks, the pressure elevates in line with the Israeli and Hamas conflict in the  second half of 2023, as well as the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war.
These geopolitical risks certainly have the potential to significantly disrupt the pace of the global economy if the escalation continues.
In addition,  global geopolitical risks are also vulnerable to trigger an increase in world energy and food prices, which  certainly add pressure to the global inflation rate.3.5 3.1 Dunia3.1 1.62.6 1.5 Negara Maju4.14.14.1 Negara Berkembang4.6 3.05.2 Cina2.1 1.92.5 Amerika  Serikat1.01.9 0.9 Jepang7.2 6.76.5 India8.7 4.04.3 Malaysia1.03.6 2.1 singapura7.6 5.36.0 Filipina1.42.62.3 Korea  Selatan8.0 4.75.8 Vietnam2.62.54.4 Thailand1.81.43.8 Australia Taiwan2.4 0.83.0 2002 2003 2004 257 ANNUAL REPORT 2023CORPORATE GOVERNANCEESG COMMITMENTS& PRACTICESSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTALRESPONSIBILITYFINANCIALSTATEMENTS 2023   To curb inflation that remains above the medium- long term target for 2023, advanced countries  responded by maintaining the implementation of  higher for longer interest rate policies, including the Federal Funds Rate (FFR).
The FFR rate as of  December 2023 is at the level of 5.25% - 5.50%,  an increase of 525 basis points (bps) from 0.25% in January 2022.
The increase in global interest  rates is expected to be followed by long-term  tenors with an increase in yields on government bonds in developed countries, particularly the US  (US Treasury).
This condition certainly triggered  foreign capital outflows from Emerging Markets to developed countries and encouraged significant  strengthening of the US dollar against various  world currencies.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS In terms of global trade volume, the IMF forecasts 0.4% growth in 2023, which is lower than the  5.2% achieved in 2022.
Meanwhile, the Global  Manufacturing PMI, according to J.
Morgan and S&P Global, continued to show a weakening trend  at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023,  struggling in the contraction zone (below 50.0), or decreased from 49.3 in November 2023 to 49.0  in December 2023.
This is attributable in part to a  weakening of international trade flows, which has an impact on the tightening of the employment  market. 258 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMANAGEMENTREpORTCOMpANYpROfILE MAIN HIGHLIGHTSMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS J.

INDONESIA’S ECONOMIC  ANALYSIS Indonesia’s economic development is recorded  to keep growing strongly until the third quarter of  2023, demonstrating resilience to the influence of  global propagation.
The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) noted that Indonesia’s economy grew 4.94%  (yoy) until the third quarter of 2023.
Economic  growth was supported by most business areas, except Government Administration, Defense  and Compulsory Social Security and Education  Services which contracted by 6.23% and 2.07% respectively.
Business fields that grew significantly  were Transportation and Warehousing by 14.74%  and followed by Other Services by 11.14%.

Investment growth is also  considered by BI to remain sound with the sustainability of the completion of National Strategic Projects (PSN).
However, real growth of goods exports declined in line with weakening demand from major trading partner  countries, particularly China, and falling commodity prices.
Meanwhile, service exports continued to grow  strongly in line with the increase in the number of foreign tourists.
In light of these developments, BI forecasts that Indonesia’s economy will grow by 4.5% to 5.3% by the end  of 2023.
In the interim, the Indonesian government projects that the national economic growth will expand by 5.1% in 2023.
According to the World Economic Outlook report published by the IMF in January 2024, it is  anticipated that Indonesia’s economy will grow by 5.00% in 2023.
BI forecasted that Indonesia’s Balance of Payments  (BOP) performance in 2023 continues to sustain  external stability.
The trade balance surplus remained  to continue at USD3.3 billion in 2023 and support a healthy current account outlook with predictions in  the range of a surplus of 0.4% to a deficit of 0.4% of  GDP.
Meanwhile, in terms of net inflows in the form of portfolio investment to domestic financial markets,  the figure was also recorded to continue at USD5.4  billion at the end of 2023.
Meanwhile, the position of reserve assets in Indonesia stood at USD146.38 billion  in 2023, equivalent to financing 6.7 months of imports  or 6.5 months of imports and servicing government external debt, which is above the international  adequacy standard of around 3 months of importsINDONESIA’S ECONOMIC ANALYSIS Foreign Exchange Reserves (USD Billion) 2023* 2022 2021 2020 2019129.18135.89144.91 137.23146.38 Source: BI.

In relation to the development of the Rupiah  exchange rate, the strong US dollar has caused  pressure to weaken various currencies of other  countries, including the Rupiah exchange rate.
But towards the end of the year, global currencies turned  stronger against the US dollar in line with the Federal  Reserve’s plan to lower its benchmark interest rate in 2024.
In the December 2023 FOMC meeting, the Fed  stated that it would cut its benchmark interest rate  three times to 4.75% in 2024.
Compared to the end of 2022, the US dollar exchange rate index against  major currencies (DXY) in December 2023 was at  the level of 101.3 or decreased by 2.14% (ytd).
The decline in the DXY Index provides an opportunity for  appreciation of major currencies, as can be seen from the strengthening of the Euro currency which  closed at 1.1037 or recorded an increase of 3.1% in  2023, the first appreciation since 2020.
Similarly, the  pound sterling currency which strengthened against the US dollar closed at 1.2730, or strengthened by  5.2% in 2023, its highest appreciation since 2017.
The rupiah also closed up 1.1% (ytd) against the US dollar at a level of 15,397.
Meanwhile, the policy mix  adopted by BI will also be continued to maintain  exchange rate stability and encourage capital flows into the market.
Bank Indonesia has issued several  new pro-market instruments such as Bank Indonesia  Rupiah Securities (SRBI), Bank Indonesia Foreign Exchange Securities (SVBI), and Bank Indonesia  Foreign Exchange Sukuk (SUVBI).

BPS records low inflation of 2.61% (yoy) with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 116.6 as of December 2023.
Controlled inflation is a tangible result of monetary policy consistency to ensure inflation remains within the  target corridor, government policy as a shock absorber of global turmoil, as well as close synergy in inflation control between Bank Indonesia and the Government (Central and Regional) in the Central and Regional  Inflation Control Teams (TPIP and TPID) through strengthening the National Movement for Food Inflation Control  (GNPIP) in various regions.
Inflation in 2023 occurred due to an increase in prices indicated by an increase in all expenditure group indexes, namely the food, beverage and  tobacco group by 6.18%; clothing and footwear  group by 0.78%; housing, water, electricity and household fuel groups at 0.50%; household  equipment, equipment and routine maintenance  group at 1.57%; health group by 1.94%; transport group by 1.27%; information, communication and  financial services group at 0.20%; leisure, sports  and cultural groups at 1.69%; education group by 1.97%; food and beverage/restaurant supply group  by 2.07%; and the personal care and other services  group at 3.55%.
To maintain economic stability and growth in 2023,  Bank Indonesia continued to strengthen monetary policy to mitigate the impact of global economic  turmoil on rupiah stability.
After maintaining  the Bank Indonesia 7-Days Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRRR) at 5.75% from the beginning to the third  quarter of 2023, BI in October 2023 has raised  BI7DRRR by 25bps to 6.00%, the Deposit Facility rate by 25bps to 5.25%, and the Lending Facility rate by  25bps to 6.75 %.
The hike is aimed at strengthening  rupiah exchange rate stabilization policy against the impact of increasing global uncertainty, as well as pre-emptive and forward-looking measures to mitigate the impact on imported inflation, hence  inflation remains within the target corridor.
In  December 2023, BI changed the term BI7DRRR back to the BI Rate, but the amount will be maintained  at 6.00% taking into account the latest economic  conditions, especially with inflation still within target in the range of 2% - 4%. 262 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMANAGEMENTREpORTCOMpANYpROfILE MAIN HIGHLIGHTSMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS BANKING INDUSTRY ANALYSIS The overall performance of the banking industry (commercial banks)  continues to demonstrate positive developments, particularly in  supporting the national economy in 2023, both in terms of financing  (credit), raising funds, and earning profits.
Commercial bank intermediation recorded growth of 10.38% (yoy) to Rp7,090 trillion in  November 2023, with the highest growth occurring in working capital  loans of 10.05% and 12.26% (yoy) respectively.
This growth was supported by loose bank appetite and increasing demand for financing (credit)  in line with good corporate performance.
With this credit growth  achievement, the Loan to Deposits Ratio (LDR) position of commercial banks increased to a level of 84.78% as of November 2023.
By sector, credit growth according to Bank Indonesia (BI) is primarily  supported by the Business Services, Trade and Social Services sectors.
Sharia financing also continued to increase to 14.12% (yoy) in November  2023.
In the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) segment, credit growth reached 8.46% (yoy), supported by the Trade, Agriculture  and Social Services sectors.
New loan disbursement in December 2023 is indicated to increase  compared to November 2023 The results of the survey to banks indicate that the SBT on new loans disbursed in December 2023 was 73.3%, higher than 70.4% in the  previous month.
New loan disbursements in December 2023 were  indicated to increase in almost all types of loans.
The main factors influencing the expected increase in new loan disbursement are  financing demand from customers, the prospect of future monetary  and economic conditions, and the level of business competition from other banks.
Meanwhile, new loan disbursement is expected to slow  down for January 2024, affecting all categories of banks and all types  of loans.
The risk of lending as reflected in the ratio of Non-Performing Loans Gross (NPL gross) can be well controlled by commercial banks at  a safe level, which was at 2.36% as of November 2023.

Demand deposits were the largest contributor to third-party funds growth at 4.57% (yoy).
Moderated deposit  growth was partly due to increasing public consumption and increasing corporate investment needs after the lifting of the Covid-19 pandemic status, as well as other instruments that were better than banking products.
The liquidity in the banking industry as of the end of  2023 was generally at an adequate level with liquidity  ratios well above the level of supervisory needs.
The  ratio of Liquid Instruments/Non-Core Deposits (AL/NCD) and Liquid Instruments/Deposits (AL/DPK) were  127.07% and 28.73%, respectively, remained well  above the thresholds of 50% and 10% respectively.
Meanwhile, the Capital to Adequacy Ratio (CAR)  position of banks (commercial banks) continued to improve to a high level of 27.69%.
According to  OJK, the CAR position is far above the average CAR  of other countries which is below 20%.

The  IMF predicts the global economy to weaken in  2024 compared to 2023.
The IMF forecasts that the global economy would increase by 2.4% in 2024, down from the projected growth in 2023 of 3.0%.
The decline in global economic growth rate  is driven by a number of factors, including the  Chinese economy’s tendency to decelerate  due to weakening consumption and a property market crisis.
This scenario may have an impact on  Indonesia’s export performance, given that China  is one of its primary trading partners.
Furthermore, the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the  second half of 2023, as well as the ongoing Russia- Ukraine war, put strain on the global economy.
If such geopolitical concerns persist, they have the  ability to disrupt the global economy’s pace and to  cause increases in global oil and food prices, which will lead to an increase in inflation.
BUSINESS PROSPECT On the other hand, the global benchmark interest rate, which has increased throughout 2023, is  predicted to begin to decline in 2024, which is  also expected to be followed by a reduction in Bank Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate.
This will certainly have a positive impact on the Indonesian  economy, specifically on increasing demand for  bank loan.
Amidst global economic uncertainty, Indonesia’s  economy remains one of the resilient.
Bank Indonesia predicts economic growth in Indonesia  in 2024 in the 4.75%-5.5% range, supported by  monetary policy that is accommodative to stability and growth.
In 2024, consumption performance,  both private and governmental, and investment  are expected to continue to increase in line with strong public consumption patterns, the positive  impact of the elections, and the sustainability of  National Strategic Project (PSN) development.
Bank Mandiri’s business strategy in 2024 in 4 Focuses  can be further described as follows: 1.
Maintain credit growth in 2024 by fostering  principal growth in the long-term potential  sector, resilient/defensive sectors, and sector expertise to continue to increase Bank Mandiri’s  market share and dominance.  2.
Expand credit prudently by paying attention to the potential, capacity, and capability of  each segment to capture all derivative business potential in the wholesale customer business  ecosystem. 3.
Maintain adequate liquidity through sustainable growth of low-cost funds to ensure in keeping  low cost of funds through increased product holding, transaction optimization, and customer  acquisition.
Optimizing Fee Based Income growth as  a revenue driver by fostering recurring fee  growth and increasing intensification of existing  customers and focusing on top players in each industry group. 5.
Maintain optimal level of Coverage Ratio & Cost of Credit to anticipate credit quality decline by  maintaining coverage ratio. 6.
Effective cost management by reducing cost of funds and maintaining cost of credit at a low  level in order to achieve optimal returns. 282 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMANAGEMENTREpORTCOMpANYpROfILE MAIN HIGHLIGHTSMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS With maintained domestic economic stability,  the increasing role of bank intermediation is also  expected to continue.
Loan disbursement will  continue the positive trend with several driving sectors, such as the household sector, the trade  sector, and the manufacturing industry sector.
Deposit growth in the banking industry is also expected to grow healthily to ensure bank liquidity  to be maintained at an adequate ratio.
Bank Mandiri is therefore optimistic that its  performance will continue to grow sustainably  in 2024.
Bank Mandiri will perpetually refine its consistently implemented strategy.
We will focus on  maintaining dominance in the wholesale segment  and growing through an ecosystem-based value chain approach, while encouraging digital  platform optimization to strengthen the low-cost  fund base, and encouraging all branch networks and subsidiaries to recognize the exceptional  business opportunities in each region.
In addition, as a guideline in carrying out credit  expansion, Bank Mandiri has a tool in the form  of a Loan Portfolio Guideline (LPG) to identify  prospective sectors with low risk.
By growing according to LPG design, Bank Mandiri can expand  credit while maintaining improved credit quality.
Some sectors classified as prospective sectors include the Government sector, Food & Beverage  Industry, Telecommunications, Energy & Water,  Health Services, and processing industries related to the downstream mineral and coal program.
Seeing the increasingly massive digital development  in the community, Bank Mandiri continues to  optimize the collection of low-cost funds by  utilizing multi-transaction digital services that offer transactional convenience and flexibility through  Livin and KOPRA.
Bank Mandiri’s excellence in CASA  collection continues to be deepened with various innovations, new features and services from Livin and  KOPRA.

This was influenced  by, among others, an increase in loans and a  decrease in deposits from customer (demand deposits, Wadiah demand deposits, savings deposits,  and Wadiah savings deposits).
In the previous year,  Bank Mandiri posted net cash provided by operating activities of Rp99.98 trillion in 2022.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities Bank Mandiri posted net cash provided by investing activities of Rp16.01 trillion in 2023.
This was primarily  due to a decrease in government bonds other than  measured at fair value through profit and loss and divestment in associated entities.
In the previous  year, Bank Mandiri recorded net cash used for  investing activities of Rp41.89 trillion in 2022.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities Bank Mandiri posted net cash provided by financing activities of Rp23.47 trillion in 2023.

Meanwhile, from an external point of view, in relation to issued MTN and bonds, Moody’s and Fitch have set  Bank Mandiri a rating for the issuance of MTN in foreign currencies listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
On  the other hand, Pefindo has set ratings for Rupiah-denominated corporate bonds listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange as follows: Rating Agencies Rating Criteria Ratings International Rating Agency Moody's (as of March 2023)Long-Term Counterparty Risk Rating Baa2 Long-Term Deposit Baa2 Long-Term Debt Baa2 Fitch Ratings (as of February 2023)International Long-Term Rating BBB- National Long Term Rating AA+(idn) National Short-Term Rating F1+(idn) Standard & Poor's (as of December 2022) Issuer Credit Rating BBB-/STABLE/A-3 National Rating Agency PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (as of  February 2023)Long Term General Obligation idAAA The credibility of the rating can be proven by Bank  Mandiri’s ability to pay maturing bonds on time.
Short-Term Debt Repayment Ability  (Bank Liquidity) Bank Mandiri’s liquidity adequacy can be seen  from several indicators used to measure liquidity,  such as the minimum reserve requirement ratio,  macroprudential liquidity buffer, liquidity reserves, macroprudential intermediation ratio (MIR), liquidity  coverage ratio (LCR), and Net Stable Funding ratio  (NSFR).
• The reserve requirement is set by the central  bank based on the percentage of third-party funds collected by banks, which must be  maintained by banks in current accounts at BI.
• Bank Mandiri has a limit in the form of a safety  level limit, which is a projection of liquidity reserves for the next month.
At the end of  December 2023, Bank Mandiri’s liquidity reserves  are above the safety level.
• RIM is a ratio of the results of a comparison  between loans and corporate securities that  meet certain requirements held against deposits, securities that meet certain requirements  issued by banks, and loans that meet certain  requirements.
• LCR is the ratio between High Quality Liquid  Assets (HQLA) and estimated total net cash  outflow for the next 30 days in a crisis scenario.
LCR aims to improve banks’ short-term liquidity  resilience in crisis conditions.
Regulators who set  LCR compliance at least 100%.
• NSFR is a comparative ratio between available  stable funding and required stable funding.
The regulator that sets the NSFR fulfillment is the lowest 100%. 396 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMANAGEMENTREpORTCOMpANYpROfILE MAIN HIGHLIGHTSMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LAPORAN LABA RUGI DAN PENGHASILAN KOMPREHENSIF LAIN KONSOLIDASIAN The achievements of the ratios mentioned above are as follows: Liquidity 2023 2022 2021 Rupiah reserve requirement 7.32% 8.53% 3.97% Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (MIR) 83.73% 75.98% 78.35% Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 176.24% 191.02% 200.56% Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 116.59% 119.93% 126.20% Long-Term Debt Repayment Ability  (Bank Solvency) Bank Mandiri Capital Adequacy Ratio or CAR  (Bank Only) reached 21.48% in December 2023,  higher than the CAR ratio for the same period the  previous year of 19.46%.
This ratio indicates that Bank Mandiri’s solvency remains positive as it has  exceeded the minimum CAR ratio requirement  from the Regulator, enabling the Bank to meet credit risk, market risk and operational risk Bank Mandiri projects its liquidity position in the  future through the liquidity gap methodology,  which is a maturity mismatch between asset  and liability components (including off balance sheets), which is arranged into time buckets based  on contractual maturity or behavioral maturity.
For the next 12 months, Bank Mandiri estimates  liquidity conditions to be in a surplus position.
However, alternative funding if market liquidity conditions become tight or not in accordance  with predictions is still prepared by the Bank.
In addition, Bank Mandiri also conducts periodic  liquidity risk stress-testing in order to determine the  impact of changes in market factors and internal factors in extreme conditions (crisis) on liquidity  conditions.
Bank Mandiri reported that the Bank  was able to survive the liquidity crisis based on the results of the stress-testing.
In addition to stress- testing, the Bank also has a Liquidity Contingency  Plan (LCP) that regulates funding strategies and pricing strategies in crisis conditions, including  money market loans, repos, bilateral loans, FX  swaps and wholesale funding.
In the LCP, the Bank determines liquidity conditions and funding  strategies by considering internal and external  conditions. 397 ANNUAL REPORT 2023CORPORATE GOVERNANCEESG COMMITMENTS& PRACTICESSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTALRESPONSIBILITYFINANCIALSTATEMENTS 2023   Debt Payment Ability from Issued  Securities Bank Mandiri has issued debt securities or corporate  bonds denominated in Rupiah listed on the Indonesia  Stock Exchange.
The Bank also issues debt securities  denominated in foreign currencies (US Dollars) in the form of global bonds listed on the Singapore  Stock Exchange and offered to investors outside the  United States subject to Regulation S under the US Securities Act.
The issued securities have been rated by the rating  agency and will be periodically reassessed until  the debt securities mature.
The quality of securities  is largely determined by the ability of the issuing company to pay securities at maturity and the ability  to pay interest or coupons during the term of issuance  of the securities.
The structure of debt securities issued by Bank Mandiri  both in Rupiah and foreign currencies with the rating  of debt securities has been explained in the financial review section of the issued securities.
The meaning  of the rating that has been determined by the rating  agency is as follows: Earnings Bank Mandiri uses Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Net Interest Income Margin (NIM),  Operating Expenses to Operating Income (BOPO),  and Cost Efficiency Ratio (CER) to determine the Bank’s earnings performance.
The Bank’s  achievements related to these ratios in September  2023 are as follows Profitability  2023 2022 2021 Return on Assets (ROA) 4.03% 3.30% 2.53% Return on Equity (ROE, Avg Tier 1 Capital) 27.31% 22.62% 16.24% Net Interest Margin (NIM) 5.25% 5.16% 4.73% Operating Expenses to Operating Income (BOPO) 51.88% 57.35% 67.26% Cost Efficiency Ratio (CER) 35.08% 38.90% 44.89% Cost to Income Ratio (CIR) 34.36% 38.16% 42.50% The achievement of ROE (Avg Tier 1 Capital) and ROA ratios of 27.31% and 4.03% respectively in December 2023 was supported by operational efficiency reflected by BOPO and CIR ratios of 51.88% and 34.31% respectively in December 2023.
Meanwhile, the Bank’s NIM ratio reached 5.25% in December 2023, up from 5.15% in the  same period the previous year.
SOLVENCY AND RECEIVABLES COLLECTIBILITY  398 PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMANAGEMENTREpORTCOMpANYpROfILE MAIN HIGHLIGHTSMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Indonesia’s economy appears to be growing stronger  until the end of 2023.
Bank Mandiri took advantage  of the momentum of economic improvement while  contributing directly to the Indonesian economy by disbursing loans.
Amidst such loan expansion, the  Bank always prioritizes the principle of prudence  in loan management.
One indication of improved loans management is the achievement of the NPL  (Gross) ratio of 1.02% in December 2023, lower than  the same period the previous year of 1.88%.
Net NPL ratio was also relatively controlled at 0.29% in  December 2023 compared to 0.26% in December  2022.
This improvement in the NPL ratio has a positive impact on Bank Mandiri’s loans collectability  profile and reduces the expenses of allowance for  impairment losses.
Bank Mandiri has standard procedures in loans  management from beginning to end.
For the wholesale segment, Bank Mandiri begins the loans  management process by determining the target  market through the Loan Portfolio Guideline which establishes the Industry Classification (attractive,  neutral, selective) and Industry Limit in accordance  with the Bank’s appetite, as well as selecting and screening target customers through Industry Acceptance Criteria and Name Clearance, to produce a pipeline of qualified debtors.
This  process is continued with a credit risk assessment  using a series of credit risk tools (credit risk rating, spreadsheet, CPA, NAK, and so forth), which is then  taken a decision by the Credit Approver Authority  Holder (through a Credit Committee Meeting) with a four-eyes principle involving the Business Unit and  Credit Risk Management Unit independently.
Meanwhile, for the retail or mass market segment,  the loan management process is carried out more  automatically using a credit risk scorecard, by referring to the Risk Acceptance Criteria of each  product, and processed through an automated  work-flow (loan factory).
Furthermore, for the credit monitoring process,  Bank Mandiri applies the Portfolio Quality Review mechanism based on the credit portfolio.
This  process is followed by collection and recovery for  non-performing parts of the portfolio.
The Bank also conducts what-if analysis of wholesale and retail  portfolios through a stress testing process using  certain macroeconomic scenarios to anticipate worsening macroeconomic conditions.
Receivables Collectability  The receivables collectability is measured by the efficient payment of lending.
Bank Mandiri reported the receivables collectability from lending activities (banks only) as follows: Category 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Current 1,027,406,545 874,645,487 764,469,150 701,951,159 734,848,329  Special Mention 47,381,346 40,549 ,922 40,525 ,825 36,796 ,337 38,663 ,525  Substandard 2,289,310 1,280 ,514 1,913 ,657 2,065 ,985 3,372 ,638  Doubtful 4,322,560 5,402 ,034 4,369 ,540 938,038 3,533 ,071  Loss 4,387,666 10,761 ,094 16,835 ,691 21,851 ,897 11,933 ,553  Total Loans 1,085,787,427 932,639,051 828,113,863 763,603,416 792,351,116  NPL gross*) 10,999,536 17,443 ,642 23,118 ,888 24,855 ,920 18,839 ,262  NPL (%) 1.02% 1.88% 2.81% 3.29% 2.39% *) NPL ratio is calculated excluding Loans to Other BanksSOLVENCY AND RECEIVABLES COLLECTIBILITY  399 ANNUAL REPORT 2023CORPORATE GOVERNANCEESG COMMITMENTS& PRACTICESSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTALRESPONSIBILITYFINANCIALSTATEMENTS 2023   MANAGEMENT POLICY ON  CAPITAL STRUCTURE Bank Mandiri’s capital policy is prudently to meet  regulatory capital requirements, diversify capital  sources to anticipate long-term strategic plans and  allocate capital efficiently to business segments that have the potential to provide an optimal risk-return  profile, including placement and participation  in Subsidiaries in order to meet stakeholder expectations including investors and regulators.
Bank Mandiri ensures that it has sufficient capital  to be able to meet credit risk, market risk and  operational risk, both in supporting business growth  under normal conditions and to anticipate stressful conditions.
In calculating the capital adequacy, Bank Mandiri  refers to the provisions of the Financial Services  Authority (OJK) including the following: • POJK No. 27 of 2022 dated 28 December 2022 on the Second Amendment to POJK  11/POJK.03/2016 concerning the Capital  Adequacy Ratio for Commercial Banks.
• POJK No. 34/POJK.03/2016 dated 22  September 2016 on Amendments to POJK CAPITAL STRUCTURE No. 11/POJK.03/2016 concerning the Capital  Adequacy Ratio for Commercial Banks.
• SEOJK No. 26/SEOJK.03/2016 on the Capital Adequacy Ratio in accordance with Risk Profile and Fulfillment of Capital Equivalency  maintained assets.
For the calculation of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), Bank Mandiri applies the Standardized Approach  which refers to Basel III Reforms (Standardized Approach) for Credit Risk effective from January  2023.
For Market Risk, the Bank applies the Basel  II Standard Measurement Method and internally applies Value at Risk.
For Operational Risk, the Bank  refers to the Standardized Approach under Basel III  Reforms effective from January 2023.
The Bank’s consolidated capital adequacy ratios as  of 31 December 2023 and 2022, taking into account credit, operational and market risks, were 21.99%  and 19.65%, respectively, by calculating credit and  operational risks of 22.21% and 19.75%, respectively.
The tables below describe the results of the RWA  calculation (Credit, Operational, and Market) as well as the Capital Adequacy Ratio for the positions  of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 for  Bank Mandiri only.

Nevertheless, sustainable infrastructure development will have a positive  impact on the Indonesian economy gradually in  the medium to long term.
In addition, government policies to downstream various commodities are  expected to increase added value for these  commodities while strengthening the Indonesian economy.
The achievement of the economic  target next year is also driven by the effectiveness of  government expenditure realization.

Moreover, Bank Indonesia forecasts that Indonesia’s  economy will continue to improve on the back of  increasing private consumption and investment, strong exports and maintained public purchasing  power amidst rising inflation.
Various indicators  and results of the latest Bank Indonesia survey, such as consumer confidence, retail sales, and the  Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)  indicate the ongoing process of domestic economic recovery.
Bank Indonesia estimates economic  growth in 2022 to be biased upwards within BI’s  projection range of 4.5-5.3% with estimated growth in lending/financing of around 10-12% in 2023.
Bank Indonesia also projects the value of Electronic  Money (EM) transactions in 2023 to grow 25.7% or  reach Rp508 trillion.
Meanwhile, the value of digital  banking transactions is estimated to increase by 27.2% to reach Rp67,600 trillion in 2023.
