Throughout 2022, the Indonesian economy saw impressive  growth.
This condition was helped by the increasingly  controlled COVID-19 pandemic.
The trend in COVID-19  cases and deaths continued to show a decline, with many  countries in the world introducing minimal restrictions.
At  the domestic level, Indonesia continued to prepare for the  transition from a pandemic to an endemic.
Overall, the economy in 2022 grew 5.31%, higher than 3.70%  in 2021.
Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency  (BPS), Indonesia’s economy in 1Q22 compared to 1Q21 grew  5.01% (year on year/y-on-y), while for the previous quarter  (4Q21) it contracted by 0.96% (quarter on quarter/q-on-q).
For the second quarter (2Q22), the Indonesian economy  grew 5.44% (y-on-y) in 2Q21, and 3.72% (q-to-q) in 1Q22.
In  the third quarter (3Q22), Indonesia’s economy in 3Q21 grew  5.72% (y-on-y), and 1.81% compared to 2Q22 (q-on-q).

The Company’s performance is predicted to continue  to improve with the completion of the electric furnace  4 rebuild in 2022, which will increase the Company’s  production in Sorowako Blok.
In addition, PT Vale has also  started a number of development projects in the Bahodopi  Block and Pomalaa Block.
The continued growth in the Indonesian economy during  2022 has reassured investors of the economic fundamentals.
Based on the Ministry of Investment/Investment  Coordinating Board (BKPM) publication, investment  realization in 2022 reached Rp1,207 .2 trillion, or 0.6% higher  than Rp1,200 trillion target.
For PT Vale, Indonesia’s maintained economic growth had a  positive influence on its realization of business development  plans and sustainable mining operations, in line with the  B20 priority to ensure a fair and orderly energy transition.
In line with the joint efforts to reduce carbon emissions  from fossil fuels and support the energy transition towards  the use of new and renewable energy (EBT), nickel has the  potential to become one of the strategic commodities in the  future.
Indonesia believes it can play an important role in  the world’s nickel supply chain, given Indonesia’s large nickel  reserves and nickel supply potential.
Based on the Woodmac report for the December 2022  period, Indonesia’s total nickel supply to the world market  is approximately 1.5 million tons, while the world’s total  demand for nickel is around 3.1 million tons.
Indonesia’s  nickel mining areas are spread across seven provinces,  namely Maluku, North Maluku, Papua, West Papua, South  Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi.
The large nickel potential in Indonesia prompted the  Government of Indonesia to enact the downstreaming  of the domestic nickel industry, and to impose a ban on  nickel ore exports from January 1, 2020 through Minister  of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 11 of 2019.
During the reporting period, the nickel ore export ban policy  was declared to have violated the provisions of the World  Trade Organization (WTO), and for this decision Indonesia is  seeking an appeal.
Even though there was a decision from the WTO, the  Government of Indonesia stated that it would continue  to push for the acceleration of the downstreaming of the  domestic nickel industry, as it would have a positive impact  on the economy.
The steps taken included increasing the  number of processing and refining factories (smelters).
Based on the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry’s Daily  Energy and Mineral Strategy Information Review, there are  currently 15 nickel smelters throughout Indonesia, and it is  planned to have 7 additional smelters in the next few years.
PT Vale will build three processing plants, which are 1 smelter  and 2 HPAL plants with a total investment more than US$9  billion or around Rp141.9 trillion (using the Bank Indonesia  exchange rate as of December 30, 2022 of Rp15,592/US$).
The three projects will include the Morowali Project (US$2.6  billion), the Pomalaa Project (US$4.5 billion), and the Sorowako  Limonite Project (US$2.0 billion).
The new smelters and HPAL plants in Indonesia will increase  Indonesia’s processed nickel production to global market  in the form of Ferro Nickel (FeNi), Nickel Pig Iron (NPI), and  Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP).
The increased supply of  processed nickel products will continue to be absorbed by  the market, both domestically and overseas mainly due to  the needs of stainless steel and the development of electric  vehicles that use batteries containing nickel.
Domestically, the Government issued Presidential Regulation  Number 55 of 2019 concerning the Acceleration of the Battery  Electric Vehicle (BEV) Program for Road Transportation.
In addition, the National Industrial Development Plan  (RIPIN) prioritizes the development of the automotive  industry for the period 2020 – 2035 through development  of electric vehicles and their main components such as  batteries, electric motors and inverters.
The Government's  BEV production target for 2030 is 600 thousand 4-wheel  or more vehicles, and 2.45 million 2-wheel vehicles, while  electric vehicle production is 400 thousand units in 2025 and  5.7 million units in 2035. 2022 Annual Report 91 Berdasarkan laporan Badan Energi Internasional (IEA) dalam  Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2022, selama periode 2020  – 2040 permintaan nikel untuk keperluan teknologi energi  bersih akan berkembang pesat sampai 20 kali lipat.
Based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) report in the  Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2022, for the period 2020  – 2040 the demand for nickel for clean energy technology  needs will grow rapidly by up to 20 times.
Likewise, in  the report by Wood Mackenzie, a global energy analysis  institute, submitted by the Indonesian Nickel Mining  Association (APNI), world nickel consumption for electric  vehicles and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in 2020  is estimated to still be below 200 thousand tons per year,  and will increase to above 300 thousand tons per year in  2026, up to 550 thousand tons per year in 2030.
The economic improvement in 2022 will ensure that the level  of demand for nickel is maintained, although supplies will not  always be available, especially for class 1 nickel.
During 2022, the  highest nickel supply on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was  recorded at 101,256 tons on January 4, 2022 and the lowest was  49,470 tons on November 21, 2022.
This maintained supply and  demand resulted in relatively stable nickel price movements on  the LME throughout 2022, with a lowest price of US$19,100 per  ton on July 15, 2022 and a highest price of US$48,241 per ton on  March 10, 2022.

The highest production was recorded in the third  quarter with 17,513 tons, and the lowest was in the second  quarter with 12,567 tons.
Nickel in matte production in 2022  was lower than 2021 production mainly due to the execution of  Electric Furnace 4 rebuild project in the first half of 2022 (1H22).
Nickel Mining and Processing Business Segment Sales  and Revenue The nickel mining and processing business segment sales  performance is determined based on revenue in the fiscal  year, from the sales of nickel matte to VCL and SMM.
The  Company also sets a revenue target for the following year.
The Company's sales are made under long-term, “must take”  US dollar-denominated sales contracts.
