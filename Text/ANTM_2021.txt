REVIEW OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE The following management discussion and analysis  is prepared based on information obtained from the  Consolidated Financial Statements of PT Aneka Tambang  Tbk and Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2021, that  have been audited by the Public Accountant Firm of  Tanudiredja, Wibisana, Rintis & Partner, member firm of  PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited, with a fair  opinion, on all material respects, the consolidated financial  position of PT Aneka Tambang Tbk and Subsidiaries as  at December 31, 2021, and the consolidated financial  performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in  accordance with the Indonesian Financial Accounting  Standards.
Throughout 2021, due to its business activities, the  Company faces market risk factors (including price  www.
The Company establishes an overall risk  management program in an effort to minimize the  negative impact of unpredictable financial markets on the  Company’s financial performance.
Risk identification is managed by the Enterprise Risk  Management (“ERM”) unit which has direct responsibility  to the Board of Directors.
The ERM work unit is tasked  with identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing  key risks to protect business sustainability in the long  term and minimize unforeseen impacts on the Company’s  financial performance.
In addition, as part of the Board of Commissioners’  organs, the Risk Management Committee has the role  and responsibility to assist the Board of Commissioners in  providing professional and independent opinions to ensure  the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management  implementation.
Some of the key risk factors in 2021 are: 1.
Commodity price risk  Fluctuations in global commodity prices (nickel, gold  and bauxite) also affect the Company’s profit/loss  performance, particularly the movement of international  nickel prices (LME – London Market Exchange) which is  directly related to the recording of the Company’s trade  receivables arising from the sale of its main commodities,  namely ferronickel and nickel ore.   2.
Currency and interest rate risk  In terms of currency risk, a portion of the Company’s  revenue and cash position is denominated in  United States Dollars as global commodity prices  are determined in that currency.
Almost all of the  Company’s operating expenses are recorded in Rupiah,  except for the purchase of precious metals.
ANTAM’s  capital structure is mostly derived from equity in  Rupiah.
However, the Company remains exposed to the  risk of a weakening of the Rupiah against the United  States Dollar, considering that most of the Company’s  loans are in the form of United States Dollars.
In relation to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed  to cash flow interest rate risk on loans with floating  interest rates.
The Company always analyzes interest  rate exposure dynamically.
Various scenarios were  www.

Based on this scenario, the Company  calculates the profit or loss impact of interest rate  movements. 3.
Credit risk  Credit risk is related to the Company’s risk of exposure  to losses incurred by customers’ or third parties’  failure to fulfil their contractual obligations.
In 2021,  there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Company manages and controls this credit risk  by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to  accept for individual customers and by monitoring  exposures in relation to such limits.
The Company is confident in their ability to continue to  control and maintain minimal exposure to credit risk,  since the Company’s cash in bank and time deposits  are placed in reputable banks and the Company has  clear policies on the selection of customers and legally  binding agreements in place for mineral commodity  sales transactions.
The Company’s general policy for mineral commodity  sales to new and existing customers is to select  customers having strong financial condition and good  reputation.
To minimise default risk, the Company  utilises L/C facility for ferronickel, nickel ore, and  bauxite sales where the amounts of L/C issued by the  customers prior to goods shipment by the Company  cover the majority of sales amount. 4.
Liquidity Risk   The Company’s objectives when managing capital  are to safeguard their ability to continue as a going  concern in order to provide returns for shareholders  and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an  optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust their capital structure,  the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid  to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to  www.
Consistent with other entities in the industry, the  Company monitors capital on the basis of the debt- to-equity ratio.
This ratio is calculated as total debt  divided by total capital.
Debt is calculated as total  liabilities as shown in consolidated statements of  financial position.
Total capital is equity as shown in  consolidated statements of financial position.
The  Company maintains to keep its debt-to-equity ratio not  to exceed 2:1. 5.
Fair value estimation  Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be  exchanged or liability settled between knowledgeable  and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
Management considers that the carrying amounts  of current financial assets and financial liabilities  recorded at amortised cost in the consolidated  financial statements approximate their fair values  because of their short term maturities. 6.
Impact from COVID-19 Pandemic  The COVID-19 pandemic did not have significant  impact to the Company’s financial performance  during the year.
The Company was able to run its  operations without significant hurdles caused by the  pandemic.
It surely needed to make some adjustments  to its several operational procedures to adhere to the  applicable health protocol and ensure optimum and  safe operations for its employees and customers.
Regarding the medium and long-term impacts of  the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in significant  uncertainties in the future.
The medium and long-term  impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operations  and financial performance are therefore difficult to  predict at this moment.
The Company will continue  to monitor this matter and take necessary steps to  minimize the impact of related risks and uncertainties  related to it in the future.
