Annual Report 2023  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk116 Three Bussiness Pillars Tiga Pilar BisnisManagement  Discussion and AnalysisDiskusi dan Analisis Manajemen  Business and Operations  Review PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk (AEI) achieved historical  high operational performance in FY23.
Production volume  in FY23 reached 65.88 Mt, corresponding to a 5% increase  year-on-year (y-o-y).
FY23 sales volume of 65.71 Mt was  7% higher than FY22 and surpassed the company’s sales  volume target of 62 – 64 Mt.
We recorded a 22% increase  in overburden removal to 286.35 Mbcm which led to a strip  ratio of 4.35x, 16% higher than in FY22 and higher than our guidance.
Sales of metallurgical coal through subsidiary PT Adaro  Minerals Indonesia Tbk increased by 39% to 4.46 Mt in FY23, exceeding our FY23 sales volume target of 3.8 – 4.3 Mt.
Our metallurgical coal product continues to be well received by  the market, and our customers are spread throughout key  steel producing countries in Asia.
Despite the increase in sales volume, our revenue declined  by 20% to $6,518 million as our average selling price (ASP) was 26% lower due to declining coal prices.
Lower ASP and  higher costs affected our profitability, and core earnings  declined 38% y-o-y to $1,873 million.

AEI achieved historical high production and sales volume surpassing our  initial guidance.
Production volume increased 5% to 65.88  Mt and sales volume increased 7% to 65.71 Mt.
Our main producing asset is PT Adaro Indonesia (AI),  which represented 74% of AEI’s total production volume.
The rest were from Balangan Coal Companies (Balangan),  PT Mustika Indah Permai (MIP), and PT Adaro Minerals  Indonesia Tbk (AMI).
AI, Balangan and MIP produce medium  calorific value thermal coal with low pollutant content  widely used by coal-fired power plants.
AMI produces hard coking coal used as raw material in the production of steel.
Balangan’s production volume increased 13% to 8.02 Mt,  MIP’s production volume increased 27% to 4.15 Mt, and  metallurgical coal production from AMI increased 52% to  5.11 Mt, representing 7% of AEI’s production.

Our strategy to diversify and expand  our business across the three pillars will create a strong  foundation to be a more sustainable company in addition to delivering more profitable growth over the long run.
All three pillars – Adaro Energy, Adaro Minerals, and Adaro  Green, made notable achievements in their operations and  business development in 2023.
The Adaro Energy pillar, our main operating pillar, comprises of business along  the pit-to-power vertically integrated energy supply chain.
Going forward, we expect a solid outlook for the thermal  coal market as demand from Indonesia and the seaborne  market remains solid while supply side lagged due to  underinvestment and lack of asset development.

We will also develop other  businesses as part of our green initiatives such as water  treatment and forestry for carbon capture and ecosystem  restoration.
In the Adaro Minerals pillar, metallurgical coal production  and sales volume also increased in 2023.
The long-term  market outlook for metallurgical coal remains intact.
Supply growth remains challenged by underinvestment  and limited greenfield projects.
Under the Adaro Minerals  pillar we also have an aluminium smelter that is currently  under construction.
The widespread use of aluminum  across various sectors, such as automotive, construction,  packaging, and aerospace will continue to support  aluminium demand.
Adaro Green pillar kickstarted its renewable energy venture  and did the groundbreaking for PT Kayan Hydropower  Nusantara’s 1,375 MW hydropower project in March.
This  project will play a key role in supporting the downstream  processing of minerals using clean energy.
The advent of  green economy is expected to support the demand for green  minerals products and the Adaro Group is well positioned to capture these development opportunities.
Company Guidance and  Prospect in 2024 Growth in the global economy is expected to continue to  support the demand for our products, and thus we expect  sales volume to grow to 65 Mt – 67 Mt in FY24, consisting  of 61 Mt to 62 Mt of thermal coal, and 4.9 Mt to 5.4 Mt of  metallurgical coal from AMI.
Our metallurgical coal product  continues to be well received by the market and we expect  demand continues to be strong.
Strip ratio target for FY24  is 4.3x, relatively flat compared to FY23 and around the  average life-of-mine strip ratio.
Annual Report 2023  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk120 Three Bussiness Pillars Tiga Pilar BisnisWe estimate capital expenditure in FY24 to be in the range  of $600 million – $700 million.
This capex is allocated for  routine capex, infrastructure expansion, as well as our  equity investments in projects related to the industrial park  in North Kalimantan.
Our key project in the industrial park,  a 500,000 tpa aluminium smelter, achieved financial close  in 2023 and has started construction.

Information on Investment,  Expansion, Divestment, and Others AEI’s business has expanded rapidly and despite the  significance of our thermal coal operations to profitability,  the contribution of metallurgical coal continues to increase.
In FY23, revenue from metallurgical coal accounted for 17% of AEI’s revenue.
We expect the contribution of metallurgical  coal to continue increase along with the increase in sales  volume from AMI.
AMI, through PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI), is  developing an aluminium smelter in the North Kalimantan Industrial Park.
This is in line with the Group’s commitment  to actively participate in government programs related to  the processing of minerals to reduce Indonesia’s aluminium  imports and create an industry ecosystem for electric  vehicles and batteries.
Annual Report 2023  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk122 Three Bussiness Pillars Tiga Pilar BisnisIn March 2023, AEI broke ground at our flagship hydropower  project in North Kalimantan under PT Kayan Hydropower  Nusantara (KHN).
President Joko Widodo attended the  event along with AEI’s President Director, Mr.
AEI, through PT Mentarang Tirta Energi, holds 50%  ownership in KHN.
KHN will develop the Mentarang Induk  hydro power plant (1,375 MW) which will provide clean  energy source to the North Kalimantan Industrial Park.
As stated by President Joko Widodo during the groundbreaking  ceremony, the government fully supports Indonesia’s  economic transformation plans towards green economy,  one of which is through the development of the Mentarang Induk hydro power plant.
In May 2023, PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry (KAI) –  a subsidiary of AMI, was able to secure financing for the  development of its aluminum smelter project with a capacity  of 500,000 tpa.
In 2023, KAI completed soil investigation,  land levelling, and piling work for the baking furnace  facilities in the aluminum smelter area.
This business model  allows us to be more efficient while at the same time  creating business opportunities for the entire business  pillars and values for shareholders.
Our business is still  dominated by coal mining and trading and revenue from  this segment accounted for 97% of AEI’s revenue in FY23.
Our revenue stream from mining has become more diverse  as revenue from metallurgical coal grows.
Metallurgical  coal contributed 17% of AEI’s revenue in FY23, and we  expect contribution from metallurgical coal to increase along with AMI’s volume growth and sustained strong  metallurgical coal price.

This increment in  operational results balanced the 26% decline in the ASP  as coal prices declined from the record high levels in FY22.
Increasing metallurgical coal volume from our subsidiary  AMI and the strong metallurgical coal price, have  supported the portion of revenue from metallurgical coal.
In FY23, revenue from metallurgical coal accounted for  approximately 17% of AEI’s revenue.
Revenue portion from  metallurgical coal is expected to continue increasing as  volume from AMI continues to grow to reach 6 Mtpa in 2025.
Cost of Revenue Cost of revenues increased by 15% y-o-y to $3,980 million,  mainly due to increased royalty expenses for PT Adaro  Indonesia (AI) compared to a year ago period.
Mining costs  and processing costs also increased, driven by higher  volume.
We recorded a 22% increase in overburden removal  to 286.35 Mbcm, and a strip ratio of 4.35x, 16% higher than  in FY22 and our guidance, but still within our life-of-mine  strip ratio.
While our total fuel consumption increased by 14%, our fuel  cost for FY23 remained unchanged from FY22 as oil prices  declined.
Coal cash cost per tonne (excluding royalty) in  FY23 increased by 6% from FY22.

Royalties to the Government and Income Tax Expense Royalties to the Government increased 19% to $1,466  million from $1,230 million, while income tax expenses  decreased 73% to $439 million from $1,645 million.
After AI  was granted the IUPK-KOP in September of 2022, starting  from January 1, 2023, it began to implement the provision  on taxation and non-tax revenue (PNBP) in accordance with the prevailing regulations.
The IUPK-KOP has increased AI’s royalty rate to the range  of 14% to 28%, from the previous 13.5%.
However, the  corporate income tax rate decreased from 45% to 22%.
The  IUPK-KOP has also brought about other changes to AI’s  business, such as non-tax state revenue (PNBP) for central  government and local government’s portion in accordance  with the provisions of laws and regulations.
AI accounted for 74% of the Adaro Group’s production in FY23.
Operational EBITDA, Core Earnings, and Net Profit AEI’s operational EBITDA declined by 49% y-o-y to $2,554  million and core earnings declined by 38% to $1,873 million  for FY23, on the back of lower ASP and higher costs.
Our  operational EBITDA margin in FY23 remained healthy at  39%.
Net profit for the period of $1,855 million already  accounted for the non-tax state revenue (PNBP) for central  government (4% portion) and local government (6% portion).
In the Adaro Group, we use operational EBITDA as the  primary metric to measure our operating performance.
We  believe it is useful for analysts and investors to compare  and evaluate our operational performance without regard  to capital structure or other non-operational items.
Our underlying core earnings in FY23 declined 38% to  $1,873 million.
Our core earnings exclude non-operational  items net of tax, which reflects the quality performance of  our core business and operational excellence.

Total Liabilities Total liabilities at the end of FY23 were $3,064 million,  28% lower compared to the same period last year.
Current  liabilities decreased by 13% y-o-y to $2,135 million mainly  due to the 92% decline in corporate income tax payable,  which was offset by the reclassification of AI’s senior notes  as current liabilities because of its near-term maturity in  October 2024, and the 57% increase in accrued expenses  as a result of the changes in government regulations  – mainly due to the non-tax state revenue (PNBP) for  central government (4% portion) and local government (6%  portion).
Non-current liabilities decreased by 49% y-o-y to  $929 million due to voluntary repayment of AI’s bank loan  amounting to $196 million.
The management is of the opinion that these changes are in  line with operational growth as well as market development  and have a positive impact on the company’s financial  position in the current year.
