Selain itu, pandemi COVID-19 juga turut mendorong  meningkatnya harga komoditas dunia, khususnya Global Economic Analysis Global economic conditions in 2021 are still  shrouded in uncertainty caused by the COVID-19  pandemic, which has not shown any signs of ending.
Governments worldwide are trying to implement  extraordinary measures to save their citizens  and economies from the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic.
However, the Coronavirus that continues to mutate  makes handling more complex so that the third  and fourth waves appear in 2021.
This has made  economic conditions that had gradually returned to  normal in line with the massive vaccination program  being carried out, filled with uncertainty again.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its  projections for global economic growth in 2021 with  a downward trend.
Finally, in the World Economic  Outlook report released in January 2022, the IMF  predicts global economic growth will reach 5.9%, it  is similar with the prediction of the World Economic  Outlook report released in July 2021.
However, it is  still 0.1% lower that what World Economic Outlook’s  prediction, published July 2021.
In line with the Company’s vision  to become a world-class energy  company, Bukit Asam continues  to be committed to increasing  added value for the Company,  shareholders, and all stakeholders  of the Company.
especially food commodities.
This is due to logistical  delays due to the lockdown policies adopted by  many countries.
The year 2021 was also marked by an energy crisis,  one of which was caused by soaring world coal  prices, which resulted in delays in the production  process of goods, which made the average world  price of goods experience a relatively high spike.
This makes the inflation rate in the world in general  experience a relatively high increase in 2021.
Another risk looming over the world economy is  a change in the direction of monetary policy.
The  economic recovery made central banks in various  countries withdraw stimulus and impose tight  monetary policies.
Indonesian Economic Analysis The COVID-19 pandemic is also a significant  challenge for the Indonesian economy.
Although the  Government has implemented a massive vaccination  program, the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia has  experienced a very high spike.
The Government  takes various policies to save the citizens and the  economy.
One of the policies taken by the Government and  proven effective in dealing with the COVID-19  pandemic is Enforcement of Community Activity  Restrictions (PPKM).
This policy has proven to  produce outstanding results so that the spread of  COVID-19 can be suppressed very significantly.
In line with the implementation of PPKM, the  Government has also issued several large-scale fiscal  stimulus packages through the National Economic  Recovery Program (PEN) in terms of the government  budget that is intended to reduce the negative  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PEN program is a form of policy response  taken by the Government to maintain and prevent  business activities from further deteriorating, reduce  the number of layoffs by providing credit interest  subsidies for affected micro, small, and medium  business debtors, accelerate national economic  recovery, and to support state financial policies.
The Government not only disburses support funds  from the public demand side but also opens the  demand valve, including supporting financing for  MSMEs by providing a credit interest subsidy stimulus  so that the MSME sector can move again.
The  Government is also trying to increase consumption in  the form of social assistance, there is also a stimulus  for easing PPnBM, and a VAT stimulus, to encourage  people’s purchases power.
Through these various policies, the Indonesian  economy grew better in 2021.
According to the  Central Statistics Agency (BPS) data, Indonesia’s  economy will grow 3.69% in 2021.
This growth was  much better than the previous year, where the  Indonesian economy contracted 2.07%.
However,  compared to the era before the pandemic, national  economic growth has not yet returned.
The Government is also able to keep inflation at a low  level.
Based on BPS data, the inflation rate in 2021  reached 1.87%.
This prevents the national economy  from experiencing significant fluctuations even  though the wheels of the economy are still turning  slower than average conditions.
Indonesia’s trade balance in 2021 also recorded a  reasonably good surplus, amounting to USD35.34  billion, far higher than the previous year’s USD21.74  billion.
Such surplus was also the highest for the  last 15 years or since 2006 when the surplus was  recorded at USD 39.37 billion.
The Indonesian economy is predicted to grow better  in 2022.
The Ministry of Finance and the World Bank  forecast that the national economy will increase to  a range of 4.8% to 5.5% in 2022.
In addition, Bank  Indonesia (BI) will continue until 2022.
This prediction is undoubtedly driven by reduced  uncertainty and the assumption that vaccine launches  reach a critical mass of the population in the fourth  quarter of 2021 and is in line with expectations of  global economic recovery, as well as movements in  other components such as household consumption,  government consumption, investment, to exports  and imports.
Coal Industry Analysis In 2021, the process of global economic recovery  from the relatively immediate impact of the COVID-19  pandemic was marked by an energy crisis.
The price  of coal and gas, the world’s primary energy sources,  has soared significantly.
This is due to the lack of  coal and gas supplies due to the lockdown policies  implemented in many countries.
In addition, cold  weather and heavy rainfall also affect the world’s  coal production.
The high demand for coal and the limited availability  of alternative fuels made the price of coal on the  ICE Newcastle exchange experience a bullish trend  in 2021.
The world coal price itself experienced a  significant strengthening in 2021, recorded for the  average world price of coal, the Newcastle GAR  Index of 6,322 at the price USD222/ton and Index  ICI-3 on USD180/ton on October 2021. 71,11  65,57 60,71 70,19 77,94 84,48  93,80 104,94  117,22 180.84  115,42 98,38  75,84  87,79 84,47  86,68 100,33 115,35  130,99 150,03  161,63 215,01  159,79  89,74 86,17  85,50 94,41  93,29 106,02  127,68 149,99 171,44  181,12 222.35  159,18 170,23  Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterNewcastle Index (GAR 6.322)6322 Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterIndeks ICI3 (GAR 5.000) Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterIndex HBA (GAR 6.322)71,11  65,57 60,71 70,19 77,94 84,48  93,80 104,94  117,22 180.84  115,42 98,38  75,84  87,79 84,47  86,68 100,33 115,35  130,99 150,03  161,63 215,01  159,79  89,74 86,17  85,50 94,41  93,29 106,02  127,68 149,99 171,44  181,12 222.35  159,18 170,23  Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterNewcastle Index (GAR 6.322)6322 Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterIndeks ICI3 (GAR 5.000) Triwulan I 1st QuarterTriwulan II 2nd QuarterTriwulan III 3rd QuarterTriwulan IV 4th QuarterIndex HBA (GAR 6.322) Kilas Kinerja Performance OverviewLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company ProfileFungsi Penunjang Bisnis Business Support Functions PT Bukit Asam Tbk.

|  Laporan Tahunan 2021248Business Prospects  With the completion of the project to increase the  capacity of coal transportation and ports/piers,  namely Kertapati Pier (seven million tons) and  Tarahan 1 (25 million tons) in 2021, the Company has  increased its operational target in the form of coal  production by 36.4 million tons, transportation 31.5  million tons, and coal sales of 37.1 million tons in 2022.
To support the achievement of production and  transportation targets in 2022, the Company  opened new mines, added production equipment,  operated new Train Loading Stations (TLS-5),  intensive and periodic coordination with mining  contractors to achieve overburden and production  targets, and implement equipment maintenance  self-management and Coal Handling Facilities (CHF)  regularly with preventive principles.
As for the  transportation aspect, the Company continues to  improve coordination with PT Kereta Api (Persero)  to achieve the targets set in the Coal Transport  Contract.
For the sales aspect, the Company is  exploring a new market share in the Asian region to  achieve the Company’s coal sales target.
In addition, in 2022, coal prices are projected to  be relatively good.
Based on the data from Wood  Mackenzie on Newcastle GAR 6,322 and ICI-3  indexes, the price of coal is projected to remain  relatively high.
Through the efforts mentioned above and the price of  coal in 2022, the Company believes that the increase  in operational targets will impact the Company’s  consolidated financial performance.
