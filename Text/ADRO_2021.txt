103103 Laporan T ahunan 2021  >  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk BUSINESS AND  OPERATIONS REVIEW  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk (AEI) delivered on  operational and financial guidance for 2021 with coal  production of 52.70 million tonnes (Mt), a 3% decline year- on-year (y-o-y).
AEI also recorded 5 % y-o-y decline in coal  sales to 51.58 Mt.
Despite being lower, our coal production  achievement is in line with our 2021 production guidance  of 52-54 Mt.
We booked operational EBITDA of US$2.1 billion, 138%  increase y-o-y, exceeding our revised operational EBITDA  guidance of US$1.75 billion to US$1.9 billion.
Strong coal  prices due to higher coal demand on the back of global  economic recovery have boosted our ASP, which increased  by 70% y-o-y.
We had forecasted a stronger market in 2021 from the  recovering economies, however the supply crunch and  buoyant demand provided further tailwind to global coal  prices.
We had planned to increase our strip ratio to 4.8x  in 2021, but due to the bad weather condition, we were  only able to achieve strip ratio of 4.1x, 8% higher y-o-y.
The higher strip ratio, overburden removal volume,  higher fuel price, and longer distance increased our coal  cash cost (excluding royalty) by 16% y-o-y.
Core earnings, our profit excluding non-operational items,  increased 210% y-o-y to US$1.26 billion.
We maintained  robust liquidity position at US$2.3 billion, consisting of  US$1.81 billion in cash, US$221 million in other investments,  and US$296 million in undrawn committed loan facilities.
Our strong liquidity position enabled us to achieve net  cash position in FY2021.

The main coal producing asset within the  Adaro Group is PT Adaro Indonesia (AI), which accounted  for 82% of AEI’s total coal production.
The rest were from  Balangan Coal Companies (Balangan), PT Mustika Indah  Permai (MIP), and PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk (AMI).
AI, Balangan and MIP produce medium calorific value  thermal coal with low pollutant content widely used by  coal-fired power plants.
AMI produces mostly hard coking  coal product used as raw material in the production of  steel.
Coal production from Balangan increased 14% y-o-y  to 5.24 Mt, coal production from MIP increased 53% y-o-y  to 2 Mt, and coal production from AMI increased 23%  y-o-y to 2.3 Mt.
We recorded total coal sales of 51.58 Mt in 2021, a 5% decline  y-o-y.
We comply with the domestic market obligation,  and we also supply our coal to more than 50 customers in  13 countries.
We have a solid customer base – consisting  of mostly blue-chip, sovereign-backed power companies  with long-term volume contracts – which value the low  pollutant content of our Envirocoal and the reliability of  supply that we can provide them with.
Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia market  each accounted for 20% of our sales volume in 2021.
Sales  to China increased to 19%, inline with the higher demand  of Indonesian coal from the country on the back of its  tension with Australia.
The following table shows the sales  breakdown in 2021 based on geography.
Sales Proportion | Proporsi Penjualan Indonesia 28% Northeast Asia | Asia Timur Laut 20% Southeast Asia | Asia Tenggara 20% China | China 19% India | India 11% Others | Lainnya 2% Overburden removal We removed a total of 218.90 million bank cubic meter  (Mbcm) of overburden in 2021, 4% increase y-o-y.
Blended  average strip ratio in 2021 was 4.15x or below our planned  strip ratio of 4.8x as we experienced prolonged rainy  season in 2021, and transition of contractors at PT Adaro  Indonesia.
We are still in the range of our average life of  mine strip ratio and able to maintain our long-term coal  reserves.
Business prospects We witnessed how volatile a coal cycle is in the past two  years.
In 2021, the upcycle driven by economic recovery  has resulted in never-before-seen level of coal prices,  which created a boon for our profitability.
However, we  must not waver in our focus on efficiency and operational  excellence, as coal price is beyond our control.
Further, we  must ensure that we have a balanced business model to  minimize the impact of coal cycle to our earnings.
We believe that the fundamentals for coal market are  solid, supported by developing economies especially in  the Southeast Asia and South Asia region.
The growing  requirement for electricity and steel to support increased  urbanization, infrastructure building, and economic  growth in those regions will become the underlying factor.
The IPO of our subsidiary PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia  Tbk (AMI) is one of the keys for us in development of  our non-coal mining businesses.
AMI saat ini menambang batu bara metalurgi melalui  106106 Annual Report 2021  >  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk The Pit-to-Power Business Bisnis dari Tambang sampai  Pembangkit Listrikbut we envision AMI to be the centre for management  and development of our business endeavors related to  minerals.
One of AMI’s subsidiary is planning to develop an  aluminum smelter in Kalimantan Industrial Park Indonesia  (KIPI), Indonesia’s first green industrial facility.
The Adaro Power and Adaro Water pillars are actively  participating in bids for various projects.
Adaro Power  will focus on renewable power projects, as we seek to  improve our environmental performance.
The upcoming  operations of coal-fired power plants under the  government electrification program, including the Adaro  Group’s own power plant, will provide volume growth  potential for our services and logistics pillars.
We will also  develop other businesses as part of our green initiatives  such as water treatment and forestry for carbon capture.
Coal industry overview and outlook Global economic recovery, geopolitical issues, government  policies, weather disruptions and COVID-19 pandemic  have colored the thermal coal market in 2021.
Strong La  Nina at the beginning of 2021 exhausted gas inventories  in the northern hemisphere in Asia and Europe.
At the  same time, the global economic recovery post COVID-19  pandemic laid the foundation for strong power demand.
Tight supply situation due to adverse weather, logistics  issues, manpower, and heavy equipment shortages  created limited increase in coal export volumes.
Amid  the surging demand, this situation drove coal prices to  record highs.
Following China’s government intervention,  coal prices cooled off in the end of the year – however,  seaborne thermal coal prices still recorded a net gain  over 2020.
We anticipate that the coal market in 2022 will be  supported by economic growth, although COVID-19  continues to cast a shadow over the growth potential.
World Bank expects the world economy to grow by 4.1%  in 2022, and energy will be the key factor to achieve that.
We believe coal will still play a majority role in the energy  mix as the economics are in favor of coal, amid the high  gas prices.
McCloskey predicted that coal demand in 2022  would grow by 2%.
Coal demand would continue to be intact in the long term  backed by the needs of reliable fuel supply, economical  fuel cost, and demand growth from South Asian and  Southeast Asian countries.
New power plants coming  online in the Indian Ocean countries will increase its coal  demand by 2.8% CAGR from 2021 - 2025 according to  McCloskey.
The region’s demand is forecast to grow at  4% CAGR from 2021 – 2025.
Indonesian domestic market is also a key driver in coal  demand growth, with new coal fired power plants online  in the period of 2022 – 2025.
According to PLN’s RUPTL  2021 – 2030, the portion of coal in the fuel mix would  remain around 60% until 2030 with planned new installed  capacity during the period of 14 GW.
Demand fundamentals for metallurgical coal will  also remain intact in the long-term, underpinned by  infrastructure growth and the advent of green economy  which requires vast amount of steel.
Steel production  and consumption is forecasted to grow and demand  for metallurgical coal is expected to reach 397 juta ton  in 2030.
China’s demand is forecasted to remain stable  in the next decade, with continued met coal imports to  satiate its need for steel production and consumption.
AEI’s sales to Indonesia accounted for 28% of total sales  volume in 2021, followed by Northeast Asia and Southeast  Asia at 20% each.
China was 19% of our sales, in-line with  its higher coal demand for Indonesian coal.
Our marketing efforts are supported by differentiated  market positioning due to the ultra-low pollutants  content of our coal and our reputation as a reliable and  dependable supplier.
We continue to maintain customer  satisfaction by making various efforts to ensure quality  and reliability through good coordination along AEI’s  vertically integrated coal supply chain.
Information on investment, expansion,  divestment, and others We now operate eight business pillars comprising of  coal mining and non-coal mining businesses.
Despite  the significance of coal mining to our profitability, the  contribution of non-coal mining continues.
It is our  objective to grow the non-coal mining pillars to provide  us with stable returns and balance the volatility of coal.
This marks the Adaro  Group’s first step in expansion to minerals.
The IPO of AMI is one of the keys for us to develop of our  non-coal mining businesses.
We envision AMI to be the  centre for management and development of our business  endeavors related to minerals.
Adaro Power The construction of PT Bhimasena Power Indonesia (BPI)  2x1,000 MW coal-fired power plants reached 96.9% at the  end of 2021.
We have completed few milestones, including  first synchronization and coal firing.
Adaro Power continues to study renewable power  projects such as hydro, wind power, and solar PV to  diversify its energy mix and to support PLN through  unsolicited proposal and tenders.
Adaro Power is also  developing captive use power generation projects for  our other business units.
Adaro Power completed the  capacity expansion of its Solar PV in Kelanis Dedicated  Coal Terminal and is in pre-feasibility study phase for  development of mini-hydro at AMI.
Adaro Water Adaro Water continues to improve on its performances  to achieve operational excellence for its operating water  treatment plants (WTP) and slurry management facilities.
Construction of PT Dumai Tirta Persada (DTP) has reached  50 lps out of the total capacity of 450 lps.
PT Grenex  Tirta Mandiri, a company acquired in June 2021, started  construction of water treatment plant with a capacity  of 200 lps.
PT Adaro Wamco Prima (AWP) continued its  strong performance and has become AI’s primary partner  for slurry management.
Meanwhile, PT Adaro Tirta Sarana,  has started dewatering operation of some mining areas  in AI since December 2021.
Targets and results in 2021 Although we had expected that the projected post- pandemic economic growth will have a positive impact  on coal demand, we did not foresee the level of coal prices  that happened during the year.
We  revised and increased our Operational EBITDA guidance  to US$1.75 billion to US$1.9 billion to reflect the strong  industry fundamental and coal prices.
We delivered total coal production of 52.70 juta ton in  2021, 3% lower y-o-y.
We recorded revenue of US$3.99  billion in 2021, 58% increased compared to 2020, as our  ASP increased by 70% y-o-y.
Blended strip ratio for the  year was 4.15x, lower than our guidance of 4.8x, due to  unfavorable wet weather at our mine site for the most  part of the year.
Higher overburden removal volume and  higher fuel cost drove the 16% y-o-y increase in coal cash  cost per tonne.
We delivered strong operational EBITDA of US$2.1 billion,  above our revised guidance of US$1.75 billion to US$1.9  billion.
We maintained a strong balance sheet with robust  liquidity position at US$2.33 billion, consisting of US$1.81  billion in cash, US$221 million in other investments, and  US$296 million in undrawn committed loan facilities.
This  level of liquidity provides us with the flexibility to execute  our strategic plans.
We spent US$193 million for capital expenditure in 2021,  lower than our guidance of US$200 million to US$300  million.
The capital expenditure in 2021 was spent on  purchase and replacement of heavy equipment (US$112  million), purchase of docking vessel (US$15 million), port  expansion at AMI (US$6.6 million), and the remaining was  used for maintenance.

This business model allows us to be more efficient while  at the same time creates business opportunities in the  entire business pillars.
Our businesses are divided into  four main business pillars, namely Adaro Mining, Adaro  Services, Adaro Logistics, and Adaro Power.
We also have  four supporting business pillars, namely Adaro Land,  Adaro Water, Adaro Capital, and Adaro Foundation.
Having  these eight business pillars strengthen the foundation  of our business and provide us with a more resilient  and competitive position for the longer term.
In 2022,  approximately 96% of AEI’s revenue is generated from  coal mining and trading.
Our subsidiaries in the four main business pillars are  involved in each part of the coal supply chain, which allows  us to control costs and offer more reliable coal supply to  our customers.
During a period where coal price is under pressure, the  portion of non-coal mining in our EBITDA protects AEI’s  profitability.
In 2021, due to the strong coal price, non-coal  mining contributed approximately 24% of our operational  EBITDA.
Profit for the period, excluding non-operational items net of tax (amortization of mining properties, prior year tax assessment,  loss on derivative financial instruments, loss on impairment of loan to related parties, recoverable of allowance for uncollectible  receivables, loss on impairment of fixed assets, loss on impairment of investments in JV, loss on impairment of mining properties, and  decommissioning cost). 2.

Although we do not have  specific target in term of indebtedness, we continue to  abide by our loan documents.
We actively and regularly  review and manage our capital to ensure optimal  capital structure and return to the shareholders, taking  into consideration the efficiency of capital use based  on operating cash flows and capital expenditure and  consideration of future capital needs.
Total liabilities as of end of 2021 were US$3.13 billion  and total equity was US$4.46 billion, or 41% and 59%  correspondingly of our total capital.
Our interest-bearing  debts at the end of 2021 were US$1.60 billion, 7% higher  than the corresponding period in 2020.
Liquidity remained  robust and we recorded cash balance of US$1.81 billion,  and hence we were able to achieve net cash position in  2021.
Current liabilities increased by 19% y-o-y to US$1.36 billion  while non-current liabilities increased by 38% y-o-y to  US$1.77 billion.
Total liabilities increased mainly due to the followings: 1.
The 1,192% increase in non-current bank loans from  US$43 million in 2020 to US$551 million in 2021 as our  subsidiaries entered into agreements for new facilities  from our relationship banks during the year.
The new  loan facilities will extend our maturity profile and will  further strengthen our capital structure. 2.
The 422% increase in taxes payable from US$66  million in 2020 to US$345 million in 2021 due to higher  corporate income tax payable from higher profitability.
The management is of the opinion that these changes will  not affect AEI’s financial performance in the current year.
Current maturity of long-term borrowings The current portion of long-term borrowings declined by  58% y-o-y to US$267 million as some of our bank loans  matured during the year, most of which relates to PT  Adaro Indonesia’s syndicated bank loan that was fully  repaid in May 2021.
Long-term borrowings, net of current  maturity The non-current portion of long-term borrowings  increased 55% y-o-y to US$1.33 billion.

We maintain a healthy balance  sheet and recorded net cash position in 2021.
Net revenue and average selling price  We booked revenue of US$3.99 billion in 2021, 58% higher  y-o-y, mainly due to the 70% y-o-y increase in ASP.
Our  coal mining and trading division generated 96% of our  revenue.
Cost of revenue  Our cost of revenue increased by 14% y-o-y to US$2.22  billion driven by higher strip ratio and higher mining  cost – following higher fuel prices and higher royalty  payment from stronger ASP.
Our blended strip ratio for  the year was 4.15x, lower than our guidance of 4.8x due  to unfavorable wet weather throughout the most part  of the year.
Total fuel cost increased by 29% y-o-y as fuel  cost per liter increased.
Coal cash cost per tonne (excluding royalty) increased by  16% y-o-y due to higher strip ratio and higher fuel cost.
We continued to maintain efficiency along our vertically  integrated coal supply chain.
Total fuel consumption declined 4% following the  decrease in production volume.
Meanwhile, fuel price  per liter increased by 34% y-o-y.

This achievement was higher than our  revised operational EBITDA guidance for 2021 of US$1.75  billion–US$1.9 billion.
We recorded strong operational  EBITDA margin of 53%, which was 18% increase y-o-y.
We excluded, among others, a total of US$68 million  of loss on impairment in investments in joint ventures  related to our investment in a low CV coal asset in East  Kalimantan.
Those items are one-time, non-operational  expense.
Approximately 24% of our operational EBITDA  was generated by non-coal mining pillars which provides  stability and protection against coal cycles.
Sekitar  24% dari EBITDA operasional dihasilkan oleh pilar non  pertambangan batu bara yang memberikan stabilitas  dan perlindungan terhadap siklus batu bara. 115115 Laporan T ahunan 2021  >  PT Adaro Energy Indonesia Tbk Operational EBITDA is the primary metric we use to  measure our operating performance as we believe it is  useful for analysts and investors to compare and evaluate  our operational performance without regard to capital  structure or other non-operational items.
Core earnings Our underlying core earnings in 2021 was US$1.26 billion,  210% higher y-o-y.
Our core earnings exclude non- operational items net of tax which reflects the quality  performance of our core business and operational  excellence.
Non-operational items In 2021, we recognized US$77 million of expenses related  to non-operational items, the majority of which is from  US$68 million of loss on impairment in investments in  joint ventures.
We separate these items and exclude  them from the calculation of our operational EBITDA  and core earnings to provide a better understanding  and comparative basis of our underlying financial  performance.
These items are non-cash, non-operational  charge which does not affect our cash flow.
We recognized impairment in investments in joint venture  to simplify and improve the strength of our balance sheet.
This is related to our investment in a low CV coal asset in  East Kalimantan.
It is our assessment that the long-term  fundamental for coal remains intact and by recognizing  the impairment, we simplify our balance sheet and  strengthen our financial position.
