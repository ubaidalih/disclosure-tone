Global Economy The world encountered intense uncertainties throughout  2023, with global economic fragmentation on the rise, inflation  stubbornly high, energy and food prices remaining volatile, and  geopolitical tensions exacerbating in eastern Europe and the  Middle East.
Global GDP growth decelerated to 3.1% in 2023, according to the  IMF, mainly weighed down by a sluggish Europe.
India carried on as  the global economic engine, with 6.7% growth, well above the other  large economies worldwide.
The United States, which pressed on  with the decoupling of its economy from that of China’s, saw its  GDP expand by 2.5%.
Technology took center stage in the global economic picture of  2023, with the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) that seemed  set to touch upon and transform nearly all aspects of modern life.
In the US, stocks of the so-called “Magnificent Seven”—Alphabet,  Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, all tech- related—saw their prices soar by multiples of the wider S&P 500  index’s 24% growth, in a year where nearly all other sectors were  flattish.
For the global banking sector, 2023 was a particularly challenging  period.
The collapse and rescue of some high-profile banks in the  US and Switzerland in early 2023 brought some note of caution,  highlighting the need for further guardrails against systemic  banking failures.
Despite this, global banks’ return on equity was estimated to  reach 13%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis.
This robust  gain was propped up by the interest rate hikes that central banks  did over the course of 2023, a measure that eventually brought  inflation rates down from their peaks in the previous year.
Indonesia’s Economy In 2023, Indonesia’s GDP grew by 5.05%, according to a report  by the Indonesia Statistics (BPS), driven by strong household  consumption and consistent inflows of fixed investment in the first  year post-pandemic Nevertheless, owing to weaker coal and CPO prices, and  exacerbated by slowing demand for goods from its top trading  partners China and the US, Indonesia’s trade balance dwindled as  both export and import slumped, by 11.34% and 6.55%, respectively.
The global energy market in 2023 experienced a reversal from  the exuberance of 2022.
While coal export value shrank, abating  pressures on energy commodities also meant that Indonesia spent  less on its oil and gas imports to meet domestic energy needs.
This helped push annual inflation down by more than half, from  5.51% to 2.61% according to Indonesia Statistics.
This was well  within Bank Indonesia’s target range of 2%–4%.
Pressures on food  prices, most notably rice, remained a key contributor to inflation,  notwithstanding a steadier global supply of grains.
With inflation kept in check, throughout 2023, Bank Indonesia took  a less hawkish monetary policy than many other central banks,  which tended to trail the US Federal Reserve’s raising of its Fed  Funds Rate (FFR).
Compared to The Fed’s four hikes of 0.25% each  in 2023, Bank Indonesia only did so twice: first in January and then  in October, bringing the Bank Indonesia 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate  (BI7DRR) to 6.00% by year-end.
Bank Indonesia’s policy succeeded in staunching further  depreciation of the rupiah amidst a powerful USD for much of 2023,  boosted by The Fed’s four rate hikes.
Based on Bank Indonesia  data averaged for the year, the rupiah only shed 2.54% of its value  against the USD.
Banking Industry Review In 2023, in the high interest rate milieu, Indonesian banks  continued the fine performance they had shown one year prior.
The  steady recovery from the pandemic saw physical mobility back to  pre-2020 levels and economic activities improved across all levels.
Third party funds stored in commercial banks in Indonesia reached  IDR8,457 trillion as at the end of 2023, a 3.73% increase from one  year prior, supported by time deposits growth of 4.48%.   76 77 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Highlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability Pertumbuhan kredit lebih baik, yaitu 10,61% hingga mencapai  Rp7.187 triliun.
Growth in lending over the same period was stronger, at 10.61% to  end the year at IDR7,187 trillion.
Investment lending was the major  booster, growing by 12.26%, followed by working capital loans  (10.05%) and consumer loans (9.10%).
The top three economic  sectors dominating lending growth in 2023 were trading, financial  intermediaries, as well as transportation, warehousing, and  communications.
Loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) was recorded at 84.11% industry-wide  at end of 2023, while among KBMI 2 banks, LDR stood at 87.38%,  compared with 81.09% one year prior.
An expansion in lending at higher interest rates allowed  commercial banks to post higher interest income, pushing their  net interest margin (NIM) to 4.92% for 2023, higher than in 2022.
Likewise, their ratios of operating expenses to operating income  (BOPO) also improved slightly to 78.94%.
This pushed return on  assets (ROA) up to 2.78%, from 2.45% in December 2022.
With gross non-performing loans (NPL) maintained around 2.19%,  improving from year-end 2022’s figure, and a capital adequacy ratio  (CAR) of 27.75%, banks entered 2024 well-poised to weather the  prolonged spell of global economic uncertainty as many analysts  have envisaged for the road ahead. 2024 will prove to be a crucial point in terms of how the current  trends in the banking sector play out.
Sharia banking, which had  performed better than the overall industry, posting a 11.81% growth  in assets in 2023, is set to carve up a greater market share, given  the public’s maturing understanding about sharia-based financial  products.
Progress in sharia banking will be aligned with OJK’s  2023–2027 roadmap for this segment.
Meanwhile, with a steep rise in both frequency and value of  tech-based banking transactions, which had truly taken off since  the pandemic, commercial banks previously operating in the  conventional arena have been augmenting their digital presence.
As the number of tech-based banks soared, their respective  strategies have propelled them along different growth trajectories.
Bank Jago has once again demonstrated excellence in developing various  products and services that cater to its customers’ financial needs.
In 2023,  the enrichment of features in its mobile applications, Jago and Jago Syariah,  continued to take place, alongside the cultivation of the digital ecosystem  through an ever-growing partnership network.
As explained below, these business strategies aim to provide more  comprehensive and diverse solutions for customers, especially  among the mass market and mass affluent segments, in transacting  and managing their finances at the heart of their daily life.
Jago App Feature Enrichment In 2023, Bank Jago boosted the value proposition of the main  features in the Jago app, namely Pocket.
This feature makes it  easier for customers to manage their finances more wisely and  carefully.
Through Pocket, customers can create up to 40 sub- accounts, and with these, they can manage and allocate their  funds for various needs.
Several types of pockets are available to serve special purposes  and with a distinct set of offers.
Savings Pocket help customers  save more regularly, offering an interest rate of 3.75% per year  and the flexibility for customers to withdraw money at any time.
Customers can also set their savings targets and take advantage of  the autosave feature to commit to automated saving schedules.
Locked Pocket allows customers to lock their balances with  the reward of higher yields.
This pocket is useful for protecting  customer funds from non-essential expenses and customers can  use it to achieve their planned financial goals.
Shared Pocket is inspired by the concept of “arisan”, a type of  social gathering common in Indonesia.
Through this pocket,  several customers can combine their funds to be managed in one  pocket, accessible to all.
This feature is ideal for managing group or  family finances, as all members of the Shared Pocket can view the  balance and perform transactions from this pocket. 78 79 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Highlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability Pengguna Aplikasi   UsersDana Pihak Ketiga  Third-Party Funds 8,1 12,07RpPada aplikasi Jago Syariah, di tahun 2023 diluncurkan produk  Deposito Jago Syariah dengan akad mudharabah muthlaqah , yang  menawarkan imbal hasil yang menarik, mudah diakses, dan dapat  dipantau kapan saja.
On the Jago Syariah application, in 2023 the Jago Syariah Time  Deposit product was launched under the mudharabah muthlaqah  contract.
The product offers attractive returns, with the funds  ready to access and monitor at all times.
The Jago application also provides other features that provide  convenience for customers in performing transactions and  managing daily finances.
Customers wishing to manage their funds in a more planned  manner can access Bank Jago’s service provided in collaboration  with leading financial technology (fintech) partners on the Jago  app.
With Stockbit and Bibit, customers can invest in the capital  market hassle-free.
Bank Jago customers can use two types of debit cards—GPN and  Visa.
GPN is suitable for non-cash payments throughout Indonesia,  while Visa is the right choice for online payments and overseas  transactions.
Bank Jago debit cards can be used at all ATMs and  EDCs in the ATM Bersama and Alto networks in Indonesia, as well  as Visa network worldwide.
Customers can also create and manage  multiple cards, link a certain card with a specific pocket in the  application, and track expenses in real time.
One of the top features in the Jago App is the Spending Analysis,  which helps customers categorize and track their spending.
Supported by machine learning and artificial intelligence, the  Jago App can automatically classify expenses based on their daily  habits, then present them in attractive and easy-to-digest graphs.
With this analysis, customers are expected to better understand  their financial habits, so they can manage them better.
On the Jago App, customers can also pay routine bills, such as  electricity and internet, with ease.
Bill payments can be scheduled  automatically, according to customer needs.
Jago also provides the  Request Money that one customer can do to another, for example  to ask for payments of shared expenses.
Transaction security is the Bank’s topmost priority.
Jago  and Jago Syariah apps are protected by the most advanced  cybersecurity technology in its class.
Security for both applications  is multilayered, from PIN, biometric scanning, to two-factor  authentication (2FA), while customer data is protected with end-to- end encryption.
Nurturing the Digital Economic Ecosystem Jago’s digital ecosystem development is supported by strong  and sustainable partnerships.
The partnership network continues  to expand by deepening existing and engaging more strategic  partners into this ecosystem.
This partnership has been built  amidst increasingly keen competition among digital financial  industry players, especially tech-based banks, as well as the  prevailing challenges in the economy.
This success was supported  by extensive and solid technical capabilities and the Life-Centricity  principle, which Bank Jago upholds in developing tech-based  financial products and services.
In 2023, Bank Jago continue to deepen the partnerships with six  leading players in the ecosystem: GoTo superapp, e-commerce  company Tokopedia, financial technology platform Kredit Pintar,  multifinance company BFI Finance, and the investment platforms  of securities companies Stockbit and Bibit.
Collaboration with GoTo brought significant results in 2023 with  the launch of the GoPay Tabungan by Jago savings product.
This marked an important milestone in the partnership between  Bank Jago and Gojek.
All Gojek users can now register as GoPay  Tabungan by Jago customers directly on the Gojek and Gopay app.
GoPay Tabungan by Jago offers fast and simple registration,  attractive rates, zero administration fees, and freedom to move  funds.
GoPay Tabungan Syariah by Jago is also available for those  who prefer to transact under sharia principles.
These features,  seamlessly integrated with the GoTo ecosystem, make GoPay  Tabungan by Jago the right choice for those who want flexibility,  convenience, and attractive financial value, all in one platform.
Bank Jago continues to support Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises  (MSMEs) in Indonesia by increasing the ease and efficiency in  managing their finances through digital innovation.
One of the  innovations in 2023 in this area was integration with the GoBiz  application, which facilitates food sellers on the GoFood platform  to manage their operational account.
GoBiz users can withdraw  money from the sale of their goods directly to their accounts at  Bank Jago.
They can open an account directly from the GoBiz  application, making transferring funds more cost- and time- efficient.
In line with the gradual post-pandemic recovery of MSMEs, Bank  Jago’s total lending to this segment reached IDR1.428 trillion as at  the end of 2023.
Bank Jago teamed up with Bibit app for investing in mutual funds  and stocks, and Stockbit app for investing in the capital market.
This is Bank Jago’s market expansion to the mass affluent segment.
For customers in this segment, through collaboration with and  integration of Bibit and Stockbit into Jago App, an innovative  investment solution was born: Bibit Plus.
It enables customers to  invest money in mutual funds and the stock market on a single  platform, utilizing Jago RDN as the source of funds, all seamlessly.
The integration of Bibit with Bank Jago’s Customer Fund Account  (RDN) provides great benefits for customers, namely faster  transactions and instant redemption (for select mutual funds).
Partnership and Ecosystem Lending   Bank Jago realized its aspiration to become a tech-based  bank that drives Indonesia’s digital ecosystem by developing a  partnership lending scheme that has been consistently built upon  collaboration with various ecosystem partners.
Since 2020, Bank  Jago has established partnerships with various entities, including  multifinance companies, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, and  other digital financial institutions.
At the end of 2023, Bank Jago recorded total assets of  IDR21.30 trillion, a substantial increase from IDR16.97 trillion by  the end of 2022.
This asset growth was driven by an increase in  loan disbursement, from IDR9.43 trillion at the end of 2022 to  IDR13.02 trillion by the end of 2023.
The main achievements of the partnership and ecosystem lending  business in 2023 were primarily derived from collaboration with  several multifinance companies.
This business segment posted  growth of more than twice-fold since the previous period.
Despite  this increase in loan volume, Bank Jago continued to maintain the  quality of its assets.
Gross NPL level was 0.8%, much lower than the  industry average and the maximum limit set by the regulator.
One of the keys to Bank Jago’s success in distributing lending  has been a partner selection strategy that is based on several  essential criteria.
These criteria include the compatibility between  Bank Jago’s vision and mission and those of its partners’, as well  as the partners’ rock-solid reputation and financial condition.
Bank Jago prioritizes partners who are actively engaged in the  mass market financing segment and which have a tech-based  operational infrastructure, in line with the core principles of Bank  Jago’s business model as a tech-based bank.
Parity of digital  understanding and competence between Bank Jago and partners  supports the integration of both parties, ensuring more efficient,  quick, and seamless processes.
Throughout 2023, Bank Jago faced a challenge from the  increasingly fierce competition in partnership lending.
As a pioneer  in this field, Bank Jago is witnessing ever more competitors  adopting a similar business model.
In facing this competition, Bank  Jago utilizes its experience as a pioneer and the capabilities it has  built from the start to offer more extensive, quality and valuable  partnerships for potential partners from the ecosystem.
Each partner has unique needs whilst Bank Jago can customize  services according to their conditions.
With this capability, Bank  Jago and its partners can create a solution that can be marketed  together.
Sustainable Finance Challenges and Progress There is a substantial opportunity in providing financing to  businesses to achieve the SDGs, mitigate climate change, and  adapt to sustainable economy in Indonesia, particularly in sectors  such as agriculture, transportation, and energy.
However, Bank  Jago continues to face substantial challenges, largely due to a lack  of shared perception among stakeholders about the concepts and  principles of sustainable finance, and the limited know-how for  implementing sustainable business activities and for managing the  associated risks.
Given these pertinent challenges, it is paramount for the Bank to  understand the aspirations and needs of the market.
They are the  basis for creating added value for customers.
Bank Jago upholds  stringent risk management for its products that will be further  developed.
Bank Jago conducts periodic reviews of financing  distribution by taking into account the quality and suitability of  financing objectives, partner competencies and capabilities, and  risk mitigation.
Bank Jago’s implementation of Sustainable Finance as reflected  in its RAKB shows a commitment to social and environmental  responsibility.
The Bank strives to provide benefits to stakeholders  and the environment in the context of sustainable development.
The same approach is applied to banking services, where  Bank  Jago prioritizes the protection of customer data in deploying  internet banking and mobile banking services. 2023 Business Performance Along with ongoing improvements to the Jago and Jago Syariah  applications, the number of users of the apps have increased  significantly.
At the end of 2023, the number of customers reached  more than 8 million, increasing from around 5.1 million at the end  of 2022.
The amount of third party funds (DPK) increased 45.8%,  with the low-cost funds (CASA, or savings and checking accounts)  dominating (approximately 65.3% of total funding).
Thus, cost  of funds were more efficient as Bank Jago disbursed loans of  IDR13.0 trillion, up 38.1% from 2022 position.
Supported by this business performance, Bank Jago’s profitability  was satisfactory.
Interest income reached IDR1.87 trillion, higher  than 2022 of IDR1.50 trillion.
This contributes to achieving better  financial ratios, reflected in the average return on assets (ROA)  of 0.5%.
In addition, gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was  brought down to 0.8% at end of year, better than 2022 of 1.8%.
Together with Tokopedia, Bank Jago is developing a financial  management feature for merchants to transfer their sales proceeds  to Bank Jago accounts automatically.
By adopting the GoPay  Tabungan by Jago model, Bank Jago can provide the same  convenience in accessing funds for Tokopedia merchants.
For financing distribution, Bank Jago partners with financing  companies targeting MSMEs and the sharia segment.
Going  forward, the Bank’s partners will continue to grow in line with the  Bank’s business development.
Productive collaboration is also being forged with major players  in the mobile telecommunications sector, in the form of providing  loan solutions integrated into the telecommunications company’s  application.
Through this collaboration, Bank Jago can expand its  market share to millions of telecommunications service subscribers  throughout Indonesia, and bring smart and relevant financial  solutions into their lives.
Internally, Bank Jago focuses on strengthening both system and  human resource capabilities as it prepares to become a foreign  exchange bank.
The Bank has also begun to explore offering  credit products for retail customers directly as a manifestation  of its strategy to expand market share and diversify its financing  portfolio.
While in 2023 Bank Jago had not calculated the number  of no-cost retail checking accounts provided to previously  unbanked and underbanked customers, through this financing  scheme Bank Jago will continue to expand and augment the  banking services provided to these customers.
These multi-pronged strategic steps underscore Bank Jago’s  commitment to innovating and adapting to market evolution.
Bank Jago focuses on two main areas for the empowerment of its information  technology, with the aim to support the Bank’s operations and strengthen risk  management.
The first focus area in 2023 was related to boosting the reliability of Information Technology (IT) systems and  infrastructure to enhance customer experience, in line with the significant expansion of the Bank’s customer  base.
Measures that have been taken in this regard included infrastructure developments, both on-premise  and cloud-based, to ensure adequate computing capacity for handling the rapidly rising number of customers  and transactions.
Bank Jago endeavored to enrich the capabilities provided to Jago application users.
To support this effort,  Bank Jago integrated its systems with the systems and applications developed by some of its strategic partners,  and also implemented a range of new features and technologies.
One of the achievements in the area of technology  in 2023 was the implementation of liveness detection mechanism, which has been linked to the system of the  Directorate General of Population and Civil Registration of the Republic of Indonesia.
With this integration in  place, fraud prevention capabilities can be augmented, thereby increasing the security of Bank Jago’s customer  registration process.1Fokus Pertama First Focus Fokus area pertama pada 2023 adalah peningkatan reliabilitas sistem dan infrastruktur Teknologi Informasi (TI)  untuk meningkatkan customer experience , seiring dengan pertumbuhan signifikan dari jumlah nasabah.
Dengan integrasi ini, kemampuan pencegahan fraud dapat ditingkatkan, sehingga proses registrasi nasabah Bank  Jago semakin aman. 84 85 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Highlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability 2 The second focus area was improving cybersecurity.
With the  proliferation of cyber attacks such as ransomware, experienced  by businesses with high frequency nowadays, cybersecurity  has now become a definite requirement for any entity that  wishes to interact intensively in the digital realm, and certainly  for tech-based banks like Jago.
Bank Jago has taken a number of important steps in this area,  including updating its infrastructure, systems and increasing  monitoring coverage of all endpoint devices.
Bank Jago also  set up an integrated system for monitoring applications run on  endpoint devices, to prevent potential security breaches from  these endpoints.
Strengthening cybersecurity was also carried out on the HR  side.
Bank Jago increased employee awareness through training  and simulation sessions to equip them with the skill to deal with  critical situations regarding data security, such as data leaks and  fake emails.
Bank Jago continued to collaborate with vendors and  external partners to further reinforce the security of its systems  and infrastructure.
To ensure smooth operations and customer data security, Bank  Jago focuses on developing and enhancing its technologies, while  also ensuring all aspects of its technological performance and  capabilities meet regulatory standards and industry best practices.
This is imperative because banking regulations continue to  evolve, especially in the fields of cybersecurity and personal data  protection.
With the burgeoning of digital partnerships and ecosystems, Bank  Jago observed the emergence of opportunities to design and  launch new, more effective and efficient products that can boost  customer experience while interacting with the Bank’s services.
One of the areas of focus in this development was the loan  disbursement system.
Bank Jago intends to further develop this  system to support its business strategy in providing services that  satisfy the needs of its business partners and customers.
Bank Jago directs its best efforts to protect customer personal  data.
In preparation for the implementation of the Personal Data  Protection Law (UU PDP) starting October 2024, Bank Jago has  been working with external consultants to ensure the Bank’s  compliance with this new law.
This entails preparations in terms of  human resources, processes, and technology.
One of the preparatory measures at Bank Jago was the holding of  cross-unit simulations with various scenarios related to the PDP  Law, determination of data control domain, and data access.
As one of the tech-based bank pioneers in Indonesia, where the banking  sector continues to undergo digitalization, Bank Jago frequently faces  challenges in meeting its demand for talent with diverse and deep digital  skills.
Facing these challenges, Bank Jago implemented a comprehensive  and adaptive strategy to equip talents with the characteristics that suited the  Bank’s needs and develop their careers with the Bank.
Talent Development Through Jago Digital Academy Bank Jago collaborated with technology company DKatalis to  design and launch Jago Digital Academy.
This marked the Bank’s  effort to overcome the digital competency gap in Indonesia.
Jago  Digital Academy is a collaborative forum that strives to accelerate  participants’ knowledge and develop their digital competencies.
This program offers three main areas related to developing  technical skills: Product Management, Engineering, and Data  Science.
Each field has an important role in tech-based banking  and is delivered with an in-depth understanding of tech-based  bank principles and soft skills that are relevant to today’s digital- based world of work.
Jago Digital Academy prioritizes a collaborative and interactive  learning approach.
Participants have the opportunity to develop  their innovative ideas in a conducive environment that includes  a solid mentoring system and project-based case studies.
This  program also offers participants the opportunity to intern in  Bank Jago’s ecosystem, where they can learn from experienced  practitioners in a dynamic and agile work environment. 88 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023Ikhtisar 2023 Laporan Manajemen Profil Perusahaan Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Tata Kelola Perusahaan Keberlanjutan Peserta Jago Digital Academy Jago Digital Academy Participants Peserta   ParticipantsJago Mitra | Partners Umum | PublicTotal 462 562 1041.128 Pelatihan yang Telah Diselesaikan   Completed Courses 13 81031 Peserta Aktif   Active  Learners 123 167 68358 89 2023 Integrated Annual ReportHighlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability Untuk melipatgandakan manfaat dan memperluas jangkauan Jago  Digital Academy, Bank Jago menjalin kemitraan dengan berbagai  lembaga pendidikan terkemuka, seperti Universitas Indonesia dan  Universitas Bina Nusantara.
To multiply the benefits and expand the reach of Jago Digital  Academy, Bank Jago has established partnerships with various  leading educational institutions, the likes of the University of  Indonesia and Bina Nusantara University.
Students can thus  participate in the Jago Digital Academy program as part of their  independent study, which they can then convert into credit units  to be counted towards their university grade.
Bank Jago is also  exploring collaboration with the Merdeka Campus internship  program and other educational institutions, to support the  implementation of the Academia–Business–Government (ABG)  concept, by which the Bank strives to create synergy between  sectors to support more sustainable economic growth in Indonesia.
Employee Retention and Development In addition to the ever-increasing need for talent, another  main challenge faced by Bank Jago has been maintaining and  developing the competencies of Jagoans—what employees of Bank  Jago call themselves—not only in terms of developing professional  skills, but also internalization of Bank Jago’s core values.
The four core values at Bank Jago—Life-Centricity, Purposeful  Growth, Fearless Creativity, and Empowered Agility—are extracts  from the thoughts and experiences of the founders of Bank Jago.
These values serve as the basis for every Jagoan’s activities.
Of  these four values, Life-Centricity, which views work and finances  from a life perspective, is the primary value.
To ensure the  internalization of these values by employees, Bank Jago launched  the Guidelines for Instilling and Implementing the Purpose &  Values (P4V).
The P4V program not only involved training and  mentoring sessions, but also encourages independent learning and  cross-functional collaboration among the employees.
House of Jagoan, one of Bank Jago’s main engagement programs,  is crucial to strengthening Bank Jago’s core values, while  encouraging employees to actively participate in initiatives that  promote sustainability and community empowerment.
One of  the ways this has been done through House of Jagoan is by  encouraging employee involvement in tackling various challenges  related to sustainability.
The main intent of this measure is to  integrate sustainability practices into employees’ daily activities  and decision making.
In this way, Bank Jago strives to ascertain  that every decision and action of its employees not only focuses on  short-term results, but also considers the long-term impact on the  environment and society.
Most of House of Jagoan’s activities come as a result of the  employees’ own initiatives.
Indeed, this program encourages  employees to design and carry out projects and activities that are  aligned with their own ideas, such as volunteering to empower  communities through education.
Inisiatif ini mencakup pengembangan  platform People Experience (PX) dan peluncuran program  Management and Employee Stock Option Plan  (MESOP).
Remuneration & Welfare To ensure the welfare of its employees, Bank Jago carried out  several initiatives to elevate the work experience while fostering  a sense of ownership and involvement among employees.
This  initiative included the development of the People Experience (PX)  platform and the launch of the Management and Employee Stock  Option Plan (MESOP) program. 90 91 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Highlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability Platform PX Bank Jago merupakan tonggak penting dalam  mendefinisikan kembali cara karyawan berinteraksi dengan aspek- aspek kesehariannya di tempat kerja.
Bank Jago’s PX platform is a milestone in how the Bank redefines  the way employees interact with everyday aspects of their  workplace.
The PX system is designed to help employees take note  of the progress of each task, access ongoing learning, and monitor  their performance appraisals with flexibility and convenience.
The PX platform also integrates various key HR functions, such as  submitting applications for leave and reimbursement, all in one  easy-to-access platform.
In 2023, Bank Jago enhanced the PX platform by integrating  several innovative new features, while focusing on employee  development.
These improvements now provide more effective  tools and resources for employees to manage their career path  and learning, and augment the level of engagement and their  overall work experience.
Addition of the Recognition feature to the  PX platform provided a new dimension in employee engagement  at Bank Jago.
Through this feature, any employee can appreciate  their colleagues by rewarding them with points.
This feature  encourages recognition of colleagues’ efforts and achievements  and also fosters a positive work culture, where appreciation and  support between employees is commonplace.
The reward points  can be collected and exchanged for various prizes, adding an  exciting incentive element to the whole concept, while boosting  employee motivation.
Bank Jago has received approval for the issuance of new shares  within the framework of the abovementioned MESOP, which  is running from June 2023 to 2028.
The MESOP demonstrates  Bank Jago’s appreciation for the hard work of its employees.
With MESOP, employees are given the opportunity to own a  stake in Bank Jago through shares.
This inspires employees to  contribute more by performing better at work, and at the same  time the program also strengthens their relationship with the Bank.
Employee involvement in the Bank’s financial success through  MESOP creates a strong sense of mutual ownership, where  employees feel more connected and committed to the future of  Bank Jago.
Jagoan’s Work Culture The way of working adopted at Bank Jago reflects the principles  of automation and digitalization.
It is also conceptually integrated  with the Bank’s core values.
This is manifested in the vision to  become more “Jago” (“Semakin Jago”), a reflection of the synergy  between Bank Jago’s Purpose Statement and its core values.
With a top-down approach, starting from the highest level of  management down to entry-level employees, Bank Jago has  succeeded in establishing a mindset that is aligned with its core  values.
This approach is bolstered by a series of comprehensive  training and coaching programs, aimed at instilling the desired  work culture and improve employees skills and attitude.
As a lean organization, Bank Jago focuses on creating a holistic  capability journey for its employees.
Bank Jago aspires to identify  and optimize the potential of each employee in terms of technical  competency as well as their value and purpose development.
Bank Jago maintains a unique organizational structure: a relatively  non-hierarchical one that is essential to supporting the very way  of working that the Bank espouses, facilitating inter-divisional  interaction and collaboration. 92 93 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Ikhtisar 2023 Laporan Manajemen Profil Perusahaan Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Tata Kelola Perusahaan Keberlanjutan In this way, Bank Jago is able to attain operational efficiency  and at the same time foster a work environment that promotes  personal and professional growth, while stimulating innovation and  creative thinking.
This collaborative, innovative, and systems-based  work approach, together with a focus on holistic development  of technical competencies, values, and purpose, has propelled  Bank Jago on a path towards realizing its vision: to become  “Semakin Jago”. 2024 Human Resources Plans Bank Jago has designated 2024 as the year of innovation.
The last  two years (2022–2023) have been focused on building the business  and organizational fundamentals.
Now, the momentum that has  been formed and maintained will be directed in 2024 to encourage,  inspire, and motivate employees to innovate further: to be bolder in  their creativity, and more agile in their actions.
Bank Jago is determined that the solutions launched in 2024 will  continue to focus on Life-Centricity, seeking to understand the  pain points of each partner or customer of the Bank, and overcome  them in ways that are practical and creative.
To achieve this goal,  Bank Jago will design a more comprehensive P4V program through  training related to strategic thinking, creative thinking, systems  thinking, ideation, and experimentation.
This in turn is expected  to broaden employees’ insight and equip them to come up with  innovative ideas that are in alignment with Bank Jago’s goals and  values.
Bank Jago also plans to extend its partnerships in academia  and the community.
This supports the Bank’s aim to create a  digital ecosystem that is more conducive to innovation, enabling  the exchange of ideas and collaboration between Bank Jago’s  employees and external parties.
Further enhancements to the PX platform is one of the priorities  for 2024.
Performance management features designed to support  goals management for each employee will be developed.
With  this feature, employees can set, track, and manage their own  performance goals more efficiently, while ensuring these goals’  alignment with Bank Jago’s strategic goals.
Bank Jago also intends  to expand its learning media features, to be integrated into Jago  Digital Academy.
In this way, employees are increasingly facilitated  to access various digital learning sources and develop new  competencies that are relevant to the industry.
Complementing the efforts described above, the “manager  self-service” and “employee self-service” features will be added  to heighten employees’ and managers’ independent access to  information and data related to their work and other employee- related information.
These features allow employees to administer  various aspects of their work more independently and efficiently,  while increasing transparency of the management process.
The above initiatives that have been planned under the human  resources framework are expected to make all Jagoans more  creative, resilient, and agile in navigating the ever-evolving  financial services industry landscape.

The components remained the same as the  previous year.
Total Funding As at the end of 2023, the Bank’s total deposits increased to  IDR12.07 trillion, compared to IDR8.27 trillion at the end of 2022.
This increase was primarily driven by higher amounts of funds  stored in current accounts and time deposits.
The composition of third-party funds held by the Bank at the  end of 2023 was well-balanced, dominated by low-cost funds at  two-thirds of the total, with current accounts making up 34% and  savings accounts 31%.

The Bank reported an increase in net interest and Sharia income,  from IDR1.35 trillion in 2022 to IDR1.57 trillion in 2023.
This increase was aligned with the expansion of lending activities,  resulting in the growth in interest income from loans and income  from Sharia financing, which increased by IDR320.72 billion, or  25.30%, to IDR1.59 trillion in 2023 compared to the previous year. 98 99 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2023 2023 Integrated Annual Report Highlight 2023 Management Report Company Profile Management Discussion and Analysis Corporate Governance Sustainability Peningkatan pendapatan bunga Bank juga diiringi dengan  peningkatan beban bunga dan syariah sebesar Rp162,02 miliar,  atau 109,9%, menjadi Rp309,49 miliar.
The increase in the Bank’s interest income was also accompanied  by an increase in interest and sharia expenses by IDR162.02 billion,  or 109.9%, to reach IDR309.49 billion.
This was mainly due to  interest of current accounts rising sharply by more than three  times, as well as an increase in interest expense for time deposits  and mudharabah profit sharing.
Other Operating Income Other operating income recorded a sharp increase of 152.52% to  IDR197.02 billion, attributable to other provision and commission  income, which amounted to IDR184.19 billion in 2023.
Other Operating Expenses Amidst the expansion of its operations, the Bank adeptly managed  its other operating expenses over the course of 2023.
An uptick of  18.95% brought general and administrative expenses to IDR824.80  billion.
This rise was chiefly linked to the information technology  expenses.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) compares a bank’s capital to its  risk-weighted assets, which include loans, Sharia financing, and  placements with third parties.
A higher CAR indicates that the bank  has sufficient capital to protect customer funds.
For 2023, the Bank registered a CAR of 61.77%, a decrease from  2022’s level.
In 2023, the Bank not only expanded its total assets but also  enhanced the quality of those assets.
This is reflected in the gross  NPL, which was reported at 0.84%, marking an improvement from  the preceding year.
Additionally, this percentage remains below the  commercial banking average NPL of 2.19% at the close of 2023.
As one of the formulas for measuring the Bank’s financial health,  the capital ratio is an indicator used by the Bank to determine the  level of solvency.
The Bank adheres to the principle of prudence  when establishing its capital policy, for instance by diversifying  its capital sources in accordance with its long-term strategic plan.
Thus, the Bank is able to efficiently allocate capital to business  segments that offer the optimal risk-return profile, thereby  meeting the expectations of the stakeholders, including investors  and regulators.
The Bank’s capital adequacy is measured using CAR, which is the  ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (RWA).
As at 31 December  2023, the Bank’s CAR stood at 61.77%, reflecting a decline from  82.75% in 2022.
Nevertheless, this figure still far surpassed the 10%  minimum stipulated by the OJK, adjusted for the Bank’s risk profile.
Debt Paying Ability and Collectibility of Receivables Using a variety of ratios, such as the liquidity ratio, solvency ratio,  and profitability ratio, the Bank evaluates its ability to pay short-  and long-term obligations.
These ratios are parameters that are  constantly monitored to determine the Bank’s liquidity reserve  provisioning capacity.
In terms of solvency, the Bank’s CAR has consistently demonstrated  a strong position, reaching 61.77% by the end of 2023 and  decreasing from 82.75% the year before.
In terms of liquidity, the ratio of liabilities to assets was 60.76%,  higher than 51.29% a year earlier, and the ratio of liabilities to equity  was 154.83%, up from 105.30% a year earlier.

In accordance with OJK Regulation, the Bank’s capital structure is  comprised of Tier 1 Core Capital and Tier 2 Supplemental Capital  (Tier 2).
Core Capital (Tier 1) consists of paid-up capital, other  comprehensive income which comprises changes in fair value  of financial assets available for sale and the surplus from the  revaluation of fixed assets, other capital additional reserves in the  form of share premiums, general reserves, previous year’s loss and  current year’s profit (loss), differences between required provision  and allowance for impairment losses for non-earning assets, and  deductionary components of capital, consisting of intangible  assets, and deferred tax.
Supplemental Capital (Tier 2) consists primarily of required  provisions for earning assets at a maximum of 1.25% of Credit Risk- Weighted Assets.
The goal of the Bank’s capital management is to maintain a strong  capital position in order to support business growth and maintain  the confidence of investors, depositors, customers, and the market.
The Bank considers factors such as optimal return on capital to  shareholders, balance between higher profit and gearing ratio, and  the security provided by a sound capital position.
The Bank is required to meet the requirements of CAR set by  Bank Indonesia/OJK which takes into account the quantitative  considerations such as assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance  sheet accounts, as well as the qualitative considerations about the  components and the weighted risk.
CAR is an indicator used to determine the Bank’s capital and  health.
The CAR of the Bank as of 31 December 2023 was 61.77%.
At the end of 2023, the ratio of the Bank’s Core Capital to Risk- Weighted Assets (RWA) was 60.64%, which was significantly higher  than the 10% minimum set by OJK in POJK No. 11/POJK.03/2016.

Bank Jago focuses on digital channels for its marketing activities, in line with  its characteristic as a tech-based bank that employs digital applications as  the core of its business through conventional and sharia platforms.
This strategy has allowed Bank Jago to penetrate its most  relevant market segments—mass market and mass affluent— more effectively.
Through digital marketing channels, the Bank  can optimize the promotion of its various products and benefits  efficiently.
In 2023, Bank Jago enhanced its focus on strengthening  collaboration with strategic partners.
This initiative contributed  significantly to the Bank’s progress, especially in lending and  growth in the number of customers across various segments,  including retail consumers, mass market, and the middle class  segments.
This collaboration not only has benefited Bank Jago in loan  disbursement, but also has increased brand awareness and  customer understanding of the benefits of using Bank Jago’s  services.
Together with its partners’ networks, Bank Jago has  developed numerous use cases for Jago services, demonstrating  the daily use of the Jago application for customers effectively.
Strategic collaborations with partners have also succeeded in  significantly driving up efficiency in customer acquisition.
Apart  from making marketing costs more optimal, collaboration with  strategic partners also created a higher level of trust, thereby  ensuring the Bank’s business continuity in the future.
In an effort to expand its reach, Bank Jago organized various offline  marketing campaigns to show support for its values.
Marketing  initiatives include sponsoring large-scale events, conducting  regular educational activities by engaging various media,  campuses, and communities within the Indonesian financial and  lifestyle ecosystems, so that the public could become more familiar  with Bank Jago’s presence among them.
In December 2023, Jago Syariah became the main sponsor for the  Halal Fair & Halal Indonesia Trade Show 2023.
This reflected the  Bank’s commitment to supporting halal products, as well as the  inclusion and the development of the sharia economy in Indonesia.
Bank Jago initiated the “Jagoan Kampus” program, an initiative  specifically designed for students to become Bank Jago  ambassadors.
This program supports the career development of  selected students, through a series of training and project-based  internship opportunities at Bank Jago.
Open to final year students  or new graduates from all majors who have an active Jago account,  this program was held online and attended by students from  133 universities, from Indonesia to Korea.
Apart from providing  paid internship opportunities, Jagoan Kampus also conducted  a mentorship program to equip students about the workforce,  thereby delivering distinctive added value to the participants’  future career development.
Bank Jago plans to continue its development with a more focused  and innovative marketing strategy in 2024.
Bank Jago’s core  marketing strategy for 2024 will be strengthening its branding  through the “Bank The Way You Want” campaign, which is replete  with messages that are consistent, attractive, and beneficial to the  public.
This branding campaign will position Bank Jago as a reliable  financial solution that is accessible to all levels of society, with an  emphasis on the ease and flexibility in financial management.
Personalization is key to building customer trust.
With this  background, Bank Jago is stepping up its marketing initiatives  to build stronger relationships with customers through direct  interaction.
The Bank also emphasizes personalized communication  when interacting with customers.
Communication materials for  customers are tailored to the individuals’ needs and preferences,  therefore they feel appreciated and understood.
Moreover,  customers will be introduced to new products from Bank Jago,  which are designed to fulfill various needs from customers.
Support to MSMEs  Bank Jago’s sustainability initiatives are demonstrated by  developing a socially sound portfolio and support for the MSME  sector.
The Bank provided credit to the public sector amounting to  IDR366.8 billion, which made up 2.81% of the Bank’s total financing  in 2023.
This resilience is attributed to the  sector’s robust capitalization, sufficient liquidity, and a well- maintained risk profile.
With respect to December 2023 results, the  banking industry demonstrated excellent performance metrics,  including an RoA of 2.74% and a NIM of 4.81%.
Additionally, the  banking capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood impressively at 27.65%,  serving as a substantial buffer against the backdrop of global  economic uncertainties.
Looking ahead into 2024, the Indonesian banking industry is poised  to capitalize on significant opportunities, driven by the robust  growth in banking lending.
This upward trajectory is expected  to sustain positive financial performance across the sector.
The  strength of the domestic economy stands as a pivotal factor in  propelling national loans growth.
Nevertheless, the banking sector  must navigate the challenges posed by the prevailing uncertainties  in the global economic landscape.
In 2024, Bank Jago is looking to accelerate its growth by enhancing  its digital ecosystem through strategic partnerships and innovative  product development.
The collaboration with Tokopedia is a key  initiative, aimed at simplifying financial management for merchants  by enabling automatic transfers of sales proceeds to their Bank  Jago accounts.
Additionally, Bank Jago is expanding its financing  distribution network by partnering with companies focused  on serving MSMEs and the sharia market segment, ensuring a  broadened and more inclusive financial service offering.
Bank Jago’s strategy also includes forging productive  collaborations with major players in the mobile telecommunications  sector to offer integrated loan solutions.
This partnership is  expected to extend Bank Jago’s market reach across Indonesia,  tapping into millions of potential customers and delivering tailored  financial solutions.
To further enrich its service portfolio, Bank Jago  will introduce services as a foreign exchange bank, offer wealth  management for simplified investment, and provide direct lending.
The Bank also plans to reinforce its governance in risk  management, governance frameworks, internal audits, and IT  infrastructure.
With these initiatives, Bank Jago is targeting to  expand its lending base by 27% in 2024.
