The Home & Personal Care segment represents Home  Care, Beauty & Well-being, and Personal Care business  units.
The segment witnessed growth in 2022 as market  conditions improved due to better control on the  COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the increase in inflation  rates due to commodity prices, including fuel, has  impacted people’s purchasing power.
The Company  also faced other challenges, from supply issues to  intense competition.
Despite challenges and a slight decline in gross profit to  Rp13.09 trillion, in 2022 Home & Personal Care managed  to record net sales of Rp27.26 trillion, increased 3.3%  from the previous year’s Rp26.38 trillion.
Home Care Home Care is a large and continuously growing business  segment supported by Indonesia’s demographic,  macroeconomic conditions, and an opportunity to  increase category penetration.
In 2022, Home Care  experienced decent growth with better control of the  COVID-19 pandemic.
The increase in people’s visits to  traditional markets has positively impacted Home Care,  as traditional markets are one of the keys to the growth  of this segment.
Home & Personal Care 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Unilever’s organisational transformation has enabled  the Home Care business unit to be more agile, with  fewer decision-making layers.
We see that the Compass  organisation has positively impacted Home Care  business unit employees with a change in mindset  and faster decision-making.
We hope this will create  innovations that can support the growth of the Home  Care segment in the future.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance With the pandemic gradually becoming more  controlled, traditional markets were slowly reopening.
This led to an increase in the number of visits by the  public to both traditional and modern markets, which  was conducive to the Home Care business in 2022.
However, inflation increased in the second semester  of 2022, primarily due to the government’s fuel price  increase.
The rising fuel price affected consumers’  purchasing power, especially of those in the lower- middle segment.
In this situation, consumers were  forced to look for similar products at a lower price,  albeit less efficacious, in the Home Care segment and  even reduce their consumption level.
Our products deliver superior cleaning and offer a  better consumer experience in the market.
To ensure  that our consumers can still afford our products, we  have created fair prices based on their purchasing  power on our packaging (from Rp500 to Rp15,000) to  reach different consumer segments.
The move aligns  with the trend of consumers looking for more affordable  products, which often translates to smaller packaging.
We have developed various innovations to drive  performance.
We launched the first-ever Home Care  product range with a Korean Strawberry variant to  respond to K-pop trends, including Sunlight, Rinso, and  Superpell, which were very well received by the public.
Within the first three months since the launch, we were  able to double our sales. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
In line with Unilever’s commitment to delivering  superior products that are good for the planet, we have  developed the first petrochemical-free formulation.
This  formulation is the best in the market for cleaning and  removing dirt and is totally petrochemical free, making  it better for the environment.
With high public awareness of cleanliness, we continued  to strengthen our brands with various advantages.
For  example, Rinso to fight stubborn stains, bacteria, and  viruses; Sunlight Extra Hygienic with superior cleanliness;  and Wipol, which is 100 times more effective against  bacteria and viruses.
With the increasing awareness among industry players  to conduct business according to the Environmental,  Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, Unilever  Indonesia continues to strengthen our efforts at this  front through various progresses.
In the Home Care  segment, 95% of our products are biodegradable,  and we are also pioneers in 100% recyclable sachet  packaging, equivalent to eliminating 1,700 tons of  plastic waste.
Marketing Activities Unilever believes that product excellence and quality  are the central guarantees to attract consumers.
We  are committed to continuously strengthening our core  brands and creating various product innovations to  meet the daily needs of consumers.
In 2022, the reduction of fuel subsidies significantly  impacted the public.
With the increasing inflation rate,  consumers had to reduce their spending on specific  baskets and seek more affordable products in the market.
Having seen this development, we worked to design  suitable marketing activities to communicate that we  had products with the right price and quality to meet  their needs.
Communication was carried out through  various channels, both traditional and digital. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
We continued to increase our presence in traditional  markets, which were still the primary key to growth  and promote our products on e-commerce platforms,  especially for more premium products.
Unilever  Indonesia sees that the number of upper middle class  consumers will continue to increase and is estimated to  reach more than 55% of Indonesia’s total demographics  by 2025.
Personal Care Personal Care is a segment with a strong market position  in Indonesia.
We strive to stay as pioneers and leaders in  the market by offering superior and innovative products  that benefit society, both in function and mission, while  remaining relevant to the current generation.
The shift to Compass organisation, which focuses on  business units, has helped us become more agile and  accountable in strategy implementation, enabling us to  optimise our product performance across including skin  cleansing, oral care, and deodorant categories. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance Overall, 2022 was a turnaround year for Personal Care.
We have bounced back from negative growth in 2021  (USG of -10.6%) to positive growth in 2022 (USG of  9.4%).
Despite facing the challenges of rising inflation,  especially after the fuel subsidy reduction, our business  remained healthily profitable.
In the two-speed economy, where growth is seen in  two different segments, the affordable and premium  markets, we are aggressively driving our business by  leveraging our entire portfolio.
We are boosting sales  across all channels, including traditional and mini  markets, which play an important role due to their  proximity to consumers.
Sales growth in e-commerce  as the channel of the future continued to show rapid  development, where Personal Care sales grew by  double digits (+28% vs 2021) with growing consumer  trends to try various product variants.
To address the issue of purchasing power that has not  fully recovered, Personal Care continued to launch more  affordable products in the market, such as Lifebuoy  goceng, increase promotions in the modern market, and  drive e-commerce performance through designed for  e-commerce value products, such as bundle packages.
We pay attention to the growing role of generation  Z consumers.
We continue to innovate to meet their  needs through our brands, such as Close Up and Axe,  and drive relevant communication through digital  platforms, considering Generation Z’s high level of  engagement with gadgets.
We design products that  have purposes that align with their principles, such as  sustainability and inclusivity.
We also realise the rising number of Indonesian Muslims  who wear hijabs, so we launched various products  that meet their needs, such as Lux Hijab Bodywash,  Pepsodent Siwak Habbatussauda, and Rexona Hijab  Natural Peach & Cool Mint.  04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Bukan hanya pasar modern dan e-commerce  yang  terus bertumbuh, namun juga mini market dan pasar  tradisional yang merupakan kekuatan utama kami sejak Marketing Activities In bringing Personal Care’s performance to positive  growth in 2022, we worked hard to implement a three- pillar strategy to boost sales: Accelerate marketing  efforts and explore the potential of core products,  maximise our entire portfolio, and maximise all  channels.
In our efforts to accelerate marketing and explore the  potential of core products as the first pillar, we focus on  continuously improving our product quality, launching  innovations that meet consumer needs, and increasing  investment in our brands to communicate our product  advantages more effectively and accurately.
As an  example, we have conducted many digital platform  activations that provide tremendous opportunities to  expand our market.
One such example is the health  services for consumers provided by Pepsodent and  Lifebuoy.
For instance, Pepsodent collaborated with  the Indonesian Dental Association (PDGI) to provide  free online dental check-ups to over 30,000 people  nationwide.
Meanwhile, Lifebuoy also launched digital  doctor consultations in collaboration with Halodoc,  which provided free doctor consultation services  through the Halodoc platform.
In the second pillar, which was to maximise the overall  Personal Care product portfolio, we drove products that  still had the potential for improvement in each segment,  such as Dove deodorant, which has its uniqueness  among its consumers.
Some brands, such as Rexona,  were refined with a superior proposition with 72-hour  freshness.
In skin cleansing, we strengthened our focus  on the liquid format by launching Lifebuoy 3-in-1, a  combination of hand wash, body wash, and shampoo  that fights 99.9% of germs with a gentle formula on the  skin and leaves hair soft and silky.
For oral care, which  is already strong in the middle segment, we pushed  the premium segment through Pepsodent Herbal,  Pepsodent Sensitive Mineral Expert & Close Up.
In the third pillar regarding channels, 2022 is where we  focus on developing all channels.
It is not only modern  markets and e-commerce that continue to grow, but  also mini markets and traditional markets that have  been our main strength since the beginning, especially  04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Therefore, in 2022, we again  increased our resource allocation to mini markets  and traditional markets, which resulted in significant  growth.
All of these efforts were able to turn around the  performance of Personal Care in 2022, which we will  continue to improve in 2023 and beyond.
Going forward,  we hope that Personal Care will not only continue to  maintain its strong position in the market, but also  leverage our capabilities to grow the market through  collaboration with partners and consumers, targeted  cutting-edge innovations, and initiatives that bring a  positive impact to Indonesia.
Beauty & Wellbeing Beauty & Wellbeing is a highly specialised segment  with a target market that requires dedicated focus.
As a country with the fourth largest population in the  world, Indonesia is a potential market for the beauty  segment.
We see Indonesian consumers have an  immense willingness to buy, indicating the lucrative  opportunities for greater beauty product penetrations.
The Compass Organization’s design enables Beauty  & Wellbeing division to be faster and serve consumers  better.
We have ample room to be able to launch  innovative products that meet the beauty needs of  consumers.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance 2022 was a year of recovery, following the peak  pandemic period of the last couple of years.
Gradually,  purchasing power is returning, marked by opportunities  in the more premium and affordable markets.
We see that there is consumer interest in trying various  beauty products available in the market.
We see this  interest occurring in almost all product categories.
With the increasing number of dedicated beauty  product channels, the search for hair and skin care  products is also the highest online.
The same trend  is seen in traditional beauty stores, with consumers  increasingly searching for new product information in  the stores.
Our core brands, such as Citra, Glow & Lovely, Vaseline,  Lifebuoy, and Clear, recorded a positive performance.
We will continue to strengthen and develop our core  brands’ potential.
Throughout 2022, we explored many new formats and  variants, such as the launch of Glow & Lovely sunscreen.
We also launched beauty products that captured  market trends, such as K-pop, demonstrating our agility  in adapting to consumer preferences.
To face the intense competition in the beauty market,  we navigated the beauty sector through ongoing  innovation and initiative to attract consumer interest  in Unilever’s brands and products, as well as maintain  price competitiveness in the market, given the increase  in inflation rate in the second half of 2022 that eroded  purchasing power.
We strive to constantly improve  our capabilities through brand strengthening, good  product quality, and marketing. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.

and scalp, while Pond’s Age Miracle has 10 times anti  aging formula to help make skins brighter.
Our core brand continues to reinforce its noble purpose  of consistently contributing to society.
Glow & Lovely, for  example, has consistently provided access to education  for Indonesian women for six years, and Lifebuoy  shampoo donated hair to help cancer patients through  its kindness-sharing program.
We believe the initiatives and strategies implemented in  2022 may serve as a foundation for performance in the  following years.
We have done so much to develop the  Beauty & Wellbeing segment, and we are confident that  we have the capabilities to achieve even better results.
Marketing Activities With the uniqueness of the Beauty & Wellbeing segment,  we need to have a mindset and way of thinking that  reflects our consumers.
Such a mindset will enable us to  launch products to meet their needs.
We do this by, among others, collaborating with  consumers to grow with them.
Through influencers  on various social media, we launched advertisements  and campaigns to market our beauty products.
One  product that has become a trend in the market is  Vaseline Gluta-Hya.
We have strong online and offline partnerships with our  key customers.
During the year we ran many initiatives  for the shoppers in each of these channels,  including  customised activation, innovations and pack sizes. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.

The Foods & Refreshment segment represents Nutrition  and Ice Cream business units.
This segment continued  its growth in 2022 in line with the increase in people’s  purchasing power, although it remained uneven.
The increase in inflation caused by the reduction in  fuel subsidies had impacted on Foods & Refreshment  business, especially ice cream which is still considered  tertiary category.
In 2022, Foods & Refreshment reported net sales  of Rp13.96 trillion, up by 6% from the previous year  at Rp13.17 trillion.
The segment’s gross profit also  increased to Rp5.98 trillion, from Rp5.76 trillion in 2021.
Nutrition Organizational transformation with Unilever Compass  that was also applied in Indonesia, had separated  Foods & Refreshment segment to become Nutrition  (which consists of foods and beverages) and Ice Cream.
The change in the name indicates that the Nutrition  business unit does not only focus on foods and  beverages products, but also the nutritional aspects  within.
This is a form of our commitment to be the  force for good for Indonesian consumers by providing  products that support a healthier diet for a better future  of the nation.
Foods & Refreshment 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
With the new Compass organization, the Company’s  Nutrition business unit is able to respond faster to  Indonesian consumer demands because the leadership  team in the country is authorized to take necessary  business decisions based on deep local understanding.
Moreover, the Compass organisation also enables  closer engagements within the Nutrition team across  Southeast Asia region and also global, ensuring  transfer of knowledge runs smoother and better.
In general, Nutrition products are divided into four  categories: soup stock with core brand Royco, soya  sauce with core brand Bango, tea with core brand  SariWangi, and fruit juice with core brand Buavita.
All  four categories posted encouraging growth results in  2022, higher than 2021.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance A more controlled pandemic conditions in 2022 had  a positive impact on Nutrition’s performance.
People  have started to participate in activities outside of their  homes, large gatherings to celebrate festivities such as  Eid, and face-to-face events.
However, Nutrition also faced various challenges  throughout the year, among others are the rising  number of COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant  which trigerred the reimplementation of mobility  restriction, and the increase in high inflation in the  second half of the year that restrict consumers buying  power.
We  ensure our brands and products stay relevant  for consumers during that tough time, offering right  products and marketing mixes in line with the category  strategy - accessible and affordable. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Our strategy to drive business growth have always  been fundamentally purpose-led and future-fit.
This is  reflected in our various product innovations, campaigns,  as well as community development programs that we  deliver throughout the year.
As a business unit, Nutrition sets ambition to be a world- class force for good in food & beverage in Indonesia.
The  two key objectives: to help people transition towards  healthier diets and to help reduce the environmental  impact of the food chain.
These objectives are delivered through product  innovations that support consumers to live a healthier  lifestyle, such as: Royco improved formulation with  iodised salt to help overcome stunting issues in  Indonesia, Bango Light with less sugar, Sariwangi tea  rich in flavonoid to help maintaining healthy cholesterol  level, and Buavita can fulfills 100% daily requirement of  Vit C to help maintaining immunity.
The innovations are accompanied with market  educational programs for consumers to understand our  products’ superiorities.
For example, Sariwangi collaborates with the  Indonesian Heart Foundation to give community  education programs to regulate their cholesterol level  and live healthier lifestyle including drinking real tea.
Bango Soy Sauce gives authenticity of real Indonesian  taste because only Bango is made from only 4 natural  ingredients that never changed: without colorant,  without artificial sweeteners, and without flavour  enhancer.
The product superiority of Bango soy sauce  has made it no.1 brand in Indonesia. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Royco’s purpose is to reinvent foods for humanity.
It  champions a better way to cook nutritious and delicious  meal, inspire to eat diversely from future foods that are  not only nutritious for the body, but also for earth.
One form of this commitment is through the continuation  of Nutrimenu program in 2022.
Nutrimenu is a program  that drives habitual change to fight imbalance nutrition  in Indonesia by changing “what’s in your plate” with  balanced portion of protein, carbohidate, vegetable  and fruit.
Supporting Ministry of Health program and  collaborate with BKKBN, Royco Nutrimenu Program  in 2022 has reached 16 million households to start  implementing healthier lifestyle through the variety of  everyday meals that are not only delicious, but also  healthy and affordable.
These innovations, efforts, and portfolio completeness  became the performance driver for Nutrition business  growth while we continue delivering our ambition to be  the world class foods for good in foods & beverages in  Indonesia. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Marketing Activities The penetration rate of almost all Nutrition products  had reached above 95%, which made the market  development agenda an important strategy for success  in 2022.
Royco, for example, launched an innovation and  campaign that successfully grown the beef flavour soup  stock market through Royco Beef with new and superior  formula.
This launch was supported by campaigns to  promote Royco Beef as the best product for consumers  who wants to enjoy home-made meatballs (bakso) at  home.
Through various efforts, we successfully grew the  total market as well as winning market competitiveness.
Supporting the government’s efforts to eradicate  malnutriton, including lowering stunting rates, Royco  officially collaborated with the National Population  and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) and partnered with  Ministry of Health through the Healthy Kitchen Tackling  Stunting or Dapur Sehat Atasi Stunting (DASHAT)  program for Royco Nutrimenu program.
The program  carried out community trainings at the village or sub- district level, where women in the community are  educated on how to provide not only delicious foods but  also complete and balanced nutrients for their children.
The year 2022 was also the year where Festival  Jajanan Bango (FJB) is back again as an offline event.
In line with Bango’s purpose to preserve Indonesia’s  culinary landscape, FJB became a platform that brings  consumer together to enjoy their favorite foods while at  the same time empowering micro, small, and medium  enterprises (MSMEs) from all parts of Indonesia.
Riding  on this momentum, FJB took place twice throughout  2022: in March as a partner for the Ministry of Tourism  and Creative Economy during the international Moto  GP Mandalika 2022 event and in October at the Gelora  Bung Karno, Senayan, commemorating the Youth  Pledge Day (Hari Sumpah Pemuda). 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
In communicating our campaigns and innovations,  television still provided a broad reach.
However, we also  saw the continuous growth of digital screens and thus  increased investment in that area.
We made sure that  all of our brands were present in multiple digital and/ or online platforms in order to remain close with our  consumers.
Through these strategies and programs, Nutrition  closed the year 2022 on a positive note, ready to keep  growing and contributing to the company’s success for  the coming year, as well as continue bringing positive  impact on people’s health and the environment.
Ice Cream In line with the restructuring of the Compass  organisation, the Ice Cream segment became a  separate business unit.
This change allowed the team  to be more focused on driving growth potential and  accelerating decision-making by having direct access  to regional and global teams.
It enabled us to become  more responsive in anticipating changes occurring in  the market. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Kali ini kami meluncurkan Paddle Pop Upin & Ipin yang  disukai oleh anak-anak, dengan penjualan yang baik Ice Cream faced quite a  challenge in 2022 due to the  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with the latest Omicron  variant, the spread of flu among children, and the rising  inflation rate due to the reduction of fuel subsidies.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance In 2022, Wall’s Indonesia celebrated its 30th anniversary.
On this special occasion, we strived to maintain our  leadership in the modern market amid the challenges  faced by the Ice Cream segment.
Its position as a tertiary  need resulted in a decline in ice cream consumption as  consumers had to prioritise other needs in line with the  decline in purchasing power due to higher fuel prices.
Moreover, people’s reluctance to eat ice cream during  the flu added a severe challenge to our sales.
Indonesia is a potential market for Ice Cream,  considering that its ice cream consumption per capita  is still one of the lowest in the world, coupled with  low market penetration.
Thus, there is still much room  for growth.
We strive to maintain our competitiveness  through various innovations to move the market.
One innovation launched in October 2022 was Feast  Pop, Wall’s first non-stick Feast ice cream in Indonesia,  which can be enjoyed in a single bite.
The launch of  Feast Pop coincided with World Mental Health Day,  celebrated every October 10, as Wall’s believes that  sharing with others is a way to be happier and good  for mental health.
This innovation received an excellent  response in the market.
We also strengthened our strategy to provide ice cream  for everyone through different price variants.
At the  base of the pyramid, there is Paddle Pop, which has  been accompanying Indonesian children for over 28  years.
This time we launched Paddle Pop Upin & Ipin,  which children loved, with strong sales in general trade  04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
We created excitement in the “value for money”  market by relaunching our legendary Feast brand  and launching Cornetto Coffee Caramel.
On the other  hand, we also encouraged premiumisation through  innovations such as Feast Pop, Cornetto Love Rose (a  rose-shaped ice cream with strawberry cheesecake  flavour), and Magnum Cookies & Cream.
We continued to strive to improve competitive  promotions in the modern market to maintain our  leadership.
To ensure that ice cream stock remained  available, we have digitised the ordering system for our  partners.
Marketing Activities We believe that Wall’s is synonymous with happiness,  in line with our goal to make #EveryoneHappy.
Through  ice cream, we want to educate the public, especially  children, that happiness is not just about money but  also about gathering and sharing stories.
We launched The Happiness Project in 2022 to teach  100,000 children aged 8 – 14 about the true meaning  of happiness through the five foundations of Happiness  (5B): Berteman, Bergerak, Bersyukur, Berkreasi, dan  Berbuat Baik (Making Friends, Moving, Being Grateful,  Creating, and Doing Good).
Not only that, but Wall’s also gave away hundreds of  thousands of free ice creams to healthcare workers,  orphans, and online motorcycle taxi drivers.
Wall’s also  contributed to entertaining people affected by disasters  such as the earthquakes in Lombok and Cianjur, the  tsunami in Palu, and the eruption of Mount Semeru.
We also educated through #PaddlePopMainYuk by  inviting parents to create fun play moments with their  children as they will have a positive long-term impact  on children’s growth and development. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Our ice creams are made with high nutrition standards,  quality sources, and good ingredients for children.
Our  nutrition standards follow the references from the World  Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health.
We have also obtained distribution permits from the  Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM) and  halal certification from the Indonesian Ulama Council  (MUI).
To market our ice cream, we utilised digital channels,  such as Instagram and TikTok, which could make our  products viral, in addition to other channels that drove  sales in traditional and modern markets. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.

Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) recorded a sales growth  of 27.8% in 2022 as outdoor activities and tourism  began to recover.
The number of restaurant visitors  slowly increased, the number of food delivery orders  continued to thrive, and tourism increased compared to  the last couple of years.
This placed UFS at 103% of the  index compared to 2019, or the pre-pandemic period.
For the food service providers, UFS Indonesia is  considered as a company that focuses on the F&B  business.
As one of the world’s leading food service  companies, we provide professional ingredients and  services to meet the needs of hawker centres to five-star  hotels, saving time without sacrificing taste.
UFS has  more than ten chefs in Indonesia to ensure we provide  the right solutions (kitchen tips and menu inspiration)  for Indonesian culinary entrepreneurs.
Some of our  products used in 74 countries worldwide are Knorr,  Hellmanns, and Lipton.
Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Purpose-Led Future-Fit Innovation and  Performance UFS Indonesia sees 2022 as a year of recovery.
We  managed to deliver strong growth thanks to our top 10  products, which contributed 80% to the growth.
Prudent  overhead cost management and effective brand and  marketing investments helped improve profitability.
Globally, UFS Indonesia was recognised as the best  performing UFS business unit, as we were able to  record strong growth in the Top 10 Products and solid  profitability simultaneously.
Our biggest challenge in 2022 came from the supply  chain disruption due to the demand surge and the war  between Russia and Ukraine, which caused business  costs to rise.
Rising fuel prices also impacted logistics,  but we implemented several product-logic saving  initiatives and pricing strategies to protect and sustain  the business.
We kept our campaign focused on Indonesian cuisine,  whether grilled, soupy, or stir-fried.
Our top three  products – Bango, Knorr Chicken Powder, and Royco –  remained the key drivers of business performance in  2022.
Knorr was relaunched as the Knorr Professional  Brand through the Knorr Eksplorasa (Taste Exploration)  campaign in the first quarter of 2022.
This was part  of our attempt to ensure that our products were far  superior to competitors in the market.
As a purpose-driven and reliable business partner,  UFS ensures our product availability 24/7 (online and  offline), provides kitchen tips (through online and social  media content) to improve kitchen efficiency, maintains  cleanliness, health, and safety (CHS) standards in the  dining areas, and inspires them with menu and recipe  inspirations to cope with changing food preferences.
This aligns with UFS’s purpose, “to free you to love what  you do,” which is translated into our mission statement:  Support, Inspire, Progress. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
We are highly concerned about the impact of food on  the planet.
Therefore, we use recyclable packaging  and ingredients, resulting in less waste and energy  consumption to operate the business responsibly.
In  2022, 91% of our packaging was recyclable.
We achieved  this through our efforts to improve the packaging of  Bango, Knorr and Royco which started in 2019.
Marketing Activities UFS used data and analytics to increase the number of  digitally-engaged businesses and sales conversions.
By the end of 2022, we had generated digitally-driven  leads from various F&B businesses nationwide and  had a digital engagement with culinary entrepreneurs  every month through our marketing automation tools.
We strengthened our presence in e-commerce through  various dedicated activities with key players in the  marketplace, resulting in double-digit growth in our  e-commerce channels.
A strong presence on social media platforms, search  engines, and sales conversions on e-commerce channels  were among the key drivers of our success in 2022.
We combined them with effective demand-creation  activities through our dry product samples, offline  and online cooking demos, and effective promotions  to encourage trials and loyalty.
Our communication  content followed three principles: relevance, real-time  and cost-effectiveness, aimed at driving stronger  engagement and higher conversion rates.
UFS’s digital strategy is a multichannel strategy  that combines the best online and offline consumer  experiences.
We inspire and support businesses and  our partners to participate in digital transformation  through various digitisation activities that can make  their businesses digitally present and easier to find by  online visitors or consumers. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Although digital channels such as e-mail and social  media allow us to reach a broader range of consumers,  our primary operations are still based on face-to-face  interactions, where we can introduce products more  interactively (demos and menu ideas), creating higher  opportunities to secure contracts with business players.
We conducted two major marketing campaigns in 2022.
Bango’s Festive Campaign (the Flavour of Ramadhan)  through digital channels, combined with trade and  operator activation programs, resulted in a reach of  more than 12 million, with 55.000 video views, and  double-digit iTO growth compared to the previous  year’s campaign.
Meanwhile, the Knorr Eksplorasa  campaign to support the launch of Knorr Professional  resulted in a reach of over three million and 55.000  e-mail impressions. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.

Dengan adanya komunikasi dua In driving sales throughout 2022, we focused on  strengthening our business fundamentals, this  includes enhancing our competitiveness.
The strategy  successfully drove sales growth across various channels  such as Modern Trade (MT), General Trade (GT),  Distributive Trade (DT), and D-Commerce.
One of our efforts to strengthen our business  fundamentals was through restructuring distributor  channel and strengthening collaboration with our  business partners.
In GT, we strengthened collaboration with distributors  by restructuring to a more appropriate scale that  meets current market demands.
We also managed our  stock inventory to make our business more agile going  forward.
Customer Development also continued engaging with  141 distributors throughout Indonesia to understand  their challenges.
Through this two-way communication,  a community is created where we can collaborate Customer Development 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
to develop our business together.
We want external  perspectives to be represented in our business decisions  so that what we do is relevant to consumer needs.
One of Customer Development’s main objectives is to  ensure our business partners’ profitability and growth.
By doing so, our business will also grow.
As a channel, MT is essential for us; therefore, we continue  strengthening our relationships and collaborations to  ensure all business plans can achieve maximum results.
In 2022, we saw a market recovery with increased visitors  to both traditional and modern markets.
Unilever  Indonesia’s efforts to transform Distributive Trade since  the second half of 2021 started to yield positive results in  2022.
Our business grew by double digits in traditional  and modern markets, especially mini markets.
Facing a temporary inflation rate increase while  purchasing power has not fully recovered, we managed  to have strategic pricing by looking at each portfolio  according to our target market and brand strength.
The  competition in the FMCG industry was intense in 2022,  but we managed to strengthen our leadership in key  channels, namely traditional and modern markets, as  well as e-commerce.
We continued promoting digitalisation, such as through  the Sahabat Warung application, recognising the role  of warungs as a crucial part of Unilever’s business  ecosystem, which has grown and developed since our  inception.
We also encouraged online transactions in  e-commerce by ensuring the right product portfolio for  e-commerce customers, such as the Vaseline GlutaHya  innovation. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
Customer Development also strived to carry out the  company’s mission for greater inclusivity through an  initiative called “distributor sales representative,” which  replaces the term “salesman distributor.
” We believe  that this new designation is more gender-balanced,  demonstrating our efforts to improve equality across all  levels of the Unilever Indonesia ecosystem. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
The two biggest challenges related to the supply  chain in 2022 were the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,  marked by the emergence of the Omicron variant at  the beginning of the year, and the increase in global  commodity prices, which ultimately triggered inflation.
To face these challenges, we tried to source goods from  various places without hoarding excessive inventory  through a well-structured supply chain network.
We  renegotiated partnerships and prices and made early  purchases as a hedging initiative.
We also looked  for alternative raw materials and supply sources as  precautions.
The increase in global oil prices resulted in increased  logistics costs.
We tried to overcome this by working with  more logistic providers, optimising existing networks to  reduce the number of trips, and creating distribution  centres in Java and other areas to be more efficient.
Rantai Pasokan Supply Chain 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
We made two critical transformations in 2022.
The first  was an integrated operational transformation to build  future capabilities our competitors lacked.
The second  was transforming our manufacturing base to become  more agile in production time and digitally integrated.
In 2022, we also significantly reduced the slow-moving  inventory so that 2023 could start without being  burdened by unused or slow-moving items.
By optimising the supply side and inventory, Unilever  Indonesia was able to provide better service to  customers and consumers at a lower cost.
One of the main priorities in 2022 is the implementation  of E-Everything across all business lines, including Digital  & Data Driven capabilities.
With this, we could transform  business processes from upstream to downstream,  reduce complexity, integrate operations, and deliver  data, insights, and technology to achieve excellent  customer experiences.
Customer Development, Supply  Chain, and Finance elements became more efficient  and effective, creating more value for customers and  consumers. 04_Unilever AR 2022_MDNA.
