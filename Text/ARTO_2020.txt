Global Economy The Covid-19 pandemic, which began to be widespread in  February 2020, caused a significant slowdown in the global  economy.
In the first half of 2020, China, the world’s largest  exporter, had to halt its factories’ operations to limit the  outbreak of Covid-19.
The halting of manufacturing activities  hampered global supply chains, which led the IMF to revise  its global economic growth projection in its World Economic  Outlook  (WEO) publication from 3.3% at the beginning of the  year to -4.9% in June 2020.
Even so, the gradually improving global economic situation  following the loosening of restrictions on social activities in  various countries as well as the positive results of vaccine  tests prompted the IMF in October 2020 to once again revise  its GDP growth projection to -4.4%.
Almost all countries  recorded negative economic growth, with only China among  all G-20 countries that managed to record a positive figure,  albeit the lowest growth figure in 44 years.
The Covid-19 pandemic has widely impacted the  economic conditions, both globally and nationally,  to face various challenges.
Perbaikan  ekonomi yang terus membaik juga turut mengangkat nilai Indonesia’s Economy Indonesia’s economic growth, which in the first quarter  was still positive, amounting to 2.97% YoY (year-on-year),  was eventually impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the second and third quarters, negative growth was  recorded at -5.32% YoY and -3.49% YoY.
The negative  growth in these two consecutive quarters means that  Indonesia entered its recession for the first time since the  1998 financial crisis.
Nevertheless, the economic recovery  continued, resulting in a more attenuated negative growth  recorded in the fourth quarter, i.
This was due to  the rollout of the government’s stimulus package and positive  contributions from the external sectors.
To prevent further spread of Covid-19, the Indonesian  government imposed Large-Scale Social Restrictions  (PSBB) which brought an inevitable impact on the national  economic slowdown.
The imposition of PSBB caused  economic contraction, with household consumption  shrinking by -5.52% YoY and -4.04% YoY respectively in  the second and third quarters.
Monthly inflation, which was  0.39% in January 2020, continued to decline as a result of  the imposition of PSBB, reaching its lowest point of -0.10%  in July 2020.
After that, the economic recovery process  began to show results, driving the monthly inflation rate  slowly up.
Thus, inflation in 2020 was recorded as the lowest  in Indonesia’s history, at 1.68%.
The Covid-19 pandemic also caused the rupiah exchange  rate against the USD to fluctuate and depreciate throughout  2020.
After being relatively stable at the beginning of the  year, with an average rate of Rp13,732/USD in January 2020,  the Rupiah’s exchange rate continued to depreciate owing  to the outflow of foreign capital.
Rupiah fell to its lowest  point of Rp16,741/USD in April 2020.
In response to this  situation, the Government and Bank Indonesia (BI) issued  various policies in the form of fiscal stimulus and banking  interventions, so that the Rupiah’s exchange rate gradually  recovered.
BI’s monetary policy to overcome the economic slowdown  caused by Covid-19 while simultaneously safeguarding the  national economic stability was in line with The Fed’s policy.
As the Fed Rate was lowered to 0.25% in March 2020, BI also  cut the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) five times  throughout 2020, reaching 3.75% by the end of the year.
In addition, OJK as the regulator of the financial services  sector also launched a credit restructuring policy to maintain  stability in this sector.
The credit restructuring policy,  originally planned to be implemented until March 2021, has  proven successful in its intended function of protecting the  financial services sector from significant economic pressures,  and was therefore extended to March 2022.
The launch of several programs by the government to  accelerate the national economic recovery began to show  results in the third quarter.
One of the supporting factors  for improvement in macroeconomic indicators was the  accelerated realization of state spending in the third quarter,  which grew by 9.8% YoY, compared to -6.9% YoY in the second  quarter.
Owing to various recovery efforts initiated by the  government, household consumption growth recorded  improving in the fourth quarter, in line with improvements in  public mobility.
In addition, government consumption also  recorded a positive growth throughout 2020 of 1.94%, driven  by the stimulus package, which mainly took the form of social  assistance, spending on other goods and services, as well as  Transfers to Regional and Village Funds (TKDD).
On the whole,  Indonesia’s total economy in 2020 contracted by -2.07% YoY.
The continuing national economic recovery as a result of  increased export performance, private and government  consumption, as well as investment from both government  capital expenditures and foreign direct investment as  a positive response to the Job Creation Law (passed in  November 2020) are the main factors behind Indonesia’s  economic growth projection at 4–5% in 2021.
Various  economic stimuli provided by the government and increased  demand in 2021 are expected to send inflation back up to  the target set by BI, which is 3±1%.
Meanwhile, the Fed’s  74 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights ditetapkan BI, yakni 3±1%.
dovish monetary policy, controlled domestic inflation, and  the projected current account deficit in 2021 are expected to  enable BI to maintain the BI7DRR benchmark interest rate in  the range of 3.5–3.75% in 2021.
Banking Industry Development In the banking sector, lending has slowed due to reduced  consumption and policies of many business owners to hold  back business expansion.
As a result, the total amount of  credit disbursement by the end of 2020 was recorded at  -2.41% YoY.
Meanwhile, third party funds (DPK) until the end of  December 2020 were recorded to have increased by 11.11%,  as market participants endeavored to maintain liquidity.
Among BUKU 2 banks, total loans disbursed reached  Rp539.01 trillion by end of 2020, a decline of 5.29% compared  with the amount at the end of 2019.
However, third party  funds rose to Rp648.87 trillion by end of 2020, up 4.47% from  its value as at the end of 2019.
Even though lending growth was slowing down, financial  ratios show that the stability of the national banking system  is still maintained.
The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of banks  as of the end of 2020 was recorded at a high 23.81% while the  non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remains below the 5% limit,  namely 3.06% for NPL gross and 0.98% for NPL net.
Among BUKU 2 banks, CAR at the end of 2020 was recorded  at 24.57%, lower than the value as at the end of 2019, which  stood at 25.44%.
Throughout the same period, NPL improved  from 3.45% at the end of 2019 to 3.18%.
Profitability based on return on assets (ROA) continued to  decline since March 2020 to 1.59% as at the end of 2020,  compared to 2.47% in the previous year.
In addition, slowing  demand for credit also affected the net interest margin (NIM),  which decreased to 4.45%, from 4.91% at the end of 2019.
Among BUKU 2 banks, ROA declined from 1.42% as at the  end of 2019 to 1.31% as at the end of 2020, and NIM likewise  declined from 4.81% to 4.57% over the same period. 75 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2020 Integrated Annual Report PT Bank Jago TbkKeberlanjutan | Sustainability Tata Kelola Perusahaan | Corporate Governance Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen | Management Discussion and Analysis Tinjauan Bisnis Business Review Transformasi Digital Tahun 2020 merupakan tahun yang transformatif bagi  Bank Jago.
Digital Transformation The year 2020 was a truly transformative year for Bank Jago.
With PT Metamorfosis Ekosistem Indonesia (MEI) and  Wealth Track Technology Limited (WTT) as the controlling  shareholders upon acquiring the majority of shares in the  Bank in 2019, in 2020, Bank Jago underwent a massive,  across-the-board transformation process that paved the  way for the Bank into becoming a tech-based bank.
In line  with the mandate from its shareholders, in 2020 Bank Jago’s  management strategically made a substantial investment  in digital technology and infrastructure to initiate the  transformation journey.
Not only changing the main mechanism that underpins  its operations, the transformation also changed the Bank’s  target market, turning the focus of its financial products  and services towards the middle-income and mass-market  segmentations.
This year has been a transformative year for us.
Throughout 2020, Jago build the essential building  blocks to become a technology-based bank.
The newly-transformed Bank Jago now has four main  strengths that will make it unique, unparalleled, and therefore  successful in the market.
These are: 1.
Leading-edge tech capability,  3.
Strong ecosystem partnership, and  4.
Highly competent people and culture.
With digital technology in its business DNA, the Bank is  reinventing the currently prevailing “digital banking” trend  into a “life-centric” banking approach.
This life-centricity  emboldens the Bank to offer practical solutions (“lifestyle  use cases”) to a multitude of issues often encountered by  the Indonesian consumers, from seamless payments to  hassle-free savings allocation.
At the same time, Bank Jago’s  technology will be geared towards promoting collaboration  between its users in the most intuitive ways imaginable.
Given the rapid growth of digital economy in Indonesia,  providing digital banking services will empower the Bank  to exponentially widen its market and gain access to a vastly  greater customer base with its own promising potentials.
Transformed Banking Operations In 2020, the Bank’s main strategy was developing an  innovative, safe, and flexible digital platform as a foundation  to launch the Bank’s digital services.
The Bank had built the  infrastructure needed to support its day-to-day operations,  ranging from risk management, transactions and processing  to human resources management.
As regards physical operations, Bank Jago took a major step  in 2020 by centralizing its operations to the new head office in  Jakarta.
The transformation into a tech-based bank required  the Bank to establish a new operations team for formulating  and enhancing its digital banking offerings.
Focusing its  operations on a single location was therefore beneficial for  honing and integrating the mastery of its digital banking  operations team, as it strengthens its position as a center  of excellence within the Bank.
Furthermore, establishing a  centralized operations center enables the Bank to manage  its capacity planning and load balancing of its branch offices  in a more efficient manner, allowing the few existing branch  offices to focus more on serving the customers.
As a result, in 2020 the Bank discontinued the operations of  two branch offices while it maintained its participation in the  country-wide ATM Bersama and ALTO networks.
To ensure compliance with the prevailing know your customer  (KYC) standards and processes, the Bank harnesses its  technological capability in executing and strengthening its  KYC-related processes.
The Bank has established a data  science team to improve the Bank’s insights on its customers  as well as ensure the legality of all transactions taking place  on its platforms.
Business Performance In 2020, Bank Jago’s primary business activities consisted of  collecting third party funds and channelling them back in the  form of loans and financing.
The Bank’s total customer deposits/third party funds as  at end of 2020 reached Rp804 billion, an increase of 34%  from Rp599 billion as at end of 2019.
This was mainly due  to increase in time deposits and current accounts from  corporations at end of 2020.
Furthermore, in March 2020,  the Bank raised Rp1.34 trillion from its first rights issue.
And  with the additional paid-up capital from the proceeds, the  Bank entered the BUKU II banking group.
Excess funding  from the rights issue has been placed in securities, such as  SBI, RR and SBN.
This way, the Bank can reduce the portion  of high-interest third party funding as it further expands  credit disbursement.
From the lending side, the highlight in 2020 was that, amidst  the blow to the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic,  the Bank managed to reduce its NPL to near zero through  the sale of its bad and doubtful loans, which was carried  out over the course of the year.
The Bank also developed  partnership lending business with two acquisition models in  2020: institutional partnership and value chain (corporate  ecosystem) models.
In the institutional partnership model,  the Bank successfully partnered with three multifinance  companies and three peer-to-peer lending institutions.
Meanwhile, in the value chain model, the Bank forged  strategic partnerships with two corporations in the form of  invoice financing for suppliers.
The new partnerships forged by the Bank to ramp up its  lending performance had paid off.
By the end of 2020,  the partnership lending business managed to boost credit  disbursement reaching total loans of Rp524 billion, an  increase of about 2110% from Rp24 billion in December  2019.
These loans were provided to the three P2P lending  institutions (Rp382 billion in total) and three multifinance  companies (Rp127 billion), as mentioned above, as well as  to rural banks (Rp15 billion). 79 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2020 Integrated Annual Report PT Bank Jago TbkKeberlanjutan | Sustainability Tata Kelola Perusahaan | Corporate Governance Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen | Management Discussion and Analysis Selain itu, Bank juga menyalurkan pinjaman kepada korporasi  sejumlah Rp200 miliar melalui mekanisme perjanjian  bilateral.
In addition, the Bank also disbursed Rp200 billion in loans  to corporations through bilateral agreements, while in 2019  the Bank had not engaged this channel.
Meanwhile, legacy  loans from Bank Artos managed by its SME Banking in 2020  continued to decline by 29%, from Rp261 billion in 2019 to  Rp184 billion.
Such a strong overall lending growth was grounded upon  the Bank’s determined effort to continue disbursing  loans with ample prudence, following the improvement  of Indonesia’s economic situation in the second half of  2020.
As a result, total loans as at end of 2020 amounted to  Rp908 billion, up by 219% from Rp285 billion in the previous  year.
The Bank also maintained healthy credit quality with  zero NPL by the end of 2020.
Digital Banking The Bank’s vision to develop digital banking services for  the middle-income and mass-market segments has been  embodied in its product—to be launched in 2021—called  Jago digital banking app.
Powered by leading-edge  technology, Jago digital banking app will be the new face of  the Bank, specifically developed for the consumer segment  and focusing on providing banking-related solutions to  the Indonesian mass-market.
Jago digital banking app is designed to be the most  comprehensive, fully-integrated payment solution for  Indonesia and beyond.
Its essential features will range from  P2P transfers, wallet top-up, billers, and QRIS payments, to a  broad range of tools to set, manage, and achieve savings and  investment goals.
Pockets is one of the unique features offered by Jago digital  banking app.
Through Pockets, users can allocate their  savings into various accounts.
The app will also be connected  to various digital partners, including e-money, e-wallet,  e-commerce, dan digital lifestyle providers.
Through this  integration, the Bank strives to be the “everyday hero” that  has solutions at hand to make life easier for customers in  meeting their daily needs in banking and financing. 80 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights Teknologi Informasi Information Technology Pada tahun 2020 Bank melakukan investasi yang signifikan  dalam membangun kemampuan digital dan teknologi  informasi (TI).
Oleh karena itu Bank In 2020, the Bank made a significant investment in digital  capabilites and information technology (IT).
The aim is  to build a solid foundation so that it can swiftly bring its digital  services to the customers.
Bank Jago’s Tech-Based Banking Model To become an innovative, tech-based digital bank, it is  imperative that the Bank has the appropriate blueprint and  architecture that has at its core the adoption of cutting- edge technology.
This is to ensure that the Bank can develop  fast, easy, secure, and efficient services for its customers.
As a tech-based bank, Bank Jago has to develop the latest  technologies as the main driver of its businesses.
The Bank therefore is committed to continuously develop its  IT with a focus on developing four main pillars: 1.
deploying mobile application for customers’ use; 2.
developing products, services, and processes by building  versatile and reusable microservices; 3.
utilizing core banking services from reputable and reliable  Software as a Service (SaaS) providers; and 4.
developing data analytics capabilities by setting up a  data lake, data warehouse and other related analytics  services to produce new information and insights thereby  improving decision-making.
The main service to be provided is the digital platform for  consumer and business customers, both in conventional  as well as sharia method.
The digital platform for the business segment will be  complemented with many non-financial features, integrated  from third party providers, to fulfill the business needs of the  typical MSME customer.
Review of IT Infrastructure and Systems  in 2020 In building its IT foundation, in 2020 the Bank established  an IT organization supported by highly-qualified and  experienced team members in implementing various digital  technology systems and infrastructure.
The Bank has completed the initial development of the  consumer digital financial platform which provides innovative  digital banking services.
The application is built using the  latest programming language, applied in the form of reusable  microservices which interconnects using application  programming interfaces (API).
For the standard capabilities that doesn’t directly provide  competitive advantage the Bank’s approach is to utilize  services from third party providers.
This approach delivers  better efficiencies, reduces operational overhead and  improves implementation times.
Mainly this is implemented  for the new cloud based core banking system which supports  the digital transaction services.
In addition the Bank also uses  other third party services for the data infrastructure platform  for the Data Lake and the Data Warehouse, as well as for the  Switching, Card Management and ATM Controller.
The Bank also built two bespoke server sites to support  running its banking regulatory reporting system.
Data security is non-negotiable for the Bank, and therefore  the Bank has taken a number of steps to address this issue.
The Bank has implemented Secure Content Delivery Network  service to fulfill the design of a defense-in-depth-based  security architecture.
This includes the implementation of  a web application firewall (WAF), prevention of distributed  denial of service (DDoS), mTLS Authentication for certain  business partners, and Rate Limiter to protect API endpoints  listed on the public Internet.
To mitigate other related  risks, the Bank engaged independent third parties to  run penetration tests against the Bank’s digital financial  transaction application.
The Bank has revamped its information security governance  and built a security information and event management  (SIEM) capability on cloud to detect any potential security  breaches within a brief window of time.
The Bank has also  updated its information technology governance process,  by implementing restrictions on access rights based on  role-based access control (RBAC), communication or  network access, VPN (virtual private network), and two-factor  authentication (2FA).
IT Development Plans for 2021 To ensure that the IT function always runs well to support the  Bank’s operations as a tech-based bank, the Bank is currently  strengthening various aspects related to IT, including security  against various IT risks, core banking, and data governance.
To expand its product range, the Bank will develop a QRIS  payment system with the Indonesian QR Code standard,  as well as adding a lending feature in the consumer digital  financial application.
The Bank will also develop a Branch  Teller System (BTS) application to serve customers both  conventional and sharia who transact in the branch offices.
For the MSME segment, the Bank will continue to develop the  Partnership Lending system.
For its sharia core banking system, the Bank employs third- party services under the managed services scheme, and at  the same time develops a partner channeling microservices  for integration with systems from sharia financing partners.
In line with the implementation of the new core banking, the  Bank will develop an additional sharia regulatory reporting  system.
Furthermore, the Bank has plans to develop new  products in its sharia core banking (Qardh, Mudharabah), and  balloon payment installment feature.
In the core banking aspect, the Bank will migrate its current  Wincore system to the Mambu Core Banking system, as  well as migrating its ATM Host (PNN) to Euronet.
In Data  Management, the Bank will improve data infrastructure  through additional data sources, developing data quality  monitoring tools, and strengthening the extract, transform,  and load (ETL) process.
The Bank will continue to strengthen its data governance,  including with analytical dashboards to make data-based  decision making, as well as adding data services related  to anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud, automatic  transaction classification, and personal financial management  tools.
The Anti-Fraud support system in the onboarding  and transactional processes, along with the KYC, AML, and  Customer Risk Profile systems to automatically calculate  customer risk ratings, will continue to be developed.
And to  continue improving its HR capabilities, the Bank will enhance  its Human Capital (People Experience) application, covering  the overall HR process.
In terms of information security, the Bank will focus on  meeting three main standards: SIEM, endpoint detection  protection response (EDPR), and privileged access  management (PAM).
These three aspects are crucial for the  Bank to protect the information it manages from end to end,  starting from the devices used by customers, and all the way  to data management in the Bank’s data center. 85 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2020 Integrated Annual Report PT Bank Jago TbkKeberlanjutan | Sustainability Tata Kelola Perusahaan | Corporate Governance Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen | Management Discussion and Analysis Tinjauan Keuangan Financial Review We have increased our capital to strengthen our  financial position which enables the Bank to start 2021  with a sound financial condition.
The transformation undertaken by Bank Jago throughout the  year was the main factor affecting its financial performance  in 2020.
Although Bank Jago has succeeded in ramping up  its loans disbursement, the need for significant investment  to support the Bank’s transformation process into a digital- based bank has resulted in other operating expenses  to increase significantly.
As a result, the Bank booked  comprehensive loss in 2020.
This financial performance review has been prepared  based on PT Bank Jago Tbk’s Financial Statements as at 31  December 2020, which have been audited by the Public  Accounting Firm Tanudiredja, Wibisana, Rintis & Rekan in  accordance with the Independent Auditor’s Report No.  00284/2.1025/AU.1/07/0734-1/1/III/2021 dated 10 March 2021  with the opinion that the accompanying financial statements  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  PT Bank Jago Tbk as of 31 December 2020, and its financial  performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in  accordance with Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards.

This increase was caused by a surge in total loans – net,  amounting to Rp574.5 billion.
In addition, the Bank also  recorded a notable increase in intangible assets – net by  Rp150.1 billion and in securities by Rp118.2 billion in 2020.
A significant decrease in the Bank’s assets as of the end  of 2020 occurred in securities purchased under resale  agreements, amounting to Rp316.2 billion.
The largest contributor to total assets at the end of 2020  was loans - net, which reached Rp826.2 billion or 37.9% of  the Bank’s total assets.
Meanwhile, Rp1.7 trillion or 76.9%  of the Bank’s total assets as of 31 December 2020 were  productive assets.

Lending was mostly allocated for working capital loans  amounting to Rp491.3 billion (54.1% of the total loans).
The  Bank also provided consumption loans to its customers.
The consumption loans amount surged from Rp10.9 billion  in 2019 to Rp407.8 billion by the end of 2020.
Disbursement  of working capital loans and consumption loans, which rose  significantly, was driven by the Bank’s lending business via  its partnerships, which was successfully cultivated by the  Bank over the course of 2020.
Meanwhile, the amount of  investment loans decreased by Rp10.0 billion or 53.1% from its  amount at the end of 2019.
Even though the Bank succeeded in increasing the size of  its total loans disbursed, the Covid-19 pandemic caused  a deterioration in the quality of debt as the businesses of  some of the Bank’s debtors were experiencing difficulty in  maintaining healthy cash and liquidity positions.
As a result,  there was a decline in the value of financial assets as seen  from the allowance for impairment losses (CKPN) which  increased by Rp48.6 billion at the end of 2020.
All loans disbursed in 2020 were given to third parties.
The Bank’s liabilities in 2020 rose 48.1% from Rp639.9 billion in  2019 to Rp947.5 billion.
Other liabilities also rose, due to higher  accrued personnel expenses, amounting to Rp45.1 billion.
The biggest increase in liabilities occurred in deposits in the  form of current accounts, which amounted to Rp182.8 billion  at the end of 2020, to become 7.4 times its position at the end  of 2019.
The largest component in total liabilities by the end of 2020  was deposits in the form of time deposit, which amounted to  Rp585.3 billion or 61.8% of the Bank’s total liabilities.
Total Funding In 2020, the Bank succeeded in increasing total customer  deposits by 34.2% from Rp599.1 billion at the end of 2019 to  Rp803.9 billion.
This increase was mainly due to the soaring  current accounts (639.4%), an increase in time deposits by  19.8%, while the amount of total deposits held in savings  declined decreased by 58.2%.
The composition of third-party funds held in the Bank as at  the end of 2020 was as follows: 72.8% time deposits, 22.7%  current accounts, and 4.5% savings. 90 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights Ekuitas Dinyatakan dalam jutaan Rupiah, kecuali dinyatakan lain Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated Deskripsi   Description 2020 2019* +/- +/- (%) Ekuitas Equity Modal saham Share capital1.085.625 120.625 965.000 800,0% Agio saham Share premium366.407 4.482 361.925 8.075,1% Cadangan umum Statutory reserves9.000 9.000 - 0% Tambahan modal disetor Additional paid-in capital169 169 - 0% Dana setoran modal Capital deposit funds100.000 682.858 (582.858) -85,4% Penghasilan komprehensif lainnya Other comprehensive income Cadangan nilai wajar bersih - efek-efek  yang diukur pada nilai wajar melalui  penghasilan komprehensif lain Net fair value reserve - securities  measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income 2.126 - 2.126 100,0% Pengukuran kembali liabilitas imbalan  kerja Remeasurement of employee benefits  liabilities1.472 3.702 (2.230) -60,2% Surplus revaluasi aset tetap Revaluation surplus of fixed assets8.152 37.567 (29.415) -78,3% Saldo defisit Accumulated deficit(340.618) (177.224) (163.394) 92,2% Jumlah Ekuitas Total Equity1.232.333 681.179 551.154 80,9% * Direklasifikasi, lihat Catatan 45 atas Laporan Keuangan.

As a result, at the  end of 2020 the Bank recorded total comprehensive loss of  Rp189.7 billion, and loss for the year of Rp189.6 billion.
As a result, basic loss per share for 2020 reached Rp22.49 per  share.

Rasio Keuangan Penting Kecukupan Modal Deskripsi   Description 2020 2019 Permodalan   Capital Rasio Kewajiban Penyediaan Modal Minimum (KPMM)  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)91,38% 148,28%The Bank’s cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of  2020 was recorded at Rp303.5 billion, while at the end of the  year it was recorded to increase by 47.5% to Rp447.5 billion.
Cash flow for investment activities in 2020 experienced an  exceedingly high increase, from Rp2.0 billion in 2019 to Rp265.0  billion, or more than 130 times.
This increase was contributed  by cash outflows for the acquisition of intangible assets and the  acquisition of fixed assets, with a value of Rp150.3 billion and  Rp51.2 billion, respectively, in 2020.
Such acquisitions required  a significant amount of funding in order to support the ongoing  transformation of the Bank into a digital bank.
From its operating activities, the Bank recorded a decrease in  cash outflows from Rp503.3 billion to Rp327.2 billion in 2020,  due to the efficiencies in the Bank’s business processes.
The main cash outflows were for loans, which amounted to  Rp644.2 billion in 2020.
The Bank recorded an increase in cash inflows from financing  activities to Rp736.1 billion, from Rp682.9 billion.

In 2020, the Bank’s CAR decreased compared to the  previous year.
This was due to the increase in its risk- weighted assets (RWA) because of loans expansion.
In addition, a significant amount of investment in fixed  assets in 2020 led to an increase in the Fixed Assets to  Equity ratio in 2020, which reached 11.17%.

In establishing its capital  policy, the Bank upholds the principle of prudence, such  as by diversifying capital sources in line with its long-term  strategic plan.
Thus, the Bank can efficiently allocate capital  to business segment that can provide the most optimal risk- return profile, to meet the expectations of the stakeholders,  including investors and regulators.
The Bank’s capital adequacy is measured using Capital  Adequacy Ratio (CAR), which is the ratio of capital to risk- weighted assets (RWA).
The Bank’s CAR as at 31 December  2020 taking into account credit, operational, and market risks  was 91.38%.
Although it decreased compared to 2019, the  Bank’s CAR in 2020 remained much higher than the threshold  for CAR based on risk profile at 10% as set by the OJK.
In 2020, the Bank succeeded in reducing its NPL to virtually  zero, through the sale of its bad and doubtful loans.
This  resulted in a decrease in the ratio of Non-Performing Earning  Assets to Total Earning Assets, which also fell to zero percent.
However, the Covid-19 pandemic had caused a negative  impact on economic conditions, and pushed down the  amount of the Bank’s financial assets, so that the Bank to  increase its allowances.
Thus, there was an increase in the  ratio of Allowance for Impairment Losses (CKPN) on Financial  Assets to Earning Assets, reaching 4.87%.
Debt Paying Ability and Collectibility  of Receivables The Bank measures its ability to pay short-term and long- term obligations through several ratios, such as liquidity  ratio, solvency ratio, and profitability ratio.
These ratios are  parameters that are constantly monitored to calculate the  Bank’s ability to provide liquidity reserves.
In terms of solvency, the Bank’s capital ratio, which is  measured by Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), shows a  particularly strong position at the level of 91.38%.
Even though  it has decreased compared to the previous year, this figure  was still above the minimum CAR stipulated by the regulator.
Meanwhile, in terms of liquidity, the ratio of liabilities to assets  and equity improved compared to 2019, reaching 43.47% and  76.89% in 2020, respectively. 100 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights Pada tahun 2020, Bank memiliki tingkat kolektibilitas yang  sangat baik.
In 2020, the Bank maintained an excellent level of  collectibility.
The collectibility of current accounts with other  banks, placements with Bank Indonesia and other banks, as  well as securities as at 31 December 2020 were all classified  as current, based on Bank Indonesia collectibility.
No balance  was blocked or used as collateral as at said date.
Of the total Rp908.0 billion of loans granted in 2020, 96.0% or  Rp872.0 billion were categorized as current and the remaining  4.0% or Rp35.9 billion were in the category of special mention.
There were no loans that were categorized as substandard,  doubtful, or loss.
Profitability The profitability ratio used to determine the level of the Bank’s  profitability performance is measured using four components,  namely Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Net  Interest Margin (NIM), and Operating Expenses to Operating  Income (BOPO).
In 2020, although ROA and ROE were still  recorded negative, namely -11.27% and -18.03%, respectively,  their values had improved compared to 2019, especially the  ROE ratio.
This was made possible because the Bank’s assets  and equity of have increased owing to additional capital  in 2020.
In addition, the Bank’s NIM improved to 4.74% in 2020  compared to 2.05% in 2019.
The improvement in this ratio  is in line with the Bank’s improving operating performance,  as reflected in the increase in interest income and lower  interest expenses.
Meanwhile, the Bank’s BOPO in 2020 was  still considered high, at 261.10%.
Liquidity The liquidity ratio used to determine the Bank’s ability to meet  its key obligations and liquidity risk is measured using several  indicators, namely Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR), Current and  Saving Accounts (CASA), and the ratios of liabilities to equity  and liabilities to assets.
In 2020, the Bank recorded a sharp increase in LDR, from  47.54% in 2019 to 111.07% in 2020.
This was due to credit  distribution which increased significantly by 218.81% in 2020,  while growth in third party funds only amounted to 34.20%.
The Bank also recorded an increase in CASA ratio from 18.45%  in 2019 to 27.20%, which resulted in lower interest expenses  paid by the Bank.
In addition, the Bank also succeeded in reducing its ratios  of liabilities to equity and liabilities to assets, both of which  showed stronger solvency of the Bank.  102 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights Kepatuhan Kepatuhan  Compliance 2020 2019 a.

The Bank also managed to maintain its Macroprudential  Liquidity Buffer (PLM) position of 63.49%, well above the OJK  regulation for minimum PLM of 6%.
Interest Rates Commercial banks that carry out conventional business  activities have the obligation to report and publish their  Prime Lending Rates (SBDK) in Rupiah as stipulated in OJK  Regulation No. 32/POJK.03/2016 on Transparency and  Publication of Bank Reports.
The Bank reports and publishes  its Prime Lending Rates to provide clarity to customers and  facilitate customers in weighing the benefits, costs, and  risks of credit offered in addition to improving corporate  governance and driving market discipline.
Bank Jago periodically reviewed its Prime Lending Rates  through the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings,  and published the rates quarterly through national  newspapers throughout 2020.
Management Policies For Capital Structure In line with OJK Regulation, the Bank’s capital structure  consists of the Core Capital (Tier 1) and Supplementary  Capital (Tier 2).
Core Capital (Tier 1) consists of paid-up capital, other  comprehensive income which comprises the changes in the  fair value of financial assets available for sale and the surplus  from the revaluation of fixed assets, other capital additional  reserves in the form of share premiums, general reserves,  previous years loss and current year loss, differences  between required provision and allowance for impairment  losses for non-earning assets, and deductionary components  of capital, consisting of intangible assets.
Supplementary Capital (Tier 2) mainly consists of required  provision for earning assets at a maximum of 1.25% of the Risk- Weighted Assets.
The objective of the Bank’s capital management is to  maintain a strong capital position to support business growth  and maintain investors, depositors, customers, and market  confidence.
In managing capital, the Bank considers factors  such as: optimal return on capital to the shareholders;  balance between higher profit and gearing ratio; as well as  the security provided by a sound capital position.
Banks are required to meet the requirements for the Capital  Adequacy Ratio (CAR) set by Bank Indonesia and the OJK  which consider quantitative aspects, such as assets, liabilities,  and certain off balance sheet accounts, as well as qualitative  considerations of components and weighted risk.
CAR is an indicator to determine the soundness and capital  of a bank.
The Bank’s CAR as of 31 December 2020 was  91.38%.
Meanwhile, the ratio of the Bank’s Core Capital to  Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), which was 90.54% at the end of  2020, was far above the minimum requirements set by OJK in  POJK No. 11/POJK.03/2016, which is 10%.
Thus, the Bank has complied with Bank Indonesia and  OJK regulations in the area of capital.
After establishing a digital banking platform and preparing its  IT infrastructure to transform into a tech-based bank in 2020,  the Bank is now ready to grow with a new business model that  is digital and technology-based in 2021.
The market segments to be cultivated as the Bank’s  main target in 2021 are middle-income and mass-market  segments, serving customers in the Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprises (MSMEs) and consumer segments, in both  conventional and sharia banking.
As the Bank prepares to launch its service for the consumer  segment in 2021, the Bank also continues to develop a service  for the MSME and the sharia segment.
The Bank will continue  to develop the Jago digital banking app by expanding the  features and services provided so that it will further enrich  the customer experience in performing banking transactions  through this application.
To provide more valuable services to its customers, Bank Jago  plans to upgrade its status to become a foreign exchange  bank.
Upgrading its status to a foreign exchange bank  will strengthen the Bank’s non-Rupiah funding structure,  allowing for alternative funding.
In addition, the Bank can  also provide foreign exchange services for the consumer  and SME segments, especially those related to export-import  transactions.
Another key aspect that will continue to be developed  by Bank Jago is the strengthening the Bank’s position in  expanding more liberally while simultaneously increasing  the intensity of cooperation and synergy with its ecosystem  partners in a sustainable way.
PT Dompet Karya Anak Bangsa (GoPay)’s investment in the  Bank is an example of an opportunity the Bank will harness to  amplify its business growth, by consolidating various service  offerings from Gojek business group and providing access to  Gojek’s exceptionally large and valuable customer base.
Apart  from opening up some impactful opportunities, this strategy  also poses a challenge for the Bank to develop attractive  products and services for potential customers.
Moreover, Bank Jago is currently looking into other strategic  opportunities to continue expanding the digital ecosystem  and provide a more comprehensive service to our customers.
Another effort that is also crucial for the Bank to improve the  foundation of its business as a tech-based bank is improving  risk management and good corporate governance (GCG).
The Bank will deploy various risk management and Anti-Fraud  tools as well as enhancing its governance documentation and  policies in accordance with the applicable regulations and  industry best practices.
Based on an assumption that the economic situation will  continue to face immense challenges from the Covid-19  pandemic, and taking into account the above strategies,  for 2021 the Bank is targeting an asset growth of 190% from  its position at the end of 2020.
The target will be achieved  through credit and financing (sharia) growth of up to 259%  and third party funds up to 138%, along with net profit of  Rp50 billion.
The Bank also aims to significantly increase  its equity through a rights issue in the first quarter of 2021  that will have made up around two-thirds of its total assets by  the end of 2021, pushing its ROE above 1%. 108 Profil Perusahaan | Company Profile Laporan Manajemen | Management Report Ikhitisar 2020 | 2020 Highlights Aspek Pemasaran Marketing Aspect Sasaran pasar dari produk dan layanan perbankan yang  Bank Jago tawarkan adalah segmen mass-market  dan UMKM.
The target market for Bank Jago’s banking products and  services comprise the mass-market and MSME segments.
In  Indonesia, these two segments are both dominant drivers of  economic activity, due to the disproportionately large role of  the informal sector and the MSME sector in shoring up the  country’s economic growth.
The market size of these two segments is prodigiously  large.
In 2020, the number of MSMEs was estimated to be  upwards of 65 million businesses, contributing to more than  50% of Indonesia’s GDP and employing 97% of the total  active workforce in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, of the total adult  population of Indonesia, Bain & Company in its 2019 report  estimated that 92 million people (more than 50%) had not  had any access to banking products and services (and thus  dubbed as the unbanked population), while around 47 million  people (more than 25%) did not have adequate access to  banking services (the underbanked population).
This situation  signifies a promising market potential for Bank Jago to  cultivate its business in these two segments.
Product marketing is conducted in a digital ecosystem that  will be managed by two business units, namely: the SME  Banking business and the Partnership Lending business  (Business Finance Solution).
The SME Banking business  will manage the SME partnership credit portfolio through  channeling as well as the pre-acquisition loan portfolio, most  of which are MSME loans (traditional SME) in the form of  working capital and investment loans.
In line with the digital  bank initiative, the Bank will build a financing business with  a focus on building mutually beneficial digital ecosystem  collaborations with digital players managed through the  Partnership Lending (Business Finance Solution) business.
Bank Jago continues to intensify its marketing activities  through digital channels, consistent with its transformation  into a digital-based bank.
The launching of Jago digital  banking app in 2021 will deliver a seamless digital banking  transaction experience for its customers.
This also will open  new avenues for the Bank to introduce major breakthroughs  in marketing its products and services, which it will continue  to enrich and enhance in the future. 109 Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2020 Integrated Annual Report PT Bank Jago TbkKeberlanjutan | Sustainability Tata Kelola Perusahaan | Corporate Governance Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen | Management Discussion and Analysis Dividen Dividends Penggunaan Dana Hasil Penawaran Umum Use of Public Offering ProceedsKebijakan Dividen Kebijakan pembagian dan penetapan dividen menjadi  kewenangan Pemegang Saham dan ditetapkan di dalam  RUPS Tahunan.

Tax Compliance Bank Jago contributes to the national development through  timely and accurate payment of taxes, in accordance with  its obligation as a corporate taxpayer and tax collector  on behalf of the state.
Changes in regulations that have been in effect since 2020  and had an impact on the Bank’s operations in 2020 were: 1.
POJK No. 11/POJK.03/2020 on the National Economic  Stimulus as a Countercyclical Policy on the Impact of the  Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 2.
POJK No. 48/POJK.03/2020 on the Amendments to  OJK Regulation No. 11/POJK.03/2020 on the National  Economic Stimulus as a Countercyclical Policy on the  Impact of the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 In relation to the enactment of the abovementioned OJK  regulations, the Bank had made adjustments in its banking  activities in 2020, through special treatments for its debtors  who have experienced difficulty in fulfilling their debt  payment obligations to the Bank, due to being adversely  affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, either directly or  indirectly, among others those from sectors that have been  severely hit by the pandemic, such as tourism, transportation,  hotels, trading, processing, and others.
The Bank has also strengthened its implementation of risk  management and the principle of prudence among others in  managing its capital and liquidity.
Some of the adjustments  made by the Bank in 2020 were: • Credit/financing quality assessment being based strictly  on the timeliness of principal and/or interest payments,  for financing values of up to Rp10 billion; • Classification of credit/financing quality as “Current”  upon having been restructured; and • Separation of new credit/financing facilities from the  existing ones in terms of their quality determination.
The Management is rolling out the stimulus to support the  banking activities of the Bank, and the banking industry, and  the Government’s programs in general, to generate a positive  impact on the customers and the Bank.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board of the Indonesian  Institute of Accountants (DSAK-IAI) has issued new accounting  standards, effective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: • PSAK 71 “Financial Instruments”, • PSAK 72 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, • PSAK 73 “Leases”.
Of these new and revised standards, PSAK 71 and PSAK 73  had significant impacts to the Bank, while PSAK 72 had little  impact on the Financial Statements in the current year or the  previous year.
PSAK 71 is an update on PSAK 55 (Revised 2014) regarding  “Financial Instruments”: • PSAK 71 changes the basis for the classification and  measurement of financial assets and liabilities from  PSAK 55 which was based on management’s intention  to be based on an assessment of business models and  contractual cash flows, • changes in the principle of recognizing and measuring  allowance for impairment losses on financial instruments  using the expected credit loss model which replaces the  incurred loss model in PSAK 55.
The adoption of PSAK 73: Leases change the recognition  of a lease contract to be recognized as a lease asset from  the original concept based on risk and reward to a control  concept.
In this case, the Bank as the lessee recognizes  the rights-of-use asset if it meets the definition of a lease  based on PSAK 73 and a lease liability if the lease payments  are made periodically.
The exception is short-term leases  or leases with low value assets.
