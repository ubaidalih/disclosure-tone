The year 2023 turned out to be a year that posed numerous challenges and uncertainties that affected the Company’s performance.
IMF in the World Economic Outlook, which was published in January 2024, recorded global economic growth in 2023 of around 3.1%.
Thus, global economic growth in 2023 was recorded to have decreased compared to 3.5% registered in 2022.
Inflation pressure is forecasted to remain high, prompted by the increase in energy and food prices due to the escalation in geopolitical conflicts, economic fragmentation, as well as the El Nino phenomenon.
In order to control inflation, monetary interest rates in developed countries, including the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), are forecasted to remain at high levels for a longer period of time (higher for longer).
Geopolitical tensions also had an impact on global  economic and trade outlooks.
While the war in Ukraine was not over, some other parts of world known for being centers of conflict, such as the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East had also an impact that might have disrupted the global economy and caused the prices of commodity to go even higher.
Such likely occurrence could have further squeezed the global trade and investment outputs and further posed negative impacts especially on developing countries like Indonesia.
Amidst global macroeconomic challenges, the  Indonesian economy has also managed to grow well and shown resilience.
The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) recorded a growth of 5.05% in the national economy, while it stood at 5.31% in 2022.
The main contributor for this growth is an increase in household consumption, which is the largest component of Indonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which grew by 4.82 percent in 2023.
The increase in the minimum wage and government social assistance are driving the increase in household consumption.
Another factor is growth in investment, which reached 4.4% in 2023, which was contributed by the realization of infrastructure development in Indonesia.
In line with the strong economic trend, the Company continues to seek positive trends in performance.
The commercial gas sales volume in 2023 reached 923 BBTUD, while the natural gas transmission amounted to 1,458 MMSCFD.
The upstream oil and gas segment continues to exhibit positive performance, with a lifting volume of 9.2 MMBOE.
The volume of natural gas regasification increased to 158 BBTUD from 144 BBTUD in the same period in the previous year.
A significant achievement occurred in the oil transportation, which reached 155,775 BOEPD, compared to the same period in the previous year, which only reached 38,471 BOEPD.
Furthermore, regarding the number of customers,  In its role as Pertamina Gas Subholding, PGN consistently  emphasizes the quality of services to customers through the provision of natural gas supply, infrastructure, and sustainable innovations.
Diversification of gas supplies in the form of CNG and LNG to assist the reliability of natural gas supplies in the future is being sought to enhance the reliability of domestic natural gas.
The Gas Subholding will continue to ensure growing  performance by implementing various initiatives, including optimization strategies through addition of customers and market penetration, expansion of household services, business diversification to support the Company’s business sustainability through the development of downstream gas derivative businesses, effective cost management, as well as sustainable Human Resources (HR) development. 171 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.

Performance of Other Business Segments in terms  of Revenue/ProfitabilityTINJAUAN OPERASI PER SEGMEN USAHA Operational Review Per Business Segment Laporan Tahunan 2023 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk 182 04.
In 2023, revenue from other business segments reached USD426.5 million or up 52.1%, from USD280.4 million in 2022.
The increase in revenue was contributed by stronger performance in almost all business activities in other business segments, e.
an increase in oil transportation volume, regasification, and other lines.
The increase shows the Company’s success in developing other businesses than its core of natural gas trading and transmission.
The profitability of other business segments increased  by 35.6% or USD64.0 million compared to the previous year in line with the increase in revenue. 183 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.
The following financial performance analysis has been prepared based on the Consolidated Financial Report of PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk and Subsidiaries ended on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
The Consolidated Financial Report was prepared by management in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards applicable in Indonesia, and had been audited by KAP Purwantono, Sungkoro & Surja, a member firm of the Ernst & Young Global Limited network, with an audit opinion presents fairly in all material respects.
In general, consolidated financial performance in 2023  remained positive.
This can be seen from the current year’s profit of USD278.1 million attributable to the owners of the parent entity compared to USD326.2 million reached in the previous year.
In terms of financial position achievements, the Company managed to record total assets of USD 6,599.2 million, down 8.3% compared to the previous year’s USD 7,194.9 million.
This financial performance was achieved in line with the company’s efforts to increase the volume of gas trading sales, natural gas transmission, oil transportation and improvements in other business segments.
The increase in volume from several business segments led to an increase in the Company’s revenue, which was also associated with optimal cost allocation, which eventually translated into the a positive bottom line.
INCOME STATEMENT Income The Company’s revenue comes from three business  segments, namely gas trading/transmission, oil and gas exploration and production, and other businesses which cover (1) gas processing, (2) oil transportation, (3) Network Services and (4) others in the form of: construction and operations and maintenance.
In 2023, the contribution of each business to business income was as given below: Throughout 2023, PGN delivered US3.64 billion in  revenue, up 2.2% compared to US 3.57 billion in 2022.
The increase in revenue was due to an increase in the revenues of the gas trading, gas transmission, oil transportation, regasification services and other business segments.
The increase in revenue of the Gas Trading business segment in 2023 was recorded at USD77.1 million or an increase of 3.1% compared to 2022.
Revenue of the gas trading business segment contributed 70.6% to consolidated revenue.
While there was a decline in oil & gas segment revenue due to a decrease in lifting volume and a decrease in average ICP, management was able to anticipate the decline by significantly increasing revenue from the oil transportation segment.
That points to the management’s success in implementing strategies to increase revenue generations. 185 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.
Cost of Revenue The realization of cost of revenue in 2023 reached USD2.91 billion, an increase of 4.5% or USD124.6 million, from USD2.79 billion reached in 2022.
The increase in cost of revenue was consistent with the increase in revenue.
The higher increase (by percentage) in cost of goods  than the increase in revenue was mainly because the decrease in cost of oil & gas was not commensurate with the decrease in revenue.
This was due to the depreciation, depletion and amortization components of oil & gas assets which do not necessarily decrease in value regardless of a decrease in lifting volume or a decrease in ICP.
Gross Profit PGN’s gross profit in 2023 fell 6% to USD733.6 million, compared to USD780.5 million in 2022.
The decrease was mainly due to the increase in cost of goods that was proportionally higher than the increase in revenue, especially due to the decrease in cost of oil & gas which was not commensurate with the decrease in revenue.
This was due to the depreciation, depletion and amortization components of oil & gas assets which do not necessarily decease in value regardless of a decrease in lifting volume or a decrease in ICP.
General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased by USD3 million or 1.5% to USD201.7 million in 2023, from USD198.7 million in 2022.
This increase was mainly due to an increase in General services expenses, and Repairs and maintenance expenses.
Other Income/(Expenses) - net In general, Other Income/(Expenses) - net was relatively stable in 2023 compared to 2022 with an increase of only USD0.3 million.
Operating Profit In 2023, PGN experienced a decrease of 8.4% in operating profit to USD542.4 million compared to USD592.2 million in 2022.
The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in gross profit.
The increase in financial income was due to management’s success in utilizing cash & cash equivalents managed under current accounts and deposits to optimize financial income.
Financial Expenses Financial expenses in 2023 decreased by 26.3% to USD97.6 million compared to USD132.4 million recorded in 2022.
The decrease in financial expense was mainly due to Liability Management which was implemented by buying back PGN and SAKA bonds.
Profit/(Loss) Exchange Difference In 2023, there was a net foreign exchange gain of USD7.4 million, an increase of 207.3% or USD14.3 million compared to a net foreign exchange loss of USD6.9 million incurred in 2022.
The increase in net exchange rate profit was mainly due to weaker JPY against the USD, giving rise to translation exchange gain on PGN’s long-term loans denominated in JPY.
Apart from that, there was a strengthening of the IDR exchange rate against the USD, giving rise to a translation exchange rate gain on IDR net assets.
Joint Venture Profit Share Profit share from the joint venture consists of the profit share of TGI, NR, PT Permata Karya Jasa, PT Perta-Samtan Gas, and PT Perta Daya Gas.
In 2023, there was a decrease of USD 16.2 million in the share of profits from associated entities and joint ventures to USD64.8 million from USD81.0 million in 2022.
The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in profits of Nusantara Regas, and PT Perta Samtan. 187 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.
Apart from that, PGN’s subsidiary, Pertagas, was still in the judicial review process regarding the 2017 VAT dispute that triggered the Company to allocate a provision of USD 2.3 million.
Thus, the tax dispute provision posted in 2023 was USD 29.9 million.
Profit/(Loss) Before Income Tax In 2023, PGN posted a profit before income tax of USD 523.9 million, a decrease of 3.5% or USD 18.8 million compared to USD 542.7 million recorded in 2022.
The decrease was due to a decrease in Operating Profit, provisions for tax disputes, and a decrease in profit contribution from joint ventures.
Income Tax Expense In 2023, net tax expenses increased by 4.2% to USD147.3 million compared to USD141.4 million in 2022.
Current taxes calculated in 2023 decreased by USD31.8 million to USD89.5 million compared to USD121.3 million in 2022.
This decrease was in line with the decrease in profit before tax.
The deferred tax expense increased to USD57.7 million, compared to USD20.0 million in the previous year.
This increase is due to the provisions for LNG contracts in 2023 being smaller than 2022, and the payment of Unutilized Gas Volume in 2023.
The following are details of income tax expenses based  on operational areas in various countries:URAIAN ATAS KINERJA KEUANGAN Description of Financial Performance Laporan Tahunan 2023 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk 188 04.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE DETAILS The Company’s capital structure takes into account the balance between the composition of loans bearing interest and equity.
Based on the 2023 Financial Statements, PGN’s capital structure is as follows: The composition of the Company’s interest bearing debt  consists of short-term loans, long-term loans to entities related to the Government, and bonds payable.
The Company’s total interest bearing debt composition in 2023 was USD 1.55 billion, a decrease of 28.1% compared to the interest bearing debt composition in 2022 due to the Company’s sound implementation of Liability Management.
The Company’s equity composition was USD3.54 billion,  consisting of paid-in share capital, retained earnings and other equity components.
In December 2003, the Company’s shares was first listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange with majority shares owned by the Republic of Indonesia, and has since 2018 been affiliated to PT Pertamina (Persero) in line with the initiative to establish an oil and gas holding.
In 2023, there were no corporate actions that would’ve  changed PGN’s equity structure.
MANAGEMENT POLICY ON CAPITAL  STRUCTURE PGN strives to maintain an optimal capital structure  in order to achieve business objectives, including by maintaining a healthy capital ratio and maximizing shareholder value.
Certain debt instruments of the Group have financial ratios that require a maximum leverage ratio.
PGN has complied with all capital requirements set by creditors.
Similarly, the management constantly monitors capital using a variety of financial leverage ratios, most notably the debt-to-equity and debt service ratios.
Furthermore, the Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors also review the conformity of the Company’s capital and debt structure with the Company’s strategic objectives and risk appetite.
BASIS OF MANAGEMENT POLICY FOR  CAPITAL STRUCTURE  PGN sets a capital structure policy by maintaining a debt  ratio in accordance with (not exceeding) the financial covenant in the PGN loan agreement with creditors at 67%:33%.

The realization of capital expenditure in 2023 is explained as follows: 1.
Types of Capital Expenditure  In 2023, PGN invested in capital goods in several sectors, namely Upstream, Midstream, Downstream, and Supporting/Related. 2.
Capital Expenditure Objectives  Investment in the Upstream sector is a development of the upstream oil and natural gas field, which is aimed at scaling up production in fields that are already operational.
Investment is also made in fields that are in the development and exploration stages to show the Company’s commitment to the Government in developing oil and natural gas fields.
Investment in the Midstream and Downstream sectors consisted of the construction of pipeline networks, supporting facilities for natural gas distribution, and the construction of LNG and Mini LNG.
The purpose is to achieve customer attachment, improve the reliability of network integrity, and increase the capacity of supporting facilities.
These are PGN’s efforts to provide excellent service to customers.
Investment in the Supporting/Related sector aims to support the main business of PGN, namely natural gas trading and transportation such as telecommunications, property & services, and construction & operation maintenance. 3.
Source of Funding  The fund for the investment outlay mentioned above was sourced from the Company’s internal fund plus with external loans.
Funding Facilities Owned by the Company  In 2023, the Company signed a term club deal facility agreement with PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk, PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, PT Bank BTPN Tbk, and PT Bank OCBC NISP Tbk with a total facility of USD800 Million consisting of Facility A USD600 Million (Committed) and Facility B USD200 Million (Uncommitted), after which a withdrawal of USD300 Million had been made on Facility A and used partly to fund the purchase of the Company’s bond. 5.

Implementation of the provision of LNG supply and infrastructure development, as well as the conversion of oil fuel use to LNG in the supply of electricity.
PGN has worked with other entities in the Pertamina Group to implement and support the implementation of generator gasification with pre-project activities since the beginning of the assignment of Ministerial Decree 13/2020, as an effort to accelerate the completion of programs that involved licensing activities, regional government/local stakeholder coordination, logistics scheme studies, site surveys, onshore & offshore primary data survey, preparation of technical documents & tenders, as well as discussion of land for the location of regasification facilities with PLN.
However, along the way, this program underwent changes due to a change in policy of the Minister of BUMN where it appointed PLN as the authorize party to run the program and assignments to Pertamina was revoked by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources on December 22 2023.
After the reporting period ended on December 31, 2023 until this Annual Report was published, there was material information that neither PLN nor its Subsidiaries and Affiliates need to disclose.
MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 2024 The global economy is predicted still face significant challenges in 2024.
Risks that will weaken the global economy in 2024 are predicted to start from geopolitical conflicts and tensions, as well as global inflation that will remain high, interest rates that are held at high levels, and the ongoing weakening of the Chinese economy, which affects the weakening of global trade, as well as shocks due to climate change.
In its January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF estimates that economic growth in 2024 will reach 3.1%.
Compared with the October 2023 WEO forecast, the forecast for 2024 is approximately 0.2 percentage points higher, reflecting improvements in China, the United States, as well as emerging markets and developing countries.
Moreover, the World Bank estimates that it will only grow by 2.4% in 2024, lower than growth in 2023, which stood at 2.6%.
Based on the 2024 RAPBN, the Indonesian Government  has set a target of 5.2% for Indonesia’s economic growth in 2024, higher than projected global economic growth.
Several institutions have projected Indonesia’s economic growth in 2024 include the World Bank, which projected 4.9%, the ADB and IMF, which projected 5.0%, and the OECD, which projected 5.2%.
In supporting Indonesia’s economic growth targets,  PGN as a Gas Subholding continues to improve the integration of natural gas infrastructure and strive to achieve increased natural gas trade management of around 954 BBTUD in 2024, or an increase of 3.4% compared to the realization in the previous year.
In terms of driving demand growth, the industrial sector is still the largest user, followed by the electricity sector.
The growth in gas use in the Industrial sector is driven by the smelter and refinery Industrial segment, which is in line with the Government’s program to encourage the construction of smelters and refinery development to increase the value of natural gas.
In addition, in carrying out its role as an agent of development in 2024, PGN will also continue the initiative to build household gas networks while reaching small-scale customers in their surrounding areas, which is an assignment from the Government.
G row and maintain gas business .
The achievement of these growth targets requires the availability of reliable supply, in which the existing gas supplies originating from conventional reserves currently tend to decrease due to natural decline.
However, in the future, with the discovery of new gas reserves and the expansion of existing domestic LNG production capacity, the fulfillment of domestic demand, which is projected to increase, will be met by LNG supply.
With the recently dynamic business landscape in which  the Company operated in 2023, there happened to be a gap between the Company’s achievements in 2023 and the long term target as stated under its 2021-2026 Long Term Plan (RJPP), including a gap in the volume of natural gas trade management, a gap in net profit caused by shortfalls in commercial volume targets and the implementation of Certain Natural Gas Prices (HGBT) which eroded the Company’s aggregate net profit, and delayed strategic projects than planned.
In addressing such conditions, PGN has prepared a  strategic business development program with the aim of continuing to grow the business in the midst of a challenging situation, taking the momentum of economic improvement, acceleration in the energy transition, as well as the need to develop derivative business/ product segments in the future that support the reduction in carbon emissions (low carbon business), which is outlined in 3 (three) pillars of business development, namely Grow, Adapt, and Step-out (GAS).
The GAS strategic program includes:1.
Grow and maintain gas business.
Program to increase the use of natural gas through the development of gas, CNG, and LNG infrastructure.
Some of the work programs that will be implemented include the provision of natural gas transmission, distribution, and regasification infrastructure to meet the needs of various customer segments (Industrial, Commercial, and Household), increasing the gas supply pipeline portfolio (and LNG as needed), and the provision of beyond pipeline (CNG & LNG) infrastructure, the optimization of upstream business by increasing production and exploration activities; and infrastructure development to support fuel distribution through pipelines and an increase in oil and gas lifting in synergy with Pertamina Group.
S tep-out and scale to new businesses .
Program to provide derivative business services that support performance improvement through product diversification and optimization of PGN’s existing portfolio.
Some of the work programs that will be implemented include: implementation of organic growth strategies and inorganic exploration in the provision of facilities for LNG Bunkering, LNG Trading, and Global Venture, development of the LNG Hub business, development of mini LNG liquefaction plant infrastructure; as well as total energy solutions in order to provide services and supporting services to customers. 3.
Step-out and scale to new businesses.
Program to prepare new businesses to support the downstream gas-based industry (petrochemical), clean and renewable energy (biomethane) business, and other Net Zero Emission supporting programs (such as Hydrogen/Ammonia and CO2 transport) by first developing competence, access to markets, and supply which is not currently owned by PGN through strategic partnerships with other business entities.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS PGN has prepared several strategic steps to address future challenges and business development efforts that span all energy potential in the gas sector, particularly in Indonesia.
The goal is for PGN to dominate not only the midstream sector, including natural gas infrastructure and distribution, but also the entire value chain, from upstream to downstream.
Arun LNG Hub The Arun LNG Terminal is located on a strategic trade route between LNG supplier and buyer destination countries and is close to developing LNG markets in Southeast Asia and South Asia.
Therefore, the Arun LNG Terminal aspires to become the LNG Hub leader in Asia in 2030. 203 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.
Currently, there are 5 LNG tanks in operation, which are intended for national regasification needs for the Sumatra region and the LNG Hub.
One of the initial stages to achieve the target as LNG Hub leader in Asia is to increase the number of LNG tanks by revitalizing the F-6004 tank, which has currently been in disuse status since 2004.
The revitalization process will commence in 2024 and is estimated to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.
Indonesia’s First LNG Bunkering PGN, as a Company engaged in the transmission and distribution of natural gas and as a Gas Subholding, continues to strive to strengthen its role in distributing good energy as a driver of economic growth in Indonesia by building Indonesia’s first LNG Bunkering.
One of the driving factors is that Indonesia’s territorial waters are a very strategic location for international shipping routes where the number of ships sailing through Indonesian waters reaches hundreds of thousands of ships in one year.
The Malacca Strait and Makassar Strait are one of  Indonesia’s busiest international shipping routes.
With the existing bunkering stations owned by Singapore and Malaysia, located around the Malacca Strait, which have long been operating, the potential for developing bunkering stations in the Makassar Strait area is more promising.
Adapun salah satu langkah percepatan dalam implementasi program tersebut adalah mengoptimalkan biofuel dengan mengekstensifkan penggunaan serta Since 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted the IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap regulation whereby ships on international shipping routes passing through the ECA (Emission Control Area) zones must not exceed the 0.1% sulfur content limit generated from the combustion; and ships entering the Global Cap zones must not exceed the sulfur content limit of 0.5% generated from the combustion.
Several alternative fuels can be used to obtain a sulfur content below 0.5%; for example, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
Several countries have operated LNG bunkering projects to meet LNG needs for ships using LNG fuel, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, China, the United States, Belgium, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and France.
Considering the adoption of IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap  regulation and the strategic location of Indonesian waters for international shipping routes, the potential for developing LNG bunkering in Indonesia is very promising.
Through the implementation of the LNG bunkering program, PNG gained benefits, namely the increase in revenue from gas (LNG) sales, improvement in the utilization of infrastructure owned by Pertamina Group (PT Badak NGL and PT Perta Arun Gas), as well as being a pioneer in creating the LNG market for domestic shipping sector.
Utilization of Biomethane from Palm Oil  Mill Effluent (POME) as an Effort to Reduce Carbon Emissions in Indonesia In an effort to reduce imports of fuel oil by 2030 and  to support carbon emission reduction, the Government has formulated several strategic steps outlined in the National Energy Grand Strategy (GSEN) document.
One of the accelerated steps in implementing the program is optimizing biofuels by intensifying the use and production of biofuels (biodiesel or bio-hydrocarbons including bioethanol).
The said biofuels cover optimization of the  205 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.

products from Palm Oil Mills (POM) and their derivative products that still have benefits for the environment.
The Palm oil industry is an important part of the national  economy with a transaction value of USD28.52 billion in 2021 or equivalent to 4.5% of Income Per Capita (GDP).
The potential for environmental pollution is related to the amount of waste and emissions generated from palm oil production activities, in which main products (Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Palm Kernel Oil (PKO)) only represent 26.3% of the total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) used as production raw materials.
A total of 44.5% of the FFB becomes biomass by-products, including Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), palm shells, mesocarp fiber, and palm kernel expeller.
Meanwhile, the highest productivity of byproducts is liquid waste (Palm Oil Mill Effluent/POME reaches 58% or equivalent to the amount of FFB), in which most of the POME is processed by the anaerobic fermentation method in open ponds that part of the products is to be used as fertilizer and the remaining product is not utilized/discarded.
As an effort to develop the Company’s business,  including optimizing PGN’s pipeline network and supporting the implementation process of GENS and the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Program, PGN recognizes the potential for providing clean energy such as Biomethane as alternative energy to drive economic growth in Indonesia.
Natural Gas Market Expansion In order to increase the value of natural gas utilization, PGN will expand its business into the natural gas utilization sector.
The opportunity being embarked on is the use of natural gas as a fuel source in smelters.
The Government’s policy to downstream mineral mining  products has aided the growth and development of the mineral processing and refining industry.
With other laws regulating emission levels in the downstream production process of minerals, the use of gas for the mining sector needs can increase gradually in the future.
The growth in demand for electric vehicle batteries also creates a niche for gas needs, particularly in the supply chain of the electric vehicle industry.
It can also create the potential for utilizing gas for processing and refining nickel as one of the chains.
The government’s plan to continue the construction of Phase II of the Cirebon-Semarang natural gas transmission pipeline presents opportunities in terms of increasing market access, strengthening supply reliability, and opening new business potential in the field of pipeline operations and maintenance.
With its expertise and experience in operating natural  gas infrastructure, PGN is ready to provide high-quality services to customers and support the government’s programs in improving the national energy mix and encouraging economic growth in Central and East Java.
PGN is also committed to contributing to creating jobs and improving the welfare of communities in the vicinity of the project area.
In addition, PGN also synergizes internally with Pertamina  Group in constructing infrastructure for the Senipah-Balikpapan pipeline to flow gas to the RU V Balikpapan refinery.
It has been in the commission stage in 2023, and in 2024 it will begin full operation to supply gas to RU V Balikpapan.
Gas Network Development To support the Government’s program to reduce LPG imports, PGN will expand the use of natural gas to the household segment with a target of adding 117 thousand new household connections in 2024.
This activity is part of the Gas Kita Pintar program.
In the future, apart from the development of gas networks independently, PGN plans to partner with business entities to develop this gas network.
Transportation of Crude Oil and Fuel Taking into account PGN’s experience and capability in the transportation business using the pipeline mode and the synergy of Pertamina Group, PGN supports Pertamina through the construction of the Rokan oil pipeline, with a total length of 360 km, which has been operating since November 2022 (first oil in).
In 2024, PGN is planning to build the Cikampek – Plumpang fuel pipeline, which is estimated to be completed in 2026. 207 2023 Annual Report PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk04.
