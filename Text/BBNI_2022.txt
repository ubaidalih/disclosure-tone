2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk240 241 2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance BNI for Stronger IndonesiaFinancial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceEconomy   and Industry Overview During 2022, the Indonesian economy grew rapidly  in line with the decline in restrictions of social and  business activities.
Economic growth in 2022  reaches 5.3% driven by the growth of household  consumption, investment, and also net exports,  which grew mainly due to rising commodity prices.
During the national economic recovery, Indonesia  was faced with a highly global inflation challenge,  which began due to the geopolitical crisis, and  this triggered an increase in the price of food and energy commodities.
Indonesia was also affected  by this global inflation increase, especially in  2022 when inflation rose to 5.5%.
Nonetheless,  this inflation was much better than the inflation  challenges faced by many other countries in the  world.
Bank Indonesia responded to rising inflation  and the depreciation of the Rupiah by increasing its interest rate to 5.5% in December 2022.
Gradually, an increase in interest rates also occurred  in the banking industry in response to the increase  in interest rate policies.
Rising interest rates were  seen as still helpful to support economic recovery.
This was due tp the increase being relatively limited,  supported by adequate liquidity.
The growth in Third Party Funds (DPK) was  recorded at 9.0% yoy, with loans at 11.4% yoy (as  of December 2022).
Broadly speaking, the banking  industry was quite stable with an adequate capital  adequacy ratio (25.4% as of December 2022) and  a good non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 2.6%  (December 2022).
ECONOMIC OvERvIEw The national economic performance strengthened  in 2022, with the growth reaching 5.3%, far higher  than 3.7% in 2021.
Strengthening investment and exports as well as a continuation of the  recovery in public consumption will be the main  support of growth.
The contribution of household  consumption to aggregate GDP growth returned  to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.
This was due to  a recovery in economic activity throughout 2022  after the increaed public immunity due to the  comprehensive vaccination program.
The economic  activity recovery increased the income of workers  and entrepreneurs, thus restoring purchasing power  that had fallen due to the pandemic the previous year.
Consumption growth in 2022 reached 5%, a large increase compared to 2.1% in 2021.
For the household consumption  component, the fastest growth was in transportation and the communication expenditure category (9.4%) and food  expenditure in restaurants (6.6%).
The rapid growth in these two categories of household spending confirmed that  strong consumption growth was supported by a return of activities in sectors that were closed/limited operations during the pandemic.
Other than consumption, investments also grew positively by 4.9% and contributed to approximately 1/4 of aggregate  economic growth; the same was true of net export performance that also contributed 1/4 of total economic growth  and increases by 30.9% in 2022.
The growth in net export performance was supported by rising prices in Indonesia’s main export commodities on  the global market.
During 2022, Indonesia’s export goods average price increased by 24.3% YoY, while the import goods average price only increased 18.3% YoY.
In terms of volume during 2022, total exports only increased by 4%  YoY, while total imports increased 2.8% YoY.
In total value, the sharp increase in average export prices compensated  for the minimal increase in terms of volume, resulting in a significant growth in the trade balance of 53.9% YoY.

The higher global inflation was caused by a number of factors,  namely (1) the simultaneous ongoing recovery momentum in global demand, (2) this recovery was not  accompanied by the same speed of recovery in the global supply chain that was disrupted during the  pandemic, and (3) the conflict between Ukraine and Russia causing additional pressure on global food and  energy supplies.
In March 2022, the prices of food and energy commodities experienced a sharp spike,  which impacted the whole world including Indonesia.
Although in terms of trade, Indonesia experienced  a positive impact from rising commodity prices as shown above, while another impact from geopolitical  tensions also spread to consumer inflation.
As a result of rising fuel prices on the global market, the Indonesian Government raised the price of fuel  oil (BBM) in the QIII 2022, which resulted in increased inflation in Indonesian.
Since September 2022,  Indonesia’s inflation was above 5%, and closed at 5.5% at the end of the year.
Even though Indonesia’s  general inflation has jumped quite a lot compared to the pre-pandemic average for the last 5 years (2015- 2019: 3.9%), this inflation achievement is far better than the phenomenon of global inflation, which has  increased by 8.9%*) in 2022.
For the record, this increase in global inflation was far above the 2015-2019 world inflation average, which was 2%.
Throughout 2022, the central banks of the majority of countries in the world also increased their reference  rate.
This was in response to rising inflation during a period of economic recovery and as a result of  geopolitical events.
The increase in the benchmark interest rate was driven by the United States (US)  central bank, The Federal Reserve (The Fed), where during 2022 the Fed raised the Federal Funds Rate  (FFR) benchmark rate by 425bps.
As a result of the sharp increase in interest rates in the US, many global  funds have moved to the US market, so that the US dollar strengthened against many other currencies  in the world.
Against the US dollar, the Rupiah depreciated by 9.2% during 2022.
This depreciation is  deeper than the average historical data for the previous five years, which was 1.5%.
When compared  to other developing countries, the depreciation of the Rupiah in 2022 was more than that of Vietnam  (3.5%), Thailand (3.6%), Malaysia (5.7%), China (8.9%); but lower than the Philippines (9.3%), India (11.3%),  and Turkey (40.6%).
Description: *) Figures are based on provisional estimates, official figures have not been released at the time of writingBank Indonesia, as the monetary authority in Indonesia, also responded to rising inflation and the depreciation  of the Rupiah by making adjustments to its benchmark interest rate.
During 2022, Bank Indonesia raised interest  rates 5 times with a total increase of 200 bps, so that at the end of 2022 the benchmark interest rate was 5.5%.
Nominally, Indonesia’s interest rate is on par with the Philippines (5.5%), above Thailand (1.3%), Singapore (2.7%) and  Malaysia (2.8%), but below Vietnam (6%) and India (6.3%).
When compared to the inflation rate in these countries,  Indonesia’s real interest rate entered positive territory along with several other developing countries, including India,  Vietnam, China, Mexico, and Brazil.
Positive real interest rates should be an attractive signal for global placement of funds in Indonesia, which started in late 2022.
From the fiscal side, state revenue in 2022 increased rapidly by 30.6% YoY to Rp2,626 trillion, while state spending  increased 10.9% to Rp3,091 trillion, which caused a deficit of Rp464.3 trillion.
The Government succeeded in  carrying out its mandate in Perppu No. 1 of 2020, which allowed the pandemic deficit to cross the threshold of 3% of GDP for 3 years, but must return to below 3% in 2023.
The 2022 budget deficit was recorded at 2.4% of GDP, an achievement for the Government and state finance performance that is expected to be appreciated by the market and rating agencies.

The economic recovery in 2022 encouraged increased  performance in the banking sector, supported by  increasingly positive corporate performance.
Bank loan growth in December 2022 grew 11.4% (yoy),  higher than the previous year’s growth of 5.2% (yoy).
The loan in credit growth occurred evenly accross  all economic sectors and all types of loan, especially  for Investment Loans and Working Capital Loans.
The positive development in the Bank’s lending was  influenced by improvements in demand and supply.
On  the supply side, the increase was supported by a banking  liquidity that remained loose, and on the demand side,  the increase in loans/financing was supported by steady  corporate demand and household consumption.
Sectoral lending grew positively in all business areas,  except for the Electricity, Gas and Water sector that was  still negative by the end of 2022.
There was an increasing  trend in credit risk that needed to be watched, especially  in the fisheries sector, Accommodation & Food and  Beverage Provision, Wholesale and Retail Trade, Industry  Processing, as well as in Construction.
Banking liquidity was maintained, supported by strong  growth in Third Party Funds (TPF) throughout 2022.
TPF  growth in December 2022 was 9.0% (yoy), indicating  high public interest in saving their funds in banks.
Banking interest rates are still conducive to supporting  economic recovery, although they have gradually  increased in response to the increase in the Central  Bank’s benchmark interest rate (BI7DRR).
The increase  in banking interest rates, which began to be limited, was  due to loose liquidity.
Banking capital remains strong with the December 2022  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) remaining high at 25.4%.
Along with strong capital, credit risk is still under control,  reflected in the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio in  December 2022 of 2.6%. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk246 247 2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance BNI for Stronger IndonesiaFinancial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceBNI Strategic     Policy for 2022 BNI CORPORATE PLAN 2021-2025 BNI has compiled the strategy direction until 2025  in response to external conditions that changed  quite dynamically in recent years following the  COVID-19 Pandemic, and fundamental changes  in the banking industry landscape.

BNI is also working on the potential for increasing  transactions from priority customers, potential  derivative businesses for existing customers, increasing  the level of integration of BNI digital products with  existing partner solutions, meeting the needs of customized customer Application Programming  Interface (API) services, synergizing with subsidiary  companies to provide business solutions that are  optimal for customers, as well as increasing cross- selling and up-selling to customers.
Efforts to keep  corporate customer transactions sustainable are also  being carried out by increasing monitoring of system  reliability to make it more effective and efficient as  well as to provide superior after sales service, focused  on excellence customer experience.
The factors considered to support BNI’s loan  expansion in the Energy-based sector (Mining,  Energy & Renewable Energy, Oil & Gas,  Petrochemical) and Agribusiness include: 1.
Growth of the mining sector driven by an increase  in demand for coal commodities, caused by the  Russia & Ukraine conflict that has resulted in an  energy crisis and China’s economic recovery,  as one of the largest coal importing countries  in the world.
Another factor is the existence of  Government support to carry out a downstream  program for mineral mining products (copper,  gold, nickel, bauxite) and regulations prohibiting  the export of mineral ores so as to provide added  value for export products and generate foreign  exchange.
The increase in demand for copper  and nickel is projected to increase along with  the need for raw materials for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EV).
The demand for gold  has fairly good stability as it is the prima donna  of the world’s investment instruments. 2.
Specifically in renewable energy, this will provide  a positive color for BNI during the trend of  Government support for environmentally friendly  businesses, as regulated in the Presidential Regulation on New and Renewable Energy  (EBT) 2022. 3.
The Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries are  the backbone of the national economy.
The large  scope of this industry is a clear illustration for  capturing existing business potentials. 4.
In the agribusiness sector, the Government’s  policy to reopen the palm oil export faucet  will encourage the upstream to downstream  industrial sector to meet world demand for  palm oil.
The manufacturing sector (including FMCG) still has  the potential to grow with the following positive  sentiments:1.
The central government has instructs all  ministries/agencies to use domestic products,  so as to create a multiplier effect from upstream  to downstream in the manufacturing sector. 2.
Improvements in consumption levels supported  by increases in average minimum wages and  reductions in production costs with easy accessibility to travel or toll roads that have  been connected throughout Java Island and  parts of Sumatra.
Pharmacies is a promising sector and is part of the  priority sectors for realizing the Making Indonesia  4.0 program.
The Indonesian Government is trying  to increase the competitiveness of the medical  device and pharmaceutical sector by encouraging  the technology-based digital transformation, as well  as the Government’s focus on developing the health industry in an effort to overcome a dependence  on imported raw materials.
There was a trend of lifestyle changes caused by  the dynamic technological developments that had  a good impact on the telecommunication sector  and the digital economy where digital connectivity  and services have become basic needs during  the pandemic until now.
The shift in people’s behavior towards a less-contact economy due  to the COVID-19 pandemic has driven growth in  the digital economy in Indonesia, which currently  includes e-commerce, ride hailing, online media,  and online travel.
Finally, the transportation sector currently has  the highest growth compared to other sectors, in  line with the revocation of the PPKM policy by the  Government at the end of December 2022.1.

Digital Account In January 2021 BNI launched the newest feature  for opening savings accounts through the BNI  Mobile Banking digital channel, namely “Open Savings Simply with a Selfie” where previously  customers when opening digital savings still  needed video calls with a bank officer or had  to visit the nearest BNI branch office.
It is  hoped that with this new feature, the customer  experience will improve and the myth of  difficulties when opening a bank account can  be answered through BNI’s breakthrough.
The  products that can be opened include Taplus,  Taplus Bisnis and Taplus Muda.
In addition, BNI is  the first bank to launch a savings account feature  with just a selfie where an account is created  immediately and can be used immediately for  transactions.
Of course, this service was welcomed very  positively by the community during a pandemic,  where people’s mobility was limited and visits  to branch offices were not their main choice.
Even after the end of social restrictions and  the infection rate having dropped dramatically,  people still prefer the digital account opening  method.
This shows that the “Open Savings  Simply with a Selfie” feature is very popular  with the public because of its ability to provide  convenience to customers in opening a savings  account anywhere and anytime.
During 2022 opening savings through the “Open Savings Simply with a Selfie” feature  saw a growth of 147.4% from the previous year.
In total, more than 1 million savings accounts  have been opened through all of BNI’s digital  channels in 2022.
In the future, opening digital  savings accounts will be encouraged by various  developments aimed at facilitating the user experience for potential customers, such as  updating the user interface, to be simpler and  easier, the availability of potential customer  validation options such as through video calls,  feature adjustments, and more competitive  savings product costs.
In addition, there will be  additional Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  services, which will make it easier for prospective  customers to complete the supporting data for  opening a savings account.
The BNI Fortune Lottery Program #GaPakeNanti  is a lottery program for individual BNI savings  customers with an automatic conversion  mechanism and the exchange of BNI POIN+ to  raffle coupons.
For 2022, the program period  ran from September 12, 2022 to April 30, 2023. 2022 event campaigns were held in two cities, on  October 14-16, 2022 at Summarecon Mall Bekasi  and on December 8-11, 2022 at the Cirebon Super  Block Mall.
Furthermore, various promotional programs for  opening BNI digital savings will continue in 2023,  such as BNI POIN+ bonuses, which will be larger  when opening savings through channel outlets,  shopping vouchers at leading e-commerce, with  various e-wallet balance bonuses and additional  initial deposit cashback.
For developing market potential, BNI is also  expanding into new market segments that have  not been optimally exploited before.
One of  these markets is with the communities with high  engagement, such as eSports and Metaverse  communities.
In 2022, BNI conducted a series  of events in collaboration with the communities,  such as the BNI - Telkomsel Tournament eSports  2022 event, where BNI acquired savings for game  enthusiasts through a digital savings opening  service.
Looking forward, BNI will focus more on  acquisition activities for other communities, so  that the potential for customers to make closed  loop transactions can be even higher.
Apart from collaborating with leading partners  in recommending opening savings accounts, BNI  will also continue with its referral program that is  used by BNI employees and BNI customers where  for each referral given there will be attractive  rewards.
It is hoped that these activities will  encourage the opening of savings accounts  through digital channels using an easier, faster  digital capability development process as well as a variety of attractive promotional program offers.
Digital Account Opening has also been  developed through BNI’s support for the Pre- Employment Card Program by making it easy  for Pre-Employment Card participants to open  accounts digitally through the Pre-Employment  E-form.
This service can be accessed via the  Pre-Employment website or smartphone of each  Pre-Employment Card participant.
This account  can be directly used by recipients of the Pre- Employment Card Program incentives as well as  used for various banking transactions as it has  been directly integrated with BNI Mobile Banking  facilities.
BNI also provides direct benefits to  Pre-Employment card customers, through life  insurance facilities and attractive programs  such as motorcycle prize draws, smartphones, e-vouchers, etc.
During the process of opening this digital account,  apart from customers being able to choose a regular  type of debit card for the Taplus, Taplus Bisnis and  Taplus Muda savings products, they can also directly  choose the BNI Batik Air debit card, so that customers  can immediately enjoy special benefits attached to  BNI debit card holders, which has a unique present  value (UPV) for customers who own BNI Batik Air  debit cards.

The strategies undertaken to support the expansion  of Subsidized Griya in 2022 were as follows:i)  Accelerating BNI Griya FLPP bookings for  additional BNI Griya FLPP quota commitments  from the Government.

For example, BNI digital channel transactions  for consumer and corporations have increased  successively from 2020 to 2022.
Of course, this  shows that there has been a change in consumer  behavior in the financial industry, including in BNI.
Due to these changes and challenges, BNI develops  digital banking on an ongoing basis through quality  digital products, and is able to provide added value  for customers from BNI business segments.
The  increasing use of BNI’s digital banking products has  seen an increase in BNI’s sustainable income and  third party funds.
In addition, digitizing business  processes to simplify business processes and  opening up new business potentials will increase  efficiency at BNI.
BNI’s development of digital services was also  carried out to respond to regulatory policies in  the Bank Indonesia vision of the Indonesia 2025  payment system, which encourages banks to  transform to a digital end to end, especially through  development of open banking, data openness,  Retail payment system improvement, as well as  interlinks between banks and digital financial  services.
To support customer convenience in carrying out  banking transaction activities, BNI has flagship  products called BNI Mobile Banking for retail  customers and BNIDirect for corporate customers.
Both of these flagship products have won national  and international awards.

ATM Performance 2022  2021Increase (Decrease) NominalPercentage (%) Total Transactions (million) 1.374,1 1.532,5 (158,4) (10,3) Transaction Volume (Rp-million) 675.848,8 734.447 ,3 (58.598,5) (7 ,8) ATM transactions are predominately interbank transfer transactions, cash withdrawals and bill payments.
The decline in the number and volume of ATM transaction values in 2022 was due to changes in customer behavior  as they shifted ATM transactions to digital transactions.
At BNI, this decline was seen in the increase in BNI  Mobile Banking transactions.
Currently, the development of ATM channel focuses on the development of joint partnerships with third parties  such as e-commerce partners and BPDs in Indonesia that provide cash withdrawal banking services without  cards, and other services.
The ATM channel development is also focused on the CRM (Cash Recycle Machine)  channel development, where customers can make cash withdrawal deposit transactions without the need to  go to the branch.
In the long run, the use of CRM channels makes it easy for customers to transition from cash  transactions to digital, so as to create cashless society supported by the BNI digital banking products.  2.

Inflation is  expected to decline to 3.8 after the impact of the  fuel price hike on consumer inflation comes down.
Pressure on the Rupiah exchange rate is expected  to occur early in the first half of 2023 due to an  increase in the benchmark interest rate in the United  States, but it should ease in the second half of the  year underpinned by Indonesia’s strong economic  fundamentals in terms of controlled inflation and  good economic growth, which have attracted  capital flows into the country.
To anticipate Rupiah volatility and the ongoing  monetary tightening policy in the US in the first  half of 2023, it is estimated that Bank Indonesia’s  benchmark interest rate will still have a chance to  increase to the level of 5.75 and remain at that level  throughout 2023.
From the perspective of the banking industry, the  stability of the domestic economy is the catalyst  for healthy business growth.
Bank loan growth in  2023 is estimated to be in the range of 7-9, and  TPF growth at the level of 7.2-8.5.
MARKETING STRATEGY In the current digital era, BNI is committed to  becoming an agile bank dealing with rapidly changing market wants and needs as well as  increasingly fierce business competition.
For this  reason, BNI always improves banking services in  a sustainable manner in line with the RACE (Risk Culture, Agile, Collaboration, Execution Oriented)  values.
To communicate these products and services, a marketing communication strategy is needed that is integrated corporately with  corporate messages about BNI’s products.
These  messages start from BNI’s commitment to become  a state-owned bank with global capabilities, to  BNI’s commitment to become a digital-based bank.
As a national bank with competitive advantages  in international business, BNI has aspirations to  contribute significantly to Indonesia’s economic Marketing     Aspect growth and bridge Indonesian business in the global  arena through the presence of 7 overseas branch  offices (KCLN) in New York, London, Tokyo, Osaka,  Seoul, Singapore, and Hong Kong.
In May 2022, BNI  expanded its network to the European continent  by opening a representative office in the city of  Amsterdam, in an effort to optimize international  banking performance.
BNI’s presence overseas  can also be seen as a door for investors, Diaspora  and potential customers to get to know Indonesia  more through BNI’s products and services.
This  idea is the basis of BNI’s corporate message and  is emphasized in 2022 with the theme “BNI for  Stronger Indonesia” at the 76th anniversary.
Furthermore, this theme is also a form of a  commitment that is in line with the G20 presidency  theme for 2022, namely “Recover Together, Recover  Stronger”.
BNI is determined to invite Indonesia  and the world to work together and support each  other in post-pandemic economic recovery to grow  stronger.
This spirit of optimism is visualized in a  video manifesto that describes BNI’s journey as  a bank that is present with a variety of financial  products and services for Indonesia and the world.
In making this video, BNI collaborated with Alffy  Rev, who is a young Indonesian multitalented artist  with a high sense of nationalism that he pours  into each of his works.
The video went viral online  through BNI’s official social media account, and  has been watched by 181 thousand viewers and  generated 32 thousand likes.
On the Instagram  account @alffy_rev, the video was watched by 373  thousand viewers and received 41 thousand likes.
Another step taken in communicating BNI’s  message as a bank with global capabilities is to  consistently participate in international scale events.
One way was through the BNI Indonesian Masters,  the largest golf tournament event in Indonesia with  number of world-renowned golf athletes and is  broadcast on television channels worldwide.
Based on the spirit of optimism to build a stronger  and more sustainable business ecosystem, BNI also  appointed 3 product champions.
Starting from  MSMEs and Indonesian Diaspora with Xpora, retail  customers with BNI Mobile Banking, to corporate  customers with BNIDirect, to provide convenience  and comfort for transactions anywhere and anytime  for all its customers.

In 2022, features were updated in BNIDirect by adding  the Online Account Opening feature, which makes it  easier for customers to open current accounts digitally;  BNI Giro Multi Currency, which allows customers to  make payment settlements in different currencies with  just one account.
As a form of BNI’s commitment to  Global Transaction Banking, BNI launched BNIDirect  in Overseas Branch Offices (KCLN) to accommodate  the needs of digital banking transactional services for  diaspora customers who wish to develop their business.
In 2023, BNI will continue to innovate by providing  features and services that prioritize customer business  convenience by adding Single Sign On features, Financial  Dashboard, Online Onboarding, Chatbot, and presenting  the BNIDirect Lite Version application.
In 2022, BNI consistently marketed Xpora to the public  directly through a series of events held at home and  abroad.
One being the iconic handicraft exhibition  event, INACRAFT, in March and October.
Then from  June to July, BNI invited MSMEs to join the Xpora Fest  2022 program where MSMEs had the opportunity to  do business matching and product showcasing to  expand their market at international events.
Then in the  framework of the BBI Proud Indonesian Made National  Movement (Gernas BBI) campaign in September 2022,  BNI collaborated with the Ministry of SOEs (KBUMN) to  help West Kalimantan MSMEs go digital and go global.
With the campaign theme #Corak-CorakKalBar, Xpora  was the product highlighted by BNI during the campaign.
Not only MSMEs, but Xpora also helps Indonesian  Diaspora throughout the world to expand marketing  opportunities for Indonesian MSME products abroad.
Through the Tong Tong Fair event held in The Hague,  Netherlands, Xpora offered integrated business solutions  and assistance programs for MSMEs to go productive,  go digital and go global.
The consistency of Xpora’s  communication strategy also resulted in success with  awards won from the 2022 BUMN Branding & Marketing  Award, namely in the Branding Strategy, Digital Branding,  Technology Enhancement, Global Brand and Marketing  Strategy, and International Recognition categories.
In the consumer segment, BNI continues to optimize  services and responds to customer requests through  BNI Mobile Banking.
Equipped with features for daily  transactions such as education payments, electricity,  telco, e-wallet top ups, smart remittances to purchasing  streaming and games vouchers, BNI Mobile Banking  is a user friendly banking application.

BNI  LDR in 2022 was 84.2%, an increase of 4.5% due to  lending increasing (10.5% YoY) compared to Third  Party Funds (TPF) that only grew 4.6% YoY, mainly due to tighter market liquidity. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk378 379 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformance•	Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) BNI’s Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio in 2022 increased to 83.4% compared to 74.1% in 2021.
The RIM ratio level was still below the regulatory requirements of 84%-94%.
However, there was a  relaxations not subject to disincentives if the RIM is outside the specified range.
Compliance Ratio •	Statutory Reserves (GWM) BNI consistently maintained an optimal level of liquidity adequacy to support its daily operations and  comply with Bank Indonesia regulations through the Minimum Statutory Reserves (GWM).
In 2022, BNI’s Rupiah GWM position is 11.9% and Foreign Currency GWM was 4.0%, an increase compared to the previous year’s Rupiah GWM of 7.7% and 4.0% respectively, as a result of the interest rates policy by Bank Indonesia until the end of 2022.
BNI’s Minimum Statutory Reserves (GWM) were in accordance with Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI)  No. 24/4/PBI/2022 dated March 1, 2022 concerning Statutory Reserves for Commercial Banks in Rupiah  and Foreign Currency for Conventional Commercial Banks, and the Board of Governors Members  Regulation (PADG) No. 24/8/PADG/2022 dated June 30, 2022 (2021: the Bank’s Minimum Statutory  Reserves (GWM) was in accordance with Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) No. 20/3/PBI/2018 dated  March 29, 2018 concerning Minimum Statutory Reserves for Commercial Banks in Rupiah and Foreign  Currency for Conventional Commercial Banks, and the Board of Governors Members Regulation  (PADG) No. 22/19/PADG/2020 dated July 29, 2020).
•	Net Open PositionBNI’s Net Open Position (NOP) for the period ending December 31, 2022 was 1.6%, higher than the  previous year’s position of 0.9%.
However, this figure is still far below the maximum amount set by  BI in PBI No. 5/13/PBI/2003 concerning the Net Open Position of Commercial Banks, as amended  several times, most recently by PBI No. 17/5/PBI/2015, which is 20% of the capital.

Commitment receivables increased by 32.8% in 2022 to reach Rp23.6 trillion, most of which was for  Purchase of Foreign Currency Futures Not Resolved.
The total commitment liabilities in 2022 increased by  21.9% compared to 2021, largely influenced by the increase in the position of Spot Sales and Derivatives  that were still running in 2021, of 35.8%.
Contingent receivables in 2022 increased by 11.9% compared  to 2021, and was dominated by an increase in Bank Guarantees Received by 15.6% and Others by 15.8%.
Contingent liabilities increased by 10.4% in 2022 compared to 2021, and was affected by the increase  in Bid Bonds.
Overall, fluctuations in the movement of commitments and contingencies were in line  with loan growth, considering that debtors were increasingly optimizing the use of BNI’s products and  services with competitive features.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING FACILITIES BNI conducts derivative transactions for the Bank’s and the customer’s interests.
As of December 31,  2022, there was an increase in derivative transactions compared to the previous year.
The increase in  transactions was in line with the needs of the Bank and the needs of customers to conduct transactions,  or also hedge when managing market risk.
The increase in derivative transactions was dominated by  foreign currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
In conducting its business, BNI conducts derivative financial instrument transactions such as foreign  currency futures contracts, foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and option  transactions to manage exposure to market risks such as currency risk and interest rate risk.
Derivative  financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Any  increase in the fair value of a derivative contract is recorded as an asset when the fair value is positive  and as a liability when the fair value is negative.
Derivative receivables and payables are classified as  financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Receivables or losses resulting from  changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on discounted cash flows and brokers’  quoted price models or other instruments with similar characteristics.
In addition, in conducting business, BNI carries out derivative financial instruments transactions such  as foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for the purpose of customer funding, trading and hedging transaction needs.

The Bank  Health Level Assessment is carried out using a Risk- based Bank Rating approach both individually as  well as on a consolidated basis.
The Bank’s health  level is a means to identify at an early stage the  bank’s problems, determine the future business  strategy, formulate and implement corrective action  over the Bank’s weakness/problem, provide the  basis for the process of linking capital with risk, as  a basis for decision-making as well as to enhance competitiveness.
For the supervisory authority, it is a tool for  determining the strategy and focus of supervision  of the Bank.
The Bank’s Health Level Assessment is based on  4 (four) factors as follows:1.
Risk Profile Risk Profile assessment is conducted by evaluating the risks inherent in the Bank’s  activities and the quality of risk management  implementation on the 8 types of risk. 2.
Good Corporate Governance Good Corporate Governance assessment  evaluates the quality of the Bank’s management  in the application of Good Corporate Governance  principles. 3.
Earnings Assessment of the Earnings factor covers the evaluation of profitability performance,  profitability sources, profitability sustainability, and profitability management. 4.
Capital  Assessment of Capital covers the evaluation  of capital adequacy and adequacy of capital  structure management.
At BNI, evaluation of  capital adequacy is related to the Bank’s Risk  Profile.
Assessment of Bank Health Level is reported to the  regulator (OJK) every 6 months (semi-annually)  in June and December.
Bank BNI’s Health Level  assessment results for December 31, 2021 ranked “Healthy” meaning that:1.
The condition of the Bank is generally healthy, so it is considered capable of facing significant  negative effects from changes in business  conditions and other external factors. 2.
The ratings for the assessment factors (Risk  Profile, Governance, Profitability, and Capital) are  generally good.
If there are any weaknesses, then  in general these weaknesses are less significant.
PLEDGED ASSETS In the period ending December 31, 2022, there were  no pledged assets at BNI.
IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE  CHANGES ON BANK PERFORMANCE BI’s benchmark 7-day (Reverse) Repo Rate (7DRR)  interest rate increased by 2.25% in 2022 to 5.75%,  and the Financing to Funding Ratio (FFR) increased  by 4.25% to 4.50%.
The increase in BI7DRR had an impact on increasing  BNI’s interest income which was felt in the Q3 2022,  as reflected in BNI’s loan yield (Bank Only) on a  Year to Date (YtD) basis that increased from 7.36%  as of June 2022 to 7.41% as of September 2022,  and 7.50% as of December 2022.
The increase in  loan yield was driven by BNI’s credit reference and  manage rate with a total composition of 82% of  BNI’s total loans.
BNI’s Earning Assets, other than loans, also  experienced interest rate adjustments, in line  with changes in market interest rates.
This was  reflected in the marketable securities yield that  increased by 3bps from 4.35% as of December 2021  to 4.38% as of December 2022, and placements  yields that increased from 0.75% as of December 2021 to 2.17% as of December 2022.
Overall, BNI’s  yield on earning assets increased by 38bps YoY  from 6.10% as of December 2021 to 6.48% as of  December 2022.
On the liabilities side, the increase in the benchmark  interest rate was followed by a change in the Rupiah  Minimum Reserve Requirement (GWM) to 9.00% in  September 2022, thereby putting pressure on the Cost of Fund (CoF) side.
However, BNI had made  interest cost efficiencies in QI 2022 as reflected  in the reduction in BNI’s TPF CoF from 1.60% as  of December 2021 to 1.42% as of June 2022, so  that the increase in the benchmark interest rate  starting in QIII could be managed by BNI properly,  as reflected in BNI’s TPF CoF that was maintained  at the level of 1.51% as of December 2022, or an  increase of 9bps.
The Cost of Interest Bearing Non-TPF Liabilities also  increased following the market interest rates movement  with increases ranging from 6bps YoY for Marketable  Securities Issued, and 213bps YoY for Borrowings & Repo.
Overall, the Cost of Interest Bearing Liabilities increased  by 23bps YoY from 1.65% as of December 2021 to 1.88%  as of December 2022.
As explained above, the impact of rising interest rates  on asset and liability portfolios shows that the asset  portfolio composition, especially the BNI loan portfolio  and the efficiency of the Cost of Fund (CoF) DPK at  the beginning of the year had a positive impact on  improving BNI’s Net Interest Margin (NIM).
It should be  noted that BNI’s NIM increased 11bps YoY from 4.70%  as of December 2021 to 4.81% as of December 2022.
PRIME LENDING RATE  Based on OJK Regulation No. 37/POJK.03/2019  concerning Transparency and Publication of Bank Reports and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 7/6/ PBI/2005 concerning Transparency of Bank Product  Information and Use of Customer Personal Data (State  Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia 2005 Number  16, Supplement to the State Gazette of the Republic  of Indonesia No. 4475), Commercial Banks who carry  out conventional business activities in Indonesia are required to report and publish the Prime Lending Rate (SBDK) in Rupiah.
The prime lending rate implementation aims to provide  clarity to customers and facilitate customers in weighing  the benefits, costs and loan risks offered by the Bank.
In addition, publication of prime lending rates are  intended to improve good governance and promote  healthy competition in the banking industry, among  others, through the creation of better market disciplines.
In addition, the prime lending rate is used as an indicator  of the amount of loan interest rates that will be charged  to customers applying for Bank loans.
Therefore, BNI  updates the prime lending rate in accordance with the movement of the reference interest rate set by  Bank Indonesia.
In general, the prime lending rate is  calculated based on 3 (three) components, namely the Cost of Funds for Loans (HPDK) arising from customer  fundraising activities, operating expenses incurred for  fundraising and lending and the profit margin component  set by the Bank in its lending activities.
The prime  lending rate calculation does not take into account the risk premium component of the debtor, the amount of which depends on the risk assessment of each debtor.
Thus, the loan interest rate charged to debtors is not  necessarily the same as the prime lending rate.
BNI is required to report the prime lending rate calculation to Bank Indonesia on a monthly basis and periodically  publish in the wider media.
The prime lending rate calculation applies to types of corporate loans, retail loans, micro  loans, and consumption loans (KPR and non- KPR).
However, Bank Indonesia submits the classification of corporate  loans, retail loans and consumer loans (KPR and non-KPR) based on the internal criteria used by each bank.
The following shows the prime lending rate determined by BNI in 2022: Prime Lending Rate Per Year Based On Business Segments Corporation  Loans (%)Retail Loans  (%)Micro Loans  (%)Consumption Credit KPR (%)Non KPR (%) Prime Lending Rate 8.00 8.25 N/A 7 .25 8.75 FEE BASED INCOME ACCELERATION GROWTH 2022 (Rp-billion)2021 (Rp-billion)2020 (Rp-billion)Increase (Decrease)  2021-2022Increase (Decrease 2020-2021 Nominal (Rp- billion)Percentage   (%)Nominal (Rp- billion)Percentage   (%) Recurring Fee 13,629 12,620 11,304 1,009 8.0 1,316 11.6 Non Recurring Fee 1,191 1,019 560 172 16.9 459 82.0 Total 14,820 13,639 11,864 1,181 8.7 1,775 15.0 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk386 387 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceBNI’s Fee Based Income in 2022 amounted to Rp14.8 trillion (Consolidated), an increase of 8.7% from  Rp13.6 trillion in 2021.
This increase was dominated by 3 (three) banking activities including Syndication,  Bank Guarantee Under Counter (BGUC), and Share Investments.
A significant increase occurred in  Syndications that grew in 2022 by 100.8%, and was dominated by an increase in the Management Fees  for syndicated loans.
An increase also occurred in the Bank Guarantee Under Counter (BGUC) of 67.7%.
In  addition, Shares Investments also increased by 53.9%, and was dominated by BNI’s profit portion from BSI.
ABILITY TO PAY DEBT BNI maintained good liquidity and solvency levels for the period until December 31, 2022.
This was reflected  in BNI’s ability to fulfill all maturing obligations in a timely manner, both for principal debt or interest  expense payments.
The banking financial ratios to measure BNI’s liquidity and solvency are as follows:  1.
Bank Liquidity: Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt BNI’s ability to meet its short-term obligations is achieved through good liquidity management.
To  increase short-term liquidity resilience, BNI maintains adequate liquidity by managing several indicators,  including the Primary Reserve (Minimum Demand Deposit and Cash), Secondary Reserve (Liquidity Reserve), and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) in accordance with regulatory requirements.
LCR is a comparison ratio between High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and estimated total net cash outflow for the next 30 (thirty) days in a crisis scenario.
In December 2022 BNI’s LCR reached 219.0% (bank  only) and 223.44% (consolidated), above the regulatory provisions, which stipulate that the lowest LCR  fulfillment is 85% until January 31, 2023 or during the banking relaxation period.
To manage liquidity over a longer time period (1 year), BNI maintained its Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFSR) by increasing  the Bank’s funding stability, adjusted to the composition of assets and off balance sheet accounts.
NSFR is the ratio of the Available Stable Funding to the Required Stable Funding.
As of December  2022, BNI’s NSFR was 164.1% (Bank Only) and 165.72% (consolidated), above the regulatory requirement  for minimum NSFR fulfillment of 85% until January 31, 2023 or during the banking relaxation period. 2.
Bank Solvability: Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt BNI’s Capital Adequacy Ratio - CAR is the ratio of capital to Risk Weighted Assets - RWA.
In 2022  BNI’s CAR decreased to 19.3%, from 19.7% in 2021.
This shows that BNI’s capital structure has the  capability to be able to offset loan risk, market risk and operational risk, as the ratio is higher than  the minimum CAR set by the regulator.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR CAPITAL  STRUCTURE AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  KEBIJAKAN MANAJEMEN ATAS STRUKTUR MODAL BANK BNI manages the Bank’s capital to maintain a strong capital position to support business growth and  maintain investor, depositor, customer and market confidence, and to ensure adequate capital to meet  regulatory requirements, and to cover risks managed by the Bank.
When managing capital, the Bank  considers factors such as: optimizing capital return to shareholders, maintaining a balance between  higher profits and gearing ratios, and the security provided by a healthy capital position.
This is carried  as BNI has a strong commitment to maintaining its capital structure composition in accordance with  applicable provisions, and does not violate the minimum limit provisions applied by the Financial Services  Authority (OJK) as the banking regulator.

BNI’s core capital increased by 5.5% from Rp112.7 trillion in 2021 to Rp118.9 trillion in  2022.
This increase was due to an organic increase through retained earnings, and changes in the potential  profit/(loss) position of changes in the fair value of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, where in 2021 the potential fair value of financial assets was in a profit position  Rp1.9 trillion, while in 2022 the potential fair value of financial assets was in a loss position of Rp2.0 trillion.
Supplementary Capital (maximum 100% of core capital)Supplementary capital (referring to the Bank capital) consists of general reserves for productive assets and capital instruments that meet Tier 2 requirements.
BNI’s supplementary capital decreased by 4.1% from Rp12.9 trillion in 2021 to Rp12.4 trillion in 2022.
This was due to a decrease in the value of sub-debt,  calculated in supplementary capital (Tier 2) from the amortization of the value of the sub-debt until  maturity. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk390 391 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceRisk Management Practices The Bank’s Health Level (BHL) Assessment is reported to the regulator (OJK) every 6 months (semi- annually) in June and December.
The results of the BNI BHL assessment for the period to December 31,  2021 were rated “Healthy” (stable compared to the previous year), meaning that:1.
The Bank’s condition is generally healthy, and is considered capable of facing significant negative  effects from changes in business conditions and other external factors; 2.
The assessment factor ratings (Risk Profile, Governance, Profitability, and Capital) are generally good.
If there are weaknesses, then in general these weaknesses are less significant.
BNI’s risk profile, as one of the BHL assessment factors for the December 31, 2022 period, was ranked 2 (Low to Moderate).
As a result of BNI’s risk profile being in the Low to Moderate level, and based on  calculations using the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the minimum CAR based  on the risk profile was 9.8%.
If added to the buffer capital, the Conservation Buffer 2.5%, Countercyclical  Buffer 0.0% and Capital Surcharge 1.5%, then the Minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (KPMM) was 13.8%.

Compared to the 2022 target, loan disbursement exceeded the loan  disbursements the previous year.
For total TPF, collecting customer deposits also exceeded the 2022 target, especially  for demand deposits.
Even though deposits recorded achievements below the target, the good performance of  demand deposits and savings had a positive impact on the growth of BNI’s low-cost funds.

TARGET ACHIEVEMENT IN 2022 The Assumptions Used and Process for setting Target for 2022  In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia and many other countries was coming under control.
People’s mobility and the economy were gradually returning to normal.
Indonesia’s trade balance has  shown a surplus since May 2020.
Domestic economic growth in the QI 2022 (5.01% yoy) and in QIV  2021 (5.02% yoy).
Nevertheless, the positive growth of the national economy was still overshadowed by rising inflation  due to soaring commodity prices and demand that had increased beyond supply.
During the process  of establishing the 2022 targets, Bank Indonesia believed that the inflation rate in 2022 would reach an  upper limit of 4%, then in 2023 it would subside again.
The IMF and World Bank projected that Indonesia’s  economic growth in 2022 would be 5.4% and 5.1%, better than the economic growth of other countries, as Indonesia’s economic structure is supported by commodity exports.
This was reinforced by historical data showing that Indonesia’s economic growth pattern and inflation rate are positively correlated with trends in export commodity prices.
The positive growth of the Indonesian economy had an impact on banking performance.
Loan growth  continued its positive growth from June 2021.
Loan risk also showed a decline, especially in the QI 2022.
Historically, banking NPLs have been more influenced by falling export commodity prices (palm & coal) and are less sensitive to rising inflation and oil prices.
However, risks are still being watched due to the uncertainty over the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the threat of stagflation, especially in  developed countries, such as the United States and the Eurozone as well as increases in global benchmark  interest rates.
Looking at data & information on economic developments during the process of setting the 2022 target,  and taking into account the Government’s direction and the Authorities’ economic policies, the projections  for Indonesia’s 2022 macroeconomic indicators were as follows: Indicator 2022 Assumptions Economic Growth (%) 5.0 s.
d 5.5 Inflation  (%) 4.00 s.
d 5.00 Rupiah/United States Dollar Exchange Rate (Rp) 14,000 s.

However, Indonesia’s economy is expected to continue to grow at a higher rate than most other countries.
Based on historical track records, global recessions generally have less of an impact on developing countries, including and especially Indonesia.
The high  contribution of domestic consumption and low exposure to exports/imports helps support the Indonesian  economy during times of global economic shocks.
In 2023, the economy is expected to grow by 5.0% supported by household consumption, investments,  Government spending and net exports.
Inflation is expected to decline to 3.8% after the impact of the  fuel price hike on consumer inflation subsides.
Pressure on the Rupiah exchange rate is expected to occur  early in the first half of 2023 due to an increase in the benchmark interest rate in the United States, but it  should ease in the second half of the year underpinned by Indonesia’s strong economic fundamentals in  terms of controlled inflation and good economic growth, which will attract capital flows intothe country.
To anticipate the Rupiah’s volatility, and the ongoing monetary tightening policy in the US, Bank Indonesia’s  benchmark interest rate rose to 5.75% in the first half of 2023, and is expected to remain at that level  throughout 2023.
From the banking industry perspective, the stability of the domestic economy will be catalyst for healthy  business growth.
Bank loan growth in 2023 is estimated to be in the range of 7-9%, and TPF growth at a level of 7.2%-8.5%.
Macroeconomic Projection Macroeconomic Indicator 2022 2023F Real GDP Growth (% YoY) 5.3 5.0 Private Sector Consumption (% YoY) 4.9 4.8 Government Consumption (% YoY) (4.5) 6.1 Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation (% YoY) 3.9 3.6 Exports of Goods and Services 16.3 8.4 Imports of Goods and Services 14.8 9.3 Inflation Rate (% YoY) 5.5 3.8 BI7DRRR (%) 5.5 5.8 Exchange Rate (Annual average, Rp/USD) 14,874 14,950 Current Account Balance (% of GDP) 0.99 (0.2) Loan Growth (%) 11.4 7 .0 – 9.0 TPF Growth (%) 9.0 7 .2 – 8.5 PERFORMANCE PROJECTIONS AND STRATEGIC PLANS FOR 2023 Taking into account the prospects and business potential as well as macroeconomic conditions, BNI  estimates that Indonesia’s economic growth in 2023 is at 5%, with loan growth in the range 7.0% to 9.0%  and industry TPF growth by 7.2% to 8.5%.
Using these assumptions, BNI prepared a Bank Business Plan (RBB) for 2023, with the following financial targets:Performance Indicator 2023 Projection Quality balance sheet growth Credit Growth 9.0% s.
d 10.0% TPF Growth 6.0% s.
d 7 .0% NPL Gross < 2.5% Profitability Net Interest Margin (NIM) >4.8% Return on Equity (ROE) - Equity Based 15.7% s.
d 16.0% Our asset growth focus will be on healthy and good quality asset growth, and BNI is targeting loan growth in the range of 9.0% to 10.0% with a maximum gross NPL of 2.5% in 2023.
To support loan disbursements, Third Party Funds growth is targeted at 6.0% to 7.0%.
These quality balance sheet growth target should have a positive impact on BNI’s profitability, so we project NIM  to be in the range of > 4.8% and ROE Equity Based in the range of 15.7% to 16.0%.
To achieve these targets, BNI has determined the following strategic steps for 2023:1.
Developing transaction & ecosystem solutions to meet customer needs. 2.
Developing technology infrastructure and digital innovation through data driven based on analytics, customer experience, and expanding partnerships. 3.
Focusing on sustainable improvement of CASA and FBI. 4.
Increasing business expansion in the corporate top tier and priority sectors, value chains and cross selling by prioritizing a risk culture. 5.
Continuing the transformation of human capital, culture and operations so they are more agile and lean in  supporting the business. 6.
Strengthening the international business networks to support global market penetration. 7.
Optimizing BNI Group synergy by strengthening the position of Subsidiaries.

In line with the Bank’s business  strategy, this year’s workforce planning strategy will continue to focus on lending, risk, and digital/IT  functions.
To meet employee needs, BNI has a number of programs including the Assistant Development Program  (ADP) and the Officer Development Program (ODP).
This recruitment plays an important role in ensuring  the availability of talent that is in line with the Bank’s business needs, both for the present and for the future.
During 2022, BNI recruited 342 employees through various ODP channels.
BNI also supports the BUMN  Ministry’s program and participates in the BUMN Joint Recruitment Program (PPB) to fill the needs of employees in a number of BNI business units.
employee Development through an integrated  Career Management Strategy BNI view is that ensuring the availability of agile  leaders with qualified leadership capabilities and global  perspectives requires time and long-term programs.
Therefore, BNI specifically pays attention to career  management aspects so that the Company can develop  the best talent who will become the future leaders.
The  talent management programs implemented in 2022  include:  1.
Revamping Career Management Strategy This program is part of BNI’s transformation and aims  to improve the process of managing & developing  employee careers, especially for those categorized  as Talent at BNI.
This will be achieved through  strengthening the role of Human Capital, improving  business processes, and preparing a structured talent  development plan.
The results of the transformation is the improvements in  the Talent Management policy, including Classification,  Development & Mobility.
Implementation of this policy  is also supported by accelerating IT infrastructure  capabilities to facilitate the talent management  process effectively and efficiently. 2.
Individual Development Plan (IDP) Each employee has different development needs,  therefore BNI ensures that they each have an  Individual Development Plan (IDP), prepared based  on an assessment of current conditions and future  career plans for each employee.
When preparing the  IDP, each employee is required to have competencies  in the form of Hard Competency, Soft Competency, or Leadership Competency that will be developed  in the current year.
The competencies selected  for development are the result of joint discussions  between the employees and their superiors to ensure  that the development can be  carried out according to  its purpose.
The implementation of the development  program will then be facilitated by BNI Corporate  University.  3.
Career Acceleration In line with the Ministry of SOEs mission and the  Company’s strategy to facilitate young and female  talent with superior capacity and capability to fill  Company leadership positions, a Career Acceleration  program is provided using a speed track mechanism.
Speed track is a career acceleration path that allows  employees to occupy one position for a shorter period  of time (accelerated).
The selection of employees to occupy leadership  positions through the Career Acceleration program  is carried out through rigorous selection to ensure  that employees participating in this program have  sufficient capacity and capability as well as high  learning agility before occupying the target position 4.
Global Postgraduate ProgramIn line with the strategy to expand its reach globally, BNI provides opportunities for employees who wish  to develop their knowledge with Masters Scholarships  at the Top 50 World Universities through its Global Postgraduate Program (GPP).
Global postgraduate program testimonials bni46Yosep abdulhalim wardani - Master of Business administration –  nanyang technological university Singapore)  The BNI Postgraduate Program gave me the opportunity to continue my  education at one of the best universities in the world, namely Nanyang  Technological University (NTU) Singapore through a Master of Business  Administration (MBA) study program.
One interesting fact that I found  while studying here, was that we don’t only learn in the classroom, but we  also learn to be business consultants who are given full responsibility for  handling “real clients”, so the learning experience became very interesting  as we can immediately apply the knowledge gained in class in making an  analysis of the project being handled.
Other from that, we also had the opportunity to learn about technology and innovation at Tsinghua University China and learn about leadership at the University of California, Berkeley USA.
The BNI Postgraduate Program provides an extraordinary opportunity  for all BNI Hi-Movers to develop themselves and pursue their dream of  receiving an education from the world’s best campuses.
This experience was one of the best moments of my life.
I not only learned hard skills but  also soft skills working in a new and multicultural environment.
Hopefully  more and more BNI Hi-Movers will have the opportunity to continue their  education to a higher level. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk436 437 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceGlobal postgraduate program testimonials bni46 Dita oktro Chusnul Chotimah – Master of arts in Global Digital  innovation – korea advanced institute of Science & technology(kaiSt) One of the conditions for the BNI Global Postgraduate Program scholarship  is being accepted into one of the Top 50 Universities by Subject, where  the struggle to get in was not easy for me but it was a worthwhile journey.
During this submission process, my supervisor always encouraged and  reminded me not to give up.
This confirmed to me that BNI does not only  facilitate its employees to continue their higher education but also serves  as a support system for its employees.
Thank God, in September 2022 I finally had the opportunity to study my  Master of Arts in Global Digital Innovation (GDI) at the Korea Advanced  Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) with a full scholarships from  KAIST and BNI.
In the field of technology, KAIST is the best university  in South Korea and is ranked 20th in the field of Subject Engineering &  Technology.
The GDI curriculum is designed to prepare prospective IT  Leaders working in various countries.
Here, I was taught a lot to understand technology as a whole, not only  from the technical context but also from the socio-managerial context,  looking for added value of technology for the users.
In addition, GDI actively  sends its students to various conferences to broaden their insight into the  latest technological developments and facilitates collaboration projects between countries that can be used to achieve BNI’s Go Global vision.
Studying at one of the best universities in the world in a country that  became independent around the same time as Indonesia, but whose  economic and technological developments are much faster has given  me a new perspective and optimism, to be able to contribute better to my country, especially BNI.
It’s worth fighting for!
bni46 roy alfred Bohalima - Faculty of Business and economics - university of Melbourne, australia Becoming a participant in the BNI Global Post Graduate Program (GPP)  was one of the proudest experiences I’ve ever had.
I really enjoyed my  participation in this program as the facilities provided were very complete  and guaranteed so that all my needs during the study period could be met  and I could fully concentrate on completing my studies comfortably.
It  was through this program that I successfully completed my postgraduate  education at the Faculty of Business and Economics - University of  Melbourne, Australia.
Undergoing education at one of the top 50 best universities in the world  not only provided a wealth of updated knowledge in the field of strategic  management that I studied but also forged me personally to stand out  and become a global leader whose ideas are listened to and appreciated  by other fellow students coming from different countries and cultures.
I  am sure that with more and more young BNI talent participating in this  scholarship program, BNI will be able to create future leaders with the  global insight and capability to compete at the international level. 5.
Leadership Development Program   For facing increasingly complex competition, BNI must have a superior talent pool and be ready to  face numerous challenges.
Therefore, BNI needs to develop leadership competencies for its employees  on an ongoing basis.
BNI has developed a capability development program as part of employee career development  starting from leadership at the initial level to the highest level of leadership at BNI.
This program covers  knowledge, banking skills, personal competence and leadership to prepare employees to become  leaders both in their current and future positions.
This program has been specifically designed for  each level of employment as shown below:  Senior executive Management  program (SeMp) executive Management program (eMp) Middle Manager leadership program  (MMlp)advanced Manager leadership program  (aMlp) First line Manager leadership program  (FMlp) BNI also prepares succession planning in a structured way as a strategy and plan to develop all the  potential and capabilities of employees to ensure the readiness of candidates to become successors.

This workshop  was very interesting and useful and added to my knowledge.
One  thing I was taught about those things that were not too influential  when working but could cause problems in the future, for example  we should avoid multitasking and start focusing on task planning.
Also, we must have a growth mindset so that we don’t have a fixed  mindset for the dynamic changes that have occurred so far.
Taking this brevet added insight, made us understand more about  the art of leadership so that we could manage the team according  to expectations, Becoming wiser in making decisions, managing people by delegating  work to the team and creating a solid team needs a lot of knowledge  that we can apply when managing the team and carrying out daily  work to achieve the targets given. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk438 439 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformanceleadership Development program testimonials bni46 lea Beny Saputra - Service Quality Division Monitoring Group  leader advanced Manager leadership program participant I learned a lot during the training sessions.
As a leader, we should  be equipped with strategic orientation, change leadership, decision  making & strategic design thinking, with an agile & digital mindset,  to manage people & developing others, and other strategic aspects.
In my opinion, the training which was divided into several sessions,  was quite powerful.
Apart from in-class, we were required to follow the design thinking approach to develop an action learning project.
In addition, this program designed to produce BNI’s best talent,   also collaborates with fintech and unicorns in Indonesia as partners (internships) so that we can get many things and opportunities and discuss them with them.
This AMLP is proof that BNI is always working to improve competencies  and capabilities to produce BNI Hi movers who are reliable and capable  of facing current and future challenges and demands.
BNI Hi Movers  are educated and trained to have a skillset according to market needs.

Creating a Comfortable work environment to  work and Contribute optimally Management’s vision that places people comes first as  the focus by paying attention to the mental and physical  health of employees.
The focus on Employee Wellbeing  is expected to support the level of engagement from  employees, so that productivity increases.

One of the efforts to encourage and  realize this is through the formation of a community  for employees with the aim of facilitating employees  to develop hobbies and talent as well as maintaining  physical and mental health.
BNI has more than 20 communities based on the  hobbies and interests of employees, which are  gathered under a platform called 46Society.
Each unit  can create activities with the community, including  both sporting and artistic activities.
In addition, BNI is trying to proactively support work  life balance to encourage employee productivity by implementing a hybrid work model policy for  employees who do not serve customers directly.
To support this hybrid work model, BNI provides a  Work Hub as an alternative workplace for employees.
Work Hub provides complete facilities, including  adequate offices.
It is hoped that the existence of  the Work Hub can become a momentum to encourage  employee productivity and create a safe work  environment in the new normal era. 2022 Annual Report  >  PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk442 443 BNI for Stronger Indonesia2022  Performance Management Report Company Profile Capital & Risk ManagementPractices Good Corporate Governance Financial StatementsSocial &EnvironmentalResponsibility ESG CommitmentServing the Country, Pride of the Nation ManagementDiscussion andAnalysis on CompanyPerformance testimonials from community representatives (46 Societies)         It is an honor for me to work at BNI as BNI really supports all the communities in BNI, including the Gitaswara 46 community,  which is an association of BNI employees who love the world of singing (choirs, group vocals and solo singing).
