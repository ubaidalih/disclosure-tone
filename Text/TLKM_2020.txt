PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK 100 REPORT OF THE BOARD  OF COMMISSIONERS  AND DIRECTORSABOUT  TELKOMMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSISTELKOM  HIGHLIGHTSBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  OVERVIEW 2020 GLOBAL ECONOMY AND INDONESIA The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 impacted  the performance of various industrial sectors around the  world.
Following the stipulation of COVID-19 as a global  pandemic, uncertainty has increased so that investors have  tended to withdraw their funds from financial markets in  several developing countries.
Investors then divert it to  other assets that are considered safe, such as gold.
The  trade war between America and China that continued  until 2020 also impacted the economic downturn in  several countries including Indonesia, particularly in export  performance.
Based on the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, the  COVID-19 pandemic affected Indonesia’s Gross Domestic  Product (GDP), which contracted 2.07% throughout 2020.
In terms of Business Fields or Lapangan Usaha  (LU),  growth contraction occurred in almost all LUs, except for  those in particular related to anticipation and measures  to overcome COVID-19 and natural resources.
LU for  Information and Communication continues to grow in line  with the increasing broadband services need for homes and  the digital technology use to support the implementation  of work from home (WFH) and school from home (SFH).
In  2020, LU for Information and Communication experienced  a growth of 10.58%.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the main macro  indicators, the Rupiah exchange rate to the USD in 2020  has fluctuated slightly.
The Bank Indonesia transaction  rate was Rp13,895 per USD on January 2, 2020, and the  exchange rate on December 31, 2020, was closed slightly  lower at a value of Rp14,105.
The Bank Indonesia benchmark  interest rate (BI 7-day Repo Rate) decreased in January  2020 by 5% to 3.75% in December 2020.
Compared to  the previous year, all countries experienced a significant  economic slowdown.
The international rating agency Fitch  Rating maintains Indonesia’s Sovereign Credit Rating at  BBB (investment grade) with a stable outlook on August  10, 2020.
Then, Standard & Poor’s gave a BBB (Negative)  rating on April 17, 2020.
From a political perspective, the Regional Election (Pilkada)  in December 2020 was successfully carried out smoothly,  safely, and peacefully with the applicable health protocol.
It gives confidence to the investors and business people to  rebuild and realize the delayed business plans due to the  Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) implementation.
INDONESIA’S TELECOMMUNICATION  INDUSTRY Nowadays, the Indonesian telecommunications industry  grow rapidly, driven by the increase of fixed and mobile  broadband subscribers.
The shift from legacy services  to data services, which is supported by the availability of  smartphones at affordable prices, has attracted the youth  segment to contribute to this growth.
The increasing  number of broadband subscribers has made data service  prices more affordable and significantly reduced the SMS  and voice services demand.
On the other hand, data  services keep improving and become inseparable from  people’s economic activities.
In 2020, there were an increase in demand for fixed  broadband services in some large, medium, and small  cities.
The geographical challenges did not lessen the  Company’s interest to keep improving fixed broadband  services by developing investment in fiber-optic networks.
The national fixed broadband market condition currently  is still dominated by several companies because it requires  a high cost and takes a long time to build a fiber-optic  network.
In the Mobile segment, there is still intense operator  competition.
Various promotions were carried out, such  as offering bonus data to attract new customers and  retain existing customers.
The more easily accessed  promo information has made the competition between  the telecommunications industry even tighter.
Despite  pressure from OTT services in 2020, the cellular industry  in Indonesia, which refers to the three largest cellular  operators, increased by 0.6 million subscribers instead.
The SIM card penetration in the Indonesian cellular  industry is high over 100%, based on internal calculations  and available public data, which makes limited growth  room.
The subscribers of the three largest cellular  operators in Indonesia are Telkomsel, Indosat, and XL  Axiata contributed more than 80% of the market share  as of December 31, 2020.
Telkomsel remains the largest  cellular provider in Indonesia with 169.5 million subscribers,  decreased by around 0.9% with a market share of around  58.9%.
ANNUAL REPORT 2020101 APPENDICES CORPORATE SOCIAL  RESPONSIBILITYPARTNERSHIP AND  COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM (PKBL)CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE  GOVERNANCEData consumption in the Mobile segment still increases  and encourages Company revenue from data services  in the current digitalization era.
It is in line with the data  traffic volume increase from data communication services,  streaming video, games, content, applications, and the  increasing devices connected to the network.
On the  other hand, capital expenditure also should increase the  capacity to support the data services growth.
The Government by the Ministry of Communication and  Information has announced the new spectrum allocation  plan for telecommunications operators including to  facilitate the new technology development of 5G.
The  analog to digital TV migration, which expects to complete  at the latest by 2022, will provide a digital dividend of 112  MHz in 700 MHz frequency suitable for 5G services.
In line  with the Government’s initiative, the Company continues  to invest in the construction of BTS, core network, and  towers, both macro and micro towers, to meet the growing  needs for mobile data services.
The measures to increase  capacity, expand the 4G services coverage, and initiate a  precise and measurable 5G services development strategy  expected to increase subscribers’ satisfaction with the  digital service experience.
Throughout 2020, there was a demand increase for fixed  broadband services in some capital, medium, and small  cities.
It is mainly due to increased consumption driven by  the home broadband need since the COVID-19 pandemic  and work from home (WFH) and learn from home (LFH)  activities.
Geographical conditions, especially in the  suburban and rural area, is a challenge for fixed broadband  services improvement through the development of fiber  optic networks.
The current national fixed broadband  market is still dominated by several companies, due to the  high investment cost for the deployment of fiber optic  network infrastructure.
As of December 31, 2020, Telkom  had more than 8 million fixed broadband subscribers, even  though the penetration of fixed broadband services is still  relatively low in Indonesia.
Operators offer pay-TV, TV on- demand bundles, and other value-added service packages,  such as home security and smart home to attract new  customers.
On the other hand, the Enterprise segment  was under pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is in  line with declining economic conditions so that companies  or businesses tighten the budgets or postpone spending  to survive the recession period.
COMPETITION IN THE  TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY The rise of the digital economy has penetrated across the  socio-economic spectrum.
It is found by the Indonesian  people, especially in the many changes in market  behavior in economic activities.
The pace of change  continues to increase and accelerates in 2020 due to  the COVID-19 pandemic.
To anticipate competition,  TelkomGroup continues to provide various products and  services according to customer needs, such as cellular  services, fixed broadband, and fixed voice, enterprise,  interconnection, and satellite services.
Mobile Business As of December 31, 2020, Telkomsel remains the most  cellular provider in Indonesia with 169.5 million subscribers  and a market share of approximately 58.9% of the total  subscribers.
Furthermore, the next position of the largest  providers is Indosat and XL Axiata based on the internal  analysis.
Then, it follows by several other operators  that also provide cellular services in Indonesia, such as  Hutchison under the Tri brand and Sinar Mas Group under  the Fren brand.
As of the end of December 2020, SIM card penetration  growth in the cellular industry was above 100%, with a total  of 356.6 million subscribers, increased by 4.6% from 341.1  million subscribers as of December 31, 2019.
Data traffic  shows significant growth, while service traffic continues  to decline due to lower voice usage.
This declining trend  continued in 2020 and is predicted to continue for the  next few years due to the increase in smartphones that  replaced traditional voice and SMS services with Over The  Top services.
Fixed Voice & Broadband Business (Fixed Business) In the fixed broadband industry, TelkomGroup has several  main competitors of PT Supra Primatama Nusantara  (“BizNet Networks”), PT MNC Kabel Mediacom (“MNC  Vision”), and PT Eka Mas Republik (an affiliate of Smartfren  Telecom, which operates under the brand “MyRepublic”).
These brands have different target markets, such as MNC  Vision and MyRepublic have well-established household  target markets in the Jabodetabek area.
Then, BizNet has  a target market in the corporate and business segments in  Java and Bali.
PT TELKOM INDONESIA (PERSERO) TBK 102 REPORT OF THE BOARD  OF COMMISSIONERS  AND DIRECTORSABOUT  TELKOMMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSISTELKOM  HIGHLIGHTSWith its infrastructure, TelkomGroup is still superior in  terms of coverage throughout Indonesia.
During the last  three years, TelkomGroup has been trying to migrate  DSL technology to fiber-based broadband to improve  service quality and expand digital services.
The presence  of newcomers since 2019, namely a subsidiary of the  state-owned electricity Company PT Perusahaan Listrik  Negara (PLN) with the ICON+ brand and the State Gas  Company (PGN) with the Gasnet brand, has increasingly  enlivened the competition in the commercial internet and  TV services.
These competitors receive strong support  from their parent company in their distribution network  that certainly will strengthen their position.
Data Center TelkomGroup is committed to providing the best service  to customers in Indonesia and Southeast Asia with the  availability of data centers supported by submarine  cable networks and a comprehensive co-location service  designed to be flexible, modular, seamless, and scalable.
Telkom’s subsidiary, Telin, competes in the international  market with other major data center providers such as  Equinix, Global Switch, SGX, and Epsilon in Singapore.
In Hong Kong, Telin competes with SUNeVision, Equinix,  OneAsia Network, HKCOLO, and HK Exchange and  Clearing.
Several competing companies, including DCI  Indonesia, Indosat Ooredoo, Moratelindo, IDC Indonesia,  NTT Communication, Global Axcess System, Biznet,  Centrin Online, Cyber TechTonic Pratama, and Jup1terDC  have also established data centers in Indonesia.
International Traffic and Interconnection Business For traditional IDD (non-VoIP) international traffic  business, in Indonesia, there are only Telkom and Indosat.
However, the existence of OTT or digital communication  services such as Line, Whatsapp, and Skype create a  tighter competition because the VoIP services can open  international access.
It caused a decrease in Telkom’s  revenue contribution from traditional IDD (non-VoIP)  international traffic.
With the intense competition in the COVID-19 pandemic,  TelkomGroup prefers to provide a platform for OTT  services.
Thus, TelkomGroup can increase broadband  usage with a digital hub and Content Delivery Network  (CDN) that can generate revenue and profit for the  Company.
Network and Satellite Infrastructure Business In the infrastructure business, especially towers, Telkom  has several main competitors, including Tower Bersama  Infrastructure, Tunas Pratama Solution, PT Profesional  Telekomunikasi Indonesia, and telecommunication  operators Indosat and XL Axiata.
Telkom’s subsidiaries  that run tower businesses are Mitratel and Telkomsel.
The construction of new towers or co-location by leasing  towers by cellular operators is one of the strategies applied  to this business line.
The market share of TelkomGroup customers spread  across the Asia Pacific region, especially in Southeast Asia,  which has an archipelagic geographical condition, requires  satellites as telecommunications and broadcasting  infrastructure.
These satellite service capabilities  include broadband backhaul, cellular backhaul, TV on  demand, enterprise network, video distribution, military  and government networks, DTH television, aviation  communications, and disaster recovery.
In satellite business management, TelkomGroup competes  with other operators which already have satellites and  operators, and in the process of satellite development  in Southeast Asia and South Asia.
Some of the Telkom  satellites include the Telkom-3S Satellite operates in the  118 E orbital slot, the Telkom-2 Satellite in the 157 E orbital  slot, and the Merah Putih Satellite in the 108E orbital slot.

On the other hand, the activity  restriction stimulated the digitalization growth.
Work from home and online school policy promoted telecommunication  demand specifically for broadband service.
Financial performance in 2020 was negatively affected by the stagnant economic activities.
The enterprise segment was  the most pressured segment by the pandemic.
However, it positively impacted TelkomGroup’s financial performance by  the digital service and connectivity demand from personal and residential customers.
The highest contribution of Telkom and its subsidiaries revenue in 2020 was still from the Mobile segment of 61.5% or  Rp83,720 billion.

The COVID-19 pandemic  situation has indirectly encouraged Telkom to accelerate its  transformation to a digital telecommunication Company.
The Government’s consistency in maintaining sustainable  economic growth, including the potential for the digital  economy, opens opportunities for TelkomGroup business  development.

Amid a depressed national  economy, the telecommunications and information industry  in 2020 grew by 10.58%, in line with the development of the  digital economy, which is increasingly needed to support  people activities.
Meanwhile, the competition between  operators expected to be healthier with more focus on  the quality and variety of services according to customer  needs and growing market potential.

For the Consumer segment, Telkom has a great  opportunity in competition for fixed broadband service  providers.
Telkom focuses on delivering high-quality  fixed broadband services to meet internet needs while  at the same time supporting a variety of attractive digital  services.
The penetration of fixed broadband services in  Indonesia is still relatively low at around 15% and the need  for high-quality internet to homes increasingly needed,  in line with the working and studying at home trend,  and other activities such as shopping via e-commerce  or entertainment.
To increase coverage of broadband  services for Indonesian, Telkom also explores building  synergies between the Mobile and Consumer segments  with innovative fixed wireless product development that  can complement one another.
In the Enterprise segment, data center development  is one of the business lines that Telkom will develop in  the future.
The data center business has high potential  demand along with the development of digital services  such as e-commerce and various other digital solutions  and provides good profitability.

They are portfolio optimization, technology, organization, synergy and  operational excellence, individual and corporate culture, inorganic, and governance.

On November 2, 2020, the  Government passed Law Number 11 of 2020 regarding Cipta Kerja or Job Creation (Job Creation Law or Omnibus  Law).
The telecommunications sector in the Job Creation Law is regulated in Article 71.
The regulation amends several  conditions in Law Number 36 Year 1999 regarding Telecommunications (Telecommunications Law) that intends to  improve the industry with various business conveniences.
Currently, the Rancangan Peraturan Pemerintah (RPP) or  Government Regulation Draft is being drafted for the implementation of the Job Creation Law, which must be stipulated  3 months since Job Creation Law is passed.
The Government Regulation Draft on the implementation of the Work  Creation Law in Post, Telecommunication, and Broadcasting was reviewed by the public on November 14, 2020, to obtain  input from the society, industry, and other stakeholders.
The implementation impact may still change depending on the  applicable regulations later in the telecommunications industry.
Telkom’s review in general shows that there is not any  significant impact from the regulation implementation, that could impact on Telkom’s business strategy.
From the workforce regulations perspective, the Job Creation Law indicates a relaxation of the outsourcing condition  and the workers’ conditions with time work agreement (contract workers).
It generally supports Telkom’s to be more  agile and nimble in responding to various changes and needs in Telkom’s business.
On the other hand, there are several  arrangements regarding additional benefits for contract workers regulated in the Job Creation Law.
Telkom should wait  for the government regulation regarding the workforce, which is a derivative of the Job Creation Law to determine  the right strategy and measures in responding to the workforce policy changes, both for the condition relaxation and  additional obligations.
