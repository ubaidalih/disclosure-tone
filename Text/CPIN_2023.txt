BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND STRATEGYFood commodities made from poultry meat are  still a mainstay in public consumption, where the government always advocates consuming poultry meat and eggs, which are important staples and strategic sources of animal protein in order to reduce stunting and malnutrition rates.
Meat consumption per day is ideally 50-70 grams per day or 350-500 grams per week, in other words 18.25 kg per capita per year (Source: World Cancer Research Fund).
Assuming a population of 278 million people,  the estimated consumption of poultry meat in Indonesia in 2023 will be 12.58 kilograms per capita per year.
Meanwhile, if we refer to the prognosis for poultry production in Indonesia in 2023, it should be able to increase further to 14.33 kilograms per capita per year.
Then, the consumption figure for poultry eggs in 2023 is predicted to be 21.10 kilograms per capita per year.
Meanwhile, if we refer to the production prognosis figure, it can still be increased to 21.94 kilograms per capita per year (Source: Poultry Indonesia).
In addition, poultry is currently the cheapest  source of animal protein compared to other meats.
As a result, poultry meat is the best alternative for Indonesians in meeting their animal protein sources.
Despite the threat of disease and the fluctuation  in raw material prices, the agro-business industry in 2023 still showed significant growth.
Given the more rapid development of this industry, the Company has a vision to create a breakthrough through bio-technology development, which can offer benefits for both the public and shareholders and to set a strategy to maintain and even improve its performance.
