Indonesia ranks second to the United States as a country  that uses geothermal energy and has an installed capacity  of 2,132 MW.
The energy infrastructure development policies continue  to be directed towards an energy mix aimed at realizing: 1.
National energy independence and security; 2.
Optimizing the management of energy resources in  an integrated and sustainable manner; 3.
Increasing the efficiencies of energy used; 4.
Ensuring fair and equitable access to energy; 5.
Developing technological capabilities and the  domestic energy and energy services industry; 6.
Creating jobs; and 7.
Controlling the effects of climate change and maintaining the environment.
The main target for RES is for power plants, which will  then be developed for direct use in various user sectors.
To encourage its maximum use, the Government enacted  Presidential Regulation No. 22 of 2017 concerning the  National Energy General Plan (NEGP).
The target for  supplying power plants using RES is expected to reach 46,287 MW by 2025 with the RES composition as follows. 182 PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Laporan Tahunan Terintegrasi 2019Ikhtisar Kinerja Performance HighlightsLaporan ManajemenManagement ReportsProfil PerusahaanCompany ProfileTinjauan Pendukung BisnisBusiness Support Overview Following up on the NEGP, PT PLN (Persero) as the  BUMN whose main responsibility is to provide adequate  electricity to the people throughout Indonesia has drawn  up an Electricity Supply Business Plan (ESBP) for 2019- 2028.

To do so, the Company  conducts exploration and development activities to  ensure the availability of geothermal energy for a  sustainable production process.
As such, this operational  review is divided into two segments, namely steam and  electricity production and exploration and development.
Steam and Electric Production For its production activities, the Company distributes  geothermal steam from the production wells, after  separating various substances and materials contained  therein, to the PLTPs through a main control valve  - governor valve to turn the turbines that produce  electricity.
In addition, the voltage is increased through  a step-up transformer and then connected to the  distribution system managed by PT PLN (Persero).
Overall, the Company’s production at equivalent  electricity in 2019 increased compared to the previous  year.
Increased production was achieved in the  Lahendong and Ulubelu Areas.
Whereas, the Kamojang  and Karaha Areas saw a decline in production.
In addition,  the Lumut Balai Project only started active production in  2019.
Kamojang Area The production at equivalent electricity in the Kamojang  Area fell 6.90% from 1,870.96 GWh in 2018 to 1,741.90  GWh in 2019.
This was still 15.57% higher than the 2019  RKAP target of 1,507.27 GWh, due to improvements to  Unit 3 being delayed to 2020.
Lahendong Area The production at equivalent electricity in the Lahendong  Area increased by 13.02% to 819.81 GWh in 2019 from  725.37 GWh in 2018, 5.14% lower than the RKAP  target of 864.23 GWh.
The main reason for the under  production was due to the Unit 1 turbine control system  having to be operated manually, and it not becoming  fully operation until November 18, 2019.
In addition,  PLN’s load settings on Unit 2, and a shortage of steam  supply in Unit 3 also influenced the decline in the 2019  production.
Ulubelu Area The production at equivalent electricity in the Ulubelu Area in 2019 amounted to 1,563.66 GWh, a 10.92%  increase from 1,409.66 GWh in 2018, and 1.82% higher  than the RKAP target of 1,535.27 GWh.

The main reason for the  lower production in 2019 against the RKAP target was  the lack of steam supply, and subsurface constraints.
Lumut Balai Project In 2019, the Lumut Balai Unit 1 Project started operating with a production at equivalent electricity of 18.24 GWh.
However, this was still below the target as the scheduled  start of the PLTP was delayed due to generator circuit  breaker interruptions.
These PLTPs were not feasible to operate, as they  were damaged and used obsolete turbines.
Currently,  PGE is conducting an internal review for an alternative  use of existing resources in the Sibayak Area.
As the production was lower than the RKAP target, the  Company’s operating income was also lower than the RKAP.
