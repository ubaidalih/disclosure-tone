Indonesia is richly endowed with minerals and  resources, including gold, copper and nickel,  which are the main minerals mined by Merdeka.
Mining is an integral pillar of Indonesia’s economy,  contributing 9% of the total Gross Domestic Product in  2022 according to S&P Global.
Indonesia is globally the top producer of nickel and  a major producer of gold and copper.
According to  the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the  Republic of Indonesia and the U.
Geological Survey  of Mineral Commodity Summaries, Indonesia has the  largest reserves of nickel in the world accounting for 40%  of the total world reserves.
In 2022, the amount of nickel  ore reserves and resources in Indonesia was estimated  at 5.03 billion tonnes of reserves (Proved & Probable) and  17.33 billion tonnes of resources (Measured, Indicated  & Inferred).
Indonesia is also home to the world’s fifth  largest gold reserves ranked fifth globally, constituting  4% of the world’s total gold reserves at around  54,000  tonnes (Source: U.
Geological Survey, Mineral  Commodity Summaries, 2022).
In terms of copper, Indonesia is the world’s sixth-largest  producer of copper, with copper ore resources of  15.95 billion tonnes, copper ore reserves of 3 billion tonnes,  and copper metal reserves of 19.94 million tonnes.
Gold, Copper, and Nickel Prices in 2023 In 2023, the price of gold, copper, and nickel fluctuated.
Gold showed strong gains amid geopolitical volatility,  rising 15% in 2023 to reach US$2,078/oz, the highest  annual close on record.
Copper prices were generally  stable above US$8,000 per MT due to strong demand  for EV production and renewable energy projects.
Conversely, nickel prices declined as Indonesia increased  its nickel production through NPI, nickel matte, and  mixed hydroxide precipitate.
However, in the long term, demand for copper and  nickel is expected to accelerate as critical minerals in the  transition to clean energy.
In addition, closure of various  nickel mines around the world suggests that prices will  strengthen as supply drops.
Nickel and Copper Demand in  the Clean Energy Transition As a country with large nickel reserves, Indonesia is well- positioned to benefit from the growing demand for  nickel.
Nickel is a key mineral in EV batteries, which are  part of the global clean energy transition.
In response to this opportunity, the Indonesian  government has initiated measures to foster domestic  development of the EV value chain.
This includes  imposing restrictions on nickel ore exports and spurring  investments in Indonesia's nickel industry, particularly  in downstream activities.
With ambitious targets to  become an EV production hub, aiming for 300 thousand  EV cars and 2.5 million electric motorcycles by 2030,  Indonesia is poised to capitalize on the growing  EV market.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the demand for  batteries, which heavily rely on nickel, is projected to  surge, potentially constituting 41% of global nickel  demand by 2030, a significant increase from the 7%  recorded in 2021.
This underscores nickel’s substantial  role in powering the clean energy transition, positioning  Indonesia at the forefront of this transformative shift.
Since listing its shares on the IDX in June 2015, the  Merdeka Group has transformed from a company  with only one medium-term gold mine development  project into a diversified mining group with promising  long-term development and growth opportunities.
In 2023, Merdeka continued its transformative journey  for growth into a mining and minerals company with  globally significant gold, copper, and nickel assets  across Indonesia.
Merdeka achieved meaningful progress and  strengthened its position for long-term growth.
The  Company delivered solid operational results and  progress across its three major pillars, namely copper,  gold, nickel, and pyrite operations.
Operational  expansion and integration of newly acquired assets  remained key focal points, furthering the Company's  transition into a diversified producer with exposure to  the clean battery value chain through its ownership in  the MBMA Group.
As of 31 December 2023, Merdeka’s major portfolio  assets that have reached commercial operation  included BSI in the Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine, BTR and BKP  in the Wetar Copper Mine and Wetar Pyrite, as well as  CSID, BSID, ZHN, HNMI, and SCM in the MBMA Group.
Merdeka’s Group mineral resources are estimated to  contain 36.4  million oz of gold, 8.5 million tonnes of  copper, 86.0 million oz of silver, 13.8 million tonnes of  nickel, and 1.0 million tonnes of cobalt.
This represents  an increase of approximately 1.2  million oz of gold  (+3.5%), 69 thousand tonnes of copper (+0.8%), 6 million  oz of silver (+7.9%), and a decrease of approximately  57,000  tonnes of nickel (-0.4%) compared with the  estimates as of 31 December 2022.
In terms of group ore reserves, both copper and gold  increased significantly from 2022, by 632% and 832%  respectively, due to additional reserves from the Tujuh  Bukit Copper Project and Pani Gold Mines.
Nickel  reserves increased slightly by 4% compared to the  2022 reserves.
The Pani Gold Project has significant potential,  containing mineral resources of 303.1 million MT of ore  with a grade of 0.70 g/t gold, equivalent to 6.9 million  oz of gold.

Nickel matte production by the Company began in 2023.
Berdasarkan hasil tersebut, Perseroan mencapai kinerja  keuangan per segmen sebagai berikut:Revenue and Profitability by Segment    Gold emerged as the primary contributor to the  Company's revenue due to its substantial production and  favorable market prices.
However, copper production  fell short of expectations, resulting in a decreased  contribution to the overall revenue for the year.
While  NPI and nickel matte segments maintained positive  margins, they experienced a decline in profitability  compared to  2022 due to lower average sales prices  despite reduced cash costs.
Nickel production faced  challenges with rising operational expenses, driven  by increased prices of nickel ore, coal smelting, and  electricity.
To counteract these challenges, the Company  implemented cost-efficiency measures to safeguard  margins and enhance long-term business performance.
Gold Since 2012, the Company has been actively involved  in gold mining operations.
The development of the  Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine under BSI's leadership marked  a significant milestone, positioning it as one of  Indonesia's prominent gold mines.
Additionally, the  ongoing development of the Pani Gold Project holds  promise to further solidify the Company's foothold in  the gold mining sector, with expectations to become  one of Indonesia's leading primary gold mines.
Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine In production since 2017, the Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine has  been one of Indonesia's foremost primary gold mines,  managed by BSI, in which Merdeka holds a 99.89% share  ownership.
In addition to gold, the mine also produces  some silver.
According to the Consolidated Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves Report as of 31 December  2023, the Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine is estimated to have Ore  Reserves of 412 thousand oz of gold and 23.1 million oz of  silver and Mineral Resources of 1.2 million oz of gold and  66.4 million oz silver.
Located in Sumberagung Village, Pesanggaran Sub- District, Banyuwangi District, East Java Province, the  mine operates within a 4,998-hectare area, of which  BSI utilizes 992 hectares for mining activities.
Utilizing  a conventional open-pit mining approach, the mine  extracts mineral ores and extracts gold and silver deposits  using an efficient leaching method.
Activity and Production in 2023 In 2023, gold production saw a notable uptick of  10.8% to 138,666 oz, despite a 3.4% decline in gold  sales from 134,411 oz in 2022 to 129,867 oz in 2023.
This decline in sales is attributed to the timing  of transactions slated for recognition during  first quarter 2024.
Throughout the year, Merdeka continued exploration  with an aggressive drilling program that aimed at  extending the mine's operational life.
Recent drilling  and updated geological interpretation for controls  on the gold and silver epithermal mineralisation  have identified multiple near-mine targets to the  current operations.
Prices of consumables and components rose during  the year.
However, the implementation of several cost  reduction initiatives around processing consumables  use (cyanide, cement, and hydrogen peroxide) coupled  with haul fleet and haul road efficiencies mostly offset  the impact on margin.
Pani Gold Project Merdeka owns a 70.05% effective economic and equity  interest in the Pani Gold Project through the ownership  of the shares in PBJ.
Situated in Gorontalo Province,  Sulawesi, Pani encompasses a substantial untapped  gold resource spanning two adjacent mining tenements  (Contracts of Work owned by GSM and IUP-OP owned  by PETS), conveniently accessible via the Trans-Sulawesi  highway. 2023 Annual Report | PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk 147 Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis With its potential to emerge as one of Indonesia's  premier primary gold mines, Pani boasts significant  mineral resources, estimated at 6.9 million oz of gold.
Merdeka's vision is to mold Pani into a sustainable,  low-cost, and enduring gold mining venture.
The latest mineral resources report underscores  its potential, showcasing mineral resources of  303.1  million MT with a grade of 0.70 g/t gold  equivalent to 6.9 million oz of gold.
Pani is estimated to   start producing gold at the end of 2025.
Activity and Production in 2023 The culmination of the Pani Feasibility Study ("FS") in  the fourth quarter of 2023 marks a significant milestone.
This comprehensive analysis, curated by independent  technical consultants, certifies Pani as a low-risk, high- margin, and long-life open pit mining endeavor.
It adopts  a phased mine plan to optimize mineral resources  and maximize near-term cash flows.
With over 70,000 meters of drilling completed by the  end of December 2023, Merdeka’s focus is on delineating  mineralisation in areas of limited previous drilling to  test the continuity of mineralisation, and enhance  the data accuracy.
The Company is now preparing to  construct a heap leach with a first phase capacity of  7  Mtpa, for which earthworks construction activities  have commenced.
A site metallurgical laboratory facility  was also commissioned, enabling site-based column  leaching test work to continue uninterrupted while  construction activities continue.
A Carbon-in-Leach (CIL)  processing facility will be added in subsequent years.
A second phase of development in years to come will  increase production by adding a CIL gold recovery circuit,  processing up to approximately 12.0 Mtpa of ore.
To manage costs effectively, Pani is being executed cost- effectively by engaging in-house construction expertise,  combined with local contractors, and by adopting  a strategy for pit development and production that  optimizes the project capital expenditure and mining  schedule while maximising ore throughput and recovery  ore.
Future project expansion at Pani will be self-funding  once the initial heap leach processing commences.
Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk 148 Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis With a projected combined heap leach and CIL  processing capacity of 19.0 Mtpa, Pani is expected  to produce more than 500,000 oz gold per annum,  contributing significantly to Merdeka’s gold  production capacity.
Copper Merdeka's foray into copper mining commenced  in 2018 with the Wetar Copper Mine, distinguishing  itself as Indonesia's sole mine directly producing and  exporting copper cathodes.
Concurrently, the Company  is advancing the Tujuh Bukit Copper Project, poised  to become one of the globe's most significant pre- production copper projects.
Wetar Copper Mine The Wetar Copper Mine (Wetar) is operated by BTR and  BKP, which were acquired by the Company in 2018 and  currently the Company holds 99.99% direct and indirect  shares ownership in BKP and 99.99% direct shares  ownership in BTR.
Merdeka effectively owned 99.99%  ownership in Wetar.
Wetar controls a copper reserve of  53 thousand tons.
BKP, as the holder of an IUP-OP for copper, is responsible  for copper mining, while BTR, as the holder of an IUI for  the non-ferrous base metal manufacturing industry,  handles the processing and refining of mining products  into copper cathodes.
Based on BKP’s IUP-OP, the Wetar Copper Mine  is located in the Lurang and Uhak Villages, Wetar  Subdistrict, Southwest Maluku District, Maluku  Province, and occupies an operational area of  2,733 hectares, or 1.07 percent of Wetar Island’s total area  of 262,235 hectares.
Merdeka has established the AIM Project, which will  process the excess mineral content into battery raw  material to take advantage of the remaining mineral  content in Wetar that naturally cannot be extracted into  copper but still has economic value.
The existence of the  AIM Project, which is further discussed in the Nickel and  the AIM Project section, will increase production, and  extend the life of Wetar.
With the development of the AIM project, the focus  going forward will be on extracting added value from  the Wetar ore including the production of copper at  Wetar and the sale of ore to the AIM project to be used  to produce acid, iron, steam, copper, gold, and silver.
Activities and Production in 2023 During 2023, Wetar produced 12,706 tonnes of copper.
Production declined from 19,551 tonnes in 2022, among  other factors, due to the impact of slower leach kinetics  and lower-content ores with higher clay content.
Slower leach kinetics impacted the timing of copper  production at the back end of 2023.
The higher-clay  ore was mined to stockpiles for later treatment to  prevent it from impacting the heap performance.
The site infrastructure enhancement in 2023  encompassed the mid-year completion of the Wetar  Barge Jetty, the construction of which was successfully  handled internally.
In the second semester, Wetar delivered its first pyrite  ore, which was sold to the AIM Project operated by  MBMA Group, a Merdeka subsidiary.
For the full year,  Wetar delivered 30,000 tonnes of pyrite ore.
Exploration continued to take place through a drilling  program, which will continue in 2024 with the aim of  discovering new prospect areas.
Tujuh Bukit Copper Project The Tujuh Bukit Copper Project is fully owned by  Merdeka.
The project is one of the world’s largest pre- production copper projects, is located beneath the  operating Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine located in Banyuwangi,  East Java Province.
This project contains mineral resources of approximately  1.7 billion tonnes of ore containing 8.2 million tonnes of  copper and 27.9 million oz of gold (including 755 million  tonnes of indicated ore resources).
Since 2018, Merdeka has invested US$185 million on  detailed feasibility work to advance the project, including  a 1,890-metre exploration decline, resource  definition  drilling, geological modeling, technical studies, and  PFS, completed in May 2023.
The PFS confirms attractive project economics  for developing a globally significant, long-life,  underground mine adopting a phased approach.
At  full production, the Tujuh Bukit Copper Project will  process more than 24 Mtpa of ore to produce more  than  110,000  tonnes of copper and 350,000 oz of gold  per annum for a mine life of more than 30 years.
Recent drilling related to the extension of the Tujuh Bukit  Gold Mine has identified copper-gold mineralisation  extending from below the mine open pits to the  underground indicated resource.
The potential mining  of this copper-gold mineralisation from an open pit is  a low-risk, brownfield expansion of the existing mining  operations.
It would potentially increase, accelerate and  de-risk the initial production profile of the Tujuh Bukit  Copper Project.
Preliminary drilling of this potential  open-pit copper-gold resource and other high- priority open-pit prospects within the concession area  is ongoing.
Following the completion of the PFS and the discovery  of a potential open pit copper-gold resource, Merdeka  is focusing on project enhancement work, before  commencing with a feasibility study.
The optimisation  work includes the potential for improved metallurgical  recoveries, higher underground production throughput  and open pit mining of additional copper ore.
Underground resource definition drilling has progressed  well in 2023, with more than 30,000 metres completed  as of the end of December 2023.
Nickel and AIM Project The Company carries out vertically integrated nickel  mining and downstream nickel refining activities  through MBMA Group, which is owned by Merdeka  through MEN.
Nickel, as the most recent of the  Company’s assets, has further diversified the Company’s  business and given the Company exposure to the EV  battery value chain as an important component in the  clean energy transition. 2023 Annual Report | PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk 151 Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis Grup MBMA mengoperasikan tambang dan pabrik- pabrik peleburan nikel, yang terhubung dengan  pengembangan kawasan industri nikel di Sulawesi  Tengah dan Tenggara, Indonesia.
MBMA Group operates nickel mines and smelters,  which are linked to the development of nickel  industrial zones in Central and Southeast Sulawesi,  Indonesia.
Having gone public on the IDX in April 2023  (IDX: MBMA), MBMA Group is actively developing  an integrated value chain to become a key provider  of battery raw materials for the world’s EV, through  integrated business assets as follows:   • SCM Mine, producing nickel ore • RKEF Smelters • Nickel Matte Converter • AIM Project • HPAL smelter facilities • IKIP Production in 2023 MBMA Group year nickel production reached  95,450  tonnes, comprising 65,117  of nickel in NPI and  30,333 tonnes of nickel in nickel matte.
SCM Mine  SCM Mine, is a globally significant, cost-effective  and high-quality nickel mining operation producing  limonite and saprolite nickel ore, is owned by Merdeka  through the MBMA Group.
SCM holds an IUP for one  of the world’s largest pre-production nickel resources.
Spanning over 21,100 hectares in Routa Sub-District,  Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, on an area of  21,100 hectares, the SCM Mine contains approximately  13.8  million tonnes of nickel (1.20% Ni content) and  1.0 million tonnes of cobalt (0.09 % Co content).
In August 2023, the SCM Mine commenced supplying  saprolite ore to MBMA Group’s three nickel smelters  with RKEF technology in IMIP Central Sulawesi,  to  be  processed into NPI.
The NPI will then be  converted into nickel matte by HNMI, a nickel converter  plant acquired by MBMA Group in May 2023 with  a 60% ownership shares.
The other output of SCM Mining, namely limonite ore,  will be converted at the HPAL plant, including the  HPAL plant owned by the MBMA group to produce  MHP.
MBMA’s first HPAL plant is currently under  construction and is expected to start operating by  the end of 2024 at IMIP.
They are  respectively operated by CSID, BSID and ZHN, all of which  produce NPI.
CSID and BSID each have a nameplate  capacity of 19,000 tonnes of NPI per annum, while ZHN,  which completed construction in 2023, has a nameplate  capacity of 50,000 tonnes of NPI per annum.
ZHN  began operating in the second half of the year, while  CSID and BSID contributed full year production.
Nickel Matte Converter In the next stage of nickel processing, low-grade  nickel matte produced from NPI is sent to a HGNM  converter to produce High Grade Nickel Matte.
This HGNM facility is operated by HNMI, in which MBMA  acquired a 60% ownership shares on 31 May 2023.
The  facility has a capacity of 50,000 tonnes of nickel in nickel  matte, and is located in the IMIP, Central Sulawesi.
By acquiring an existing nickel matte converter,  MBMA benefits from immediate incremental  cashflow by selling a higher payability product.
Nickel matte is an intermediate product that is used  to produce nickel sulphate, an integral component  of the battery materials value chain.
AIM Project  The AIM Project processes spent ore and high-grade  pyrite ore from Wetar (a wholly owned subsidiary of  Merdeka) to become sulfuric acid, saturated steam, iron  ore pellets, copper cathode, lead-zinc hydroxides, gold  and silver.
The project has a nominal capacity of 1.2 mtpa  acid and steam.
MBMA Group holds an 80% ownership share in MTI,  which operates the AIM Project through the ownership  of shares in BPI.
The AIM project is run by MTI, which  is a company established based on a cooperation with  the subsidiary of Tsingshan Group and is located in IMIP,  Central Sulawesi.
In September 2023, the AIM Project received its first  shipment of pyrite ore from Wetar, to be processed  when it commences operations in early 2024.
The ore  is transported in open barges from Wetar Island to  IMIP port and transported to the AIM plant for further  processing to produce a suite of products including  2023 Annual Report | PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk 153 Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis produk termasuk asam sulfat, uap jenuh, pelet bijih  besi, katoda tembaga, hidroksida timbal-seng, emas,  dan perak dore.

• NPI revenue contributed US$452.4 million on  64,526  tonnes sold with an average selling price  of US$13,357/tonnes, compared to the prior year  revenue following the completion of the MBMA  acquisition on 17 May 2022 of US$422.0 million on  sales of 25,824 tonnes with an average selling price of  US$16,324/tonnes.
• Nickel matte revenue contributed revenue of  US$438.6 million on sales of 28,129 nickel matte at an  average selling price of US$15,592/tonnes.
The Group  commenced nickel matte production in 2023  following the acquisition of HNMI.
• Gold sales from the Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine contributed  revenue of US$261.8 million in 2023 from the sale  of 129,867 oz of gold at an average selling price of  US$1,939 per oz, while revenue in the previous year  was US$262.3 million from the sale of 134,411  oz  at an average selling price of US$1,827  per  oz.
The  decline in gold sales is attributable to timing  of sales, which will be recognised during Q1 2024.
• Wetar revenue decreased from US$183.8 million  in  2022 to US$113.4 million in 2023.
This was mainly  driven by lower copper sales from 20,338 tonnes with  an average sales price of US$9,035 per tonnes in 2022  to 13,217 tonnes in 2023 with average sales price of  US$8,578 per tonnes.
The decline in copper sales was in  line with lower copper production which was caused by  unscheduled interruptions in the delivery of explosives.
Cost of Revenue In line with the increase in revenue, the cost of revenue  also increased by 121.4% from US$705.2 million in 2022 to  US$1,561.1 million in 2023.
The increase in cost of revenue  is reflective of the enlarged NPI production profile  following the successful commissioning of the  ZHN  smelter and acquisition of a 60% interest in the HNMI  nickel matte converter in May 2023.
In addition, there was  also contribution from higher mining costs, processing  costs, depreciation and amortization costs which in line  with the increase in production, as well as additional  cost of revenue from MBMA Group acquisitions.
EBITDA The group generated EBITDA of US$241.5 million in 2023,  representing a 2.6% increase.
The increase in EBITDA  is attributable to a US$98 million nickel contribution  from MBMA Group netted off with lower gold and  copper production from Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine, the  Wetar Copper Mine and lower NPI EBITDA  margins.
In 2023, NPI EBITDA margin was US$1,347/tonnes  compared to US$2,126/tonnes in 2022.
Profit for the Year The group generated profit for the year amounting  to  US$5.7  million, lower compared to US$64.8 million  in 2022.
• A reduction in the gross profit margin is mainly  attributable to the fall in the average selling  price of NPI from US$16,324/tonnes in 2022 to   US$13,536/tonnes  in  2023.
One of the primary NPI  production cost components is the nickel ore price,  which varies depending on the international nickel  price and global supply conditions.
Hal  ini terutama  disebabkan oleh naiknya aset tetap, persediaan, pajak • Finance expenses have increased due to higher  interest rates and overall debt levels incurred  in support of the Company’s transformational  growth, underpinned by acquiring MBMA assets,  the construction of the AIM Project and ongoing  development costs for Pani and the Tujuh Bukit  Project.
