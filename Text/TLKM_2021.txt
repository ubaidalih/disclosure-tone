100 PT Telkom IndonesIa (Persero) TbkBUSINESS   ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW 2021 The year 2021 was expected to be a turning point in the  economic recovery of all countries worldwide.
Each country is making various measures and policies to suppress the COVID-19 pandemic to control its spread by mobility restriction and mass vaccination programs.
These measures aimed to restore the world economy to normal before the pandemic.
Based on the October 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report, the IMF predicted the global economy in 2021 to grow by 5.9%, higher than the growth achieved in the previous year, which contracted at 3.1%.
It was supported by the addition of a robust fiscal stimulus and faster vaccinations that reopened broader community activities, especially in developed countries such as the United States and Europe.
However, the global economic recovery is still uneven,  which is caused, among other things, by differences in the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the speed of vaccination, and support for economic stimulus.
In general, the developed countries experienced a projection increase supported by the economic activity reopening, high vaccination coverage, and high fiscal stimulus.
Meanwhile, most developing countries had a decline in projections due to implementing a stricter community activity restriction policy amid the spread of the Delta COVID-19 variant.
The lower vaccination rate was also a risk to future economic recovery.
The prediction of global economic growth of 5.9% in  the WEO report released in October 2021 is a revision to the projection released by the WEO in July 2021, with a decrease of 0.1%.
The decline in the 2021 economic growth projection occurred widely in both developed and developing countries.
The two largest economies in the world, the United States and China, also received growth revisions to 6% and 8% in 2021.
Meanwhile, ASEAN-5 also experienced a decline in growth predictions to 2.9%, decreased by 1.4% toward the released WEO report of July 2021.
In line with global economic conditions, Indonesia’s economic recovery still continues.
Indonesia’s economy grew by 3.69% in 2021.
It was supported by stable export performance and the revived consumption and investment activities in line with easing people’s mobility restrictions.
Looking at the leading macro indicators, the Rupiah exchange rate against the USD throughout 2021 experienced a slight fluctuation.
The selling rate for Bank Indonesia transactions on January 4, 2021 was Rp13,973 per USD, while the selling rate on December 31, 2021 was closed at Rp14,340 per USD.
Meanwhile, the Bank Indonesia benchmark interest rate (BI 7-days repo rate) decreased slightly from 3.75% in January to 3.50% in December 2021.
Indonesia’s economic resilience in the face of the  pandemic is also quite good compared to many other countries.
Rating agency Fitch Ratings maintains Indonesia’s credit rating at BBB Outlook Stable as of November 2021, while Moody’s maintains Indonesia’s rating at Baa2 with Outlook Stable in February 2022.
It is an outstanding achievement for Indonesia amid a pandemic, which is in 2020, 3 world rating agencies, namely Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch, have taken 124 downgrades to 53 countries and revised the outlook to negative 133 times for 63 countries.
Indonesia’s economic activity is recovering gradually from the pressure of COVID-19, supported by policies to handle the pandemics that are getting better and are encouraged by efforts to accelerate vaccination by the government.
INDONESIAN   TELECOMMUNICATIONS  INDUSTRY Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the  telecommunications industry growth still grew and was relatively stable.
The increasing digitization and the internet demand to support people’s activities influenced this growth.
In Q1 2021, Indonesia, with a total population of 274.9 million people, had 202.6 million internet users or equivalent to 73.7% of the total population, increased by 15.5% or 27 million internet users compared to Q1 2020.
It indicates that the lifestyle and economy digital change have become more evident and increased the internet services demand, both fixed broadband and mobile (cellular), which are the main factors in the development of the telecommunications industry.
Telkom has a vital role in supporting Indonesia’s economic growth for the digital economy in particular and has the opportunity to become a digital telco leader in Indonesia and regionally.
However, competition in the telecommunications industry GLOBAL ECONOMY AND   INDONESIA 101 annual report 2021Mana GeMent DISC uSSIon anD anal YSIScontinues, especially in the mobile segment, where  penetration is increasingly saturated,  accompanied by price wars and substitute products from OTT.
In addition, cellular operators have also started implementing Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) services to expand their market coverage.
Cellular operators have also started developing 5G technology so that operators will compete to provide 5G services to support the advancement of the telecommunications industry and develop its various derivative industries. 2021 was also marked by the continuing process of  industrial consolidation, which finally materialized in early 2022 when Indosat merged with Tri, and Axiata Group (a shareholder of XL Axiata) acquired PT Link Net Tbk.
These consolidations between operators were positive for the telecommunications industry, expecting that the quite intense competition will become healthier, and in turn, all operators will enjoy sustainable growth.
The cellular market in Indonesia is also still dominated  by three cellular operators, namely Telkomsel, Indosat Ooredoo, and XL Axiata.
The total subscribers of the three cellular operators were more than 79.4% market share as of December 31, 2021.
Telkomsel remains the largest cellular provider in Indonesia with 176.0 million subscribers and a market share of approx. 59.3% of the total subscribers of the 3 largest cellular operators in Indonesia.
Data consumption in the Mobile segment continues to increase.
It drives company revenue from data services, in line with the increase in data traffic volume, from data-based communication services, video streaming, games, and content and applications.
In addition, this is also in line with the increasing number of devices connected to the network.
In the future, it will increase in line with the development of 5G network services that Telkomsel began to introduce on May 27, 2021.
On the other hand, capital expenditure is also essential to increase capacity to support the growth of the data service.
Tower infrastructure is essential in supporting the cellular service networks availability and plans for developing and implementing 5G, which require significant investments.
Therefore, Mitratel, a subsidiary of Telkom which is engaged in the tower business, was listed on the stock exchange on November 22, 2021, with the code MTEL.
It was one of Telkom’s strategic plans through an IPO in increasing the Company’s value.
Mitratel has acquired 4,000 towers from Telkomsel so that it has 28,079 towers and remains growing to fulfill its vision of becoming the leading and best provider in telecommunication tower infrastructure in Southeast Asia.
In 2021, the demand for the fixed broadband industry  increased in big, medium, and small cities.
It was due to the consumption-driven by the increasing home broadband demand in line with the people’s needs for work from home (WFH) and school from home (SFH).
Compared to the previous year, IndiHome subscribers increased and still dominate the fixed broadband market in Indonesia.
As of December 31, 2021, Telkom has around 8.6 million subscribers of IndiHome fixed broadband or market share estimated around 80.2%.
The high internet usage or traffic for mobile and fixed  broadband and the use of various digital services, has impacted on the high demand for data center and cloud businesses.
Telkom built a Hyperscale Data Center (HSDC) on Tier 3 and Tier 4 data center specifications on a 65,000 m 2 area with a total planned capacity of 75 MW.
HDC will  be built in stages, where Phase 1 with a capacity of around 22 MW is expected to be completed in Semester 1 2022, and complements the existing 26 data centers, namely 21 domestic data centers and 5 international data centers, including Tier 3 and 4 data centers in Jurong, Singapore.
Telkom’s total data center capacity that in December 2021 was 5,039 racks for domestic data centers.
Meanwhile for international data centers, they were 16,542 KW in Singapore, 250 kVA in Timor Leste, and 500 kVA in Hong Kong.
Besides digital connectivity and digital platform,  digital services are also the primary support for the telecommunications business.
By the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, digitization or lifestyle transformation towards digital are more tangible.
Telkom seeks to seize these opportunities, including through Telkomsel, which formed the Telkomsel Digital Ecosystem (TED) to accelerate digital business development.
In the early stages, TED will focus on 3 vertical digital businesses, including games (Dakota), health-tech (FITA), and edu-tech (Kuncie). 102 PT Telkom IndonesIa (Persero) TbkTELECOMMUNICATION   INDUSTRY COMPETITION Digital transformation has developed and penetrated all  sectors, both social and economic.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, various community activities have shifted towards online activities so that digital transformation is increasingly accelerated and encouraged as one of the main policy pillars in Indonesia.
TelkomGroup provides multiple products and services according to the community’s needs, such as cellular services, fixed broadband, fixed voice, enterprise, interconnection, and satellite services.
Mobile Business Throughout 2021, Telkomsel remained the largest cellular provider in Indonesia with approximately 176.0 million subscribers and a market share of around 59.3% of the total subscribers of the 3 largest cellular operators in Indonesia.
The next most significant provider position was Indosat Ooredoo and XL Axiata based on the internal analysis results.
Several other operators also provide cellular services in Indonesia, such as Hutchison Tri (3) and Smartfren Telecom.
Until December 2021, SIM card penetration in the cellular industry had growth of 6%, with 374 million subscribers, increased by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
Data traffic showed significant growth, while voice and SMS continue to decline.
The declining trend is predicted to continue for the next few years due to the increase in smartphones substituting traditional voice and SMS services for Over the Top (OTT) services.
Fixed Broadband & Fixed Voice  Business (Fixed Business) At the end of 2021, Telkom remained the largest fixed  broadband business operator in Indonesia through its IndiHome brand, with approximately 8.6 million subscribers and an estimated market share of around 80.2%.
Some of the main competitors in the fixed broadband industry, namely PT Link Net Tbk (First Media), PT Supra Primatama Nusantara (Biznet Home), PT MNC Kabel Mediacom (MNC Play), PT Eka Mas Republik (affiliated with Smartfren Telecom and operating under the My Republic brand), and PT XL Axiata (XL Home Fiber).
We should consider other competitors in the retail market of Cyberindo Aditama (CBN Fiber) and PT Oxygen Multimedia Indonesia (an affiliate of Moratelindo and operating under the Oxygen.
id brand), which previously operated in the corporate segment and are now starting to enter the retail of residential market.
However, Telkom is still superior in coverage and infrastructure, which has spread throughout Indonesia.
The competition in the commercial internet services has been higher due to newcomers, namely a subsidiary of PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) with the Iconnet brand and the State Gas Company (PGN) with the Gasnet brand.
Data Center Telkom is committed to providing the best data center service to customers in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
Telkom’s data centers are supported and integrated by domestic and global networks featured with comprehensive data center services designed to be flexible, modular, seamless, and scalable.
Telin, as Telkom’s subsidiary providing a global data center, competes in the international market with other large data center providers in Singapore and Hong Kong.
While in domestic market, Telkom competes with several data centers companies in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other major cities, such as DCI Indonesia, Indosat Ooredoo, Moratelindo, IDC Indonesia, NTT Communication, Global Axcess System, Biznet, Centrin Online, Cyber   TechTonic Pratama, and  JupiterDC.
International Traffic and  Interconnection Business Currently, the only traditional IDD non-VoIP international  traffic service operators in Indonesia are Telkom and Indosat.
Competition in this line of business is getting more challenging due to the presence of OTT and digital communication services such as Line, WhatsApp, and  103 annual report 2021Mana GeMent DISC uSSIon anD anal YSISSkype.
All three are VoIP service provider applications  that can open international access.
The presence of the OTT contributed to the decline in Telkom’s revenue from traditional IDD (non-VoIP) international traffic.
With intense competition, plus the COVID-19 pandemic during the last two years, Telkom responds to OTT by positioning OTT as a customer, partner, and/or competitor to obtain maximum added value for TelkomGroup.
The scope of service delivery/cooperation with OTT includes connectivity, data center, and Content Delivery Network (CDN) services that provide revenue or increase profits for the Company.
Network and Satellite Infrastructure  Business Telkom managed its business activities in the  infrastructure business line, particularly towers, by its subsidiaries of Mitratel and Telkomsel.
Telkom has several main competitors in the tower business, including Tower Bersama Infrastructure, Solusi Tunas Pratama, PT Profesional Telekomunikasi Indonesia, and telecommunications operators Indosat and XL Axiata.
Mitratel carries out an organic strategy by constructing new towers or co-locations to serve cellular operators.
In addition, Mitratel also carries out an inorganic strategy through tower consolidation within the TelkomGroup and tower acquisitions from other tower providers and telecommunication operators.
In satellite business, Telkom’s customers are spread across the Asia Pacific, especially Southeast Asia.
The islands region’s characteristics require satellites as telecommunications and broadcasting infrastructure.
Satellite services include cellular backhaul, broadband backhaul, enterprise network, TV on demand, military and government networks, video distribution, DTH television, aviation communications, and disaster recovery.
In managing satellite business, Telkom competes with other operators developing satellites in Southeast Asia and South Asia.
The two satellites owned by Telkom include the Telkom-3S Satellite, which operates in the 118°E orbital slot, and the Merah Putih Satellite, which is in the 108°E orbital place.
In addition, in 2021, Telkom obtained the right to use the 113°E orbital slot by the MoCI Press Release dated January 5, 2021 No. 06/HM/KOMINFO/01/2021.
Telkom, through Telkomsat, plans to place a satellite with the latest technology known as High Throughput Satellite (HTS) before December 31, 2024.
Digital Business In 2021, the global technology giant had arrived and entered the domestic market.
In addition, several unicorns have penetrated several vertical industries (such as logistics, e-commerce, financial services, travel, and other industries), so the time to lead the market is minimal.
Telkom provides digital products to serve customers according to their needs.
Telkom orchestrates its digital products and attempts to synergize with existing businesses.
In addition, Telkom also carries out a partnership strategy both with parties who have competence in specific vertical fields to increase digital capabilities and investors to accelerate digital business scale. 104 PT Telkom IndonesIa (Persero) Tbk OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW BY BUSINESS SEGMENT MOBILE •	Provides high- speed connectivity  for Telkomsel’s  customers by  utilizing mobile voice,  SMS, mobile data  services, and mobile  digital services.

TelkomGroup still creates products, services, standards, and business models in line with the latest developments to maintain its competitive advantage and lead the competition.
Therefore, Telkom and its subsidiaries collaborate to invest in technology and infrastructure for increasing its value and providing the best digital experience for customers.
Mobile Segment Market Share We identify a positive trend of user engagement with the higher data users, and it has a reliable prospect due to its good fundamentals and an extensive network.
In 2021, Telkomsel was the first operator offering the first 5G network in Indonesia, so it is one step ahead of competitors competing to prepare the 5G network.
As of 2021, Telkomsel had 176.0 million cellular  subscribers, including 120.5 million mobile broadband subscribers.
It increased by 3.8% for cellular subscribers and 3.9% for mobile broadband subscribers compared to the previous year.

It was due to the intense competition among mobile operators, even worsened by the customer behavior transition from mobile broadband to fixed broadband.
Providers’ competition to provide complete network access at affordable prices is increasing.
Telkomsel performed a well-planned marketing strategy to maintain positive profitability and market share.
The Mobile segment needs to consider another factor to  maintain its stable market share: competition with Over-The-Top (OTT) services.

Consumer Segment Market Share The limited mobility that prompts customer habits changes to adjust working and to study at home using communication network facilities has had a positive impact on the Consumer segment.
It also encourages all telecommunications providers to compete in providing total network access at affordable prices.
Through IndiHome, Telkom can compete to meet people’s digital connectivity needs.
IndiHome is one of the growth factors for TelkomGroup’s business and has a role as a new growth engine that increases revenue very well.
The challenge is that IndiHome has to compete with other  major fixed broadband service providers such as First Media, Biznet Home, MNC Play, and MyRepublic, where the most challenging competitor is First Media, which has the highest subscribers.
IndiHome’s middle and upper-class household customers’ competitors are MNC Play and MyRepublic in Greater Jakarta.
Biznet is for retail customers in Java, Bali, and Sumatera.
We also monitor new competitors, namely ICON+, a PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) subsidiary which has started offering internet and TV services since 2019, and the Gasnet of Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN).

It aims to integrate fixed voice with fixed broadband and IP-TV based on digital connection with fiberoptic cable into one product and service.
Enterprise Segment Market Share TelkomGroup still encourages the growth of digital services such as the internet of things (IoT), cybersecurity, big data, and digital advertising to improve the performance of the Enterprise segment.

Therefore, Telkom strives to provide optimal value to shareholders by optimizing business and assets and ensuring that subsidiaries can focus on their business lines’ development and improvement.
Telkomsel has transferred 10,050 telecommunications towers to Mitratel.
Thus, Mitratel would become one of the largest tower providers in Indonesia.

Although this activity aligns with regulations requiring telecommunications companies to share infrastructure and network capacity, it remains a challenge for TelkomGroup.
It is a challenge because Telkom already has the most expansive network infrastructure capacity in Indonesia, but competitors could use Telkom’s infrastructure network with more affordable capital and expenses.

The Enactment of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) stopped people’s mobility in Q3.
However, the economic situation until Q3 2021 had a growth of 3.51%, which was a good starting point for Q4 2021 to 2022.
In Q4 2021, people’s mobility steadily increased, and several sectors began to recover, such as construction and transportation.
The Government expected society to maintain the balance by prioritizing health, vaccinating, and strictly implementing social distancing.
On the other hand, the telecommunications sector still  recorded a positive performance growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Government expected to support the acceleration of national economic recovery.
Mobility restrictions during COVID-19 have impacted the stable revenue growth in the telecommunications sector.
The PPKM policy to suppress the spread of COVID-19 was directly proportional to the increase in data users and consumption, thus becoming a catalyst for revenue growth for telecommunication companies.
Along with the increasing prospects for the  telecommunications business, the Ministry of Communication and Information (MoCI) stated it would continue expanding the internet network to remote areas.
One of the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures is the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS).
In 2021, the MoCI completed the construction of around 4,200 BTS, and the construction process will continue with the construction of 3,704 new BTS in 2022.
By 2024, it would complete building 9,586 BTS and be fully operational.
The prospect of the telecommunications business has  an excellent opportunity to improve its performance.
The higher chance is in line with the increasing internet demand within the country.
It is undeniable that digital services are increasingly important, so Telkom has encouraged accelerating its transformation into a digital telecommunication company.
Telkom remains strengthening its leadership position in its core businesses of digital connectivity, building and developing digital talent to accelerate digital platform growth, encouraging digital service innovation, and improving business value through portfolio optimization and lean organization.
TelkomGroup commits to providing reliable and high-quality fixed and mobile broadband services, other digital platforms, and services across the country to support people’s productivity and creative activities.
In the Mobile segment, Telkom notices the opportunities to increase growth potential in high-value customers, mobile solution services, and the various digital services development.
A fast connection   is the most desirable  for customers, and they will always prefer a stable mobile network.
Therefore, Telkom understands that 5G networks demand will increase in the future.
Therefore, Telkomsel has officially launched 5G services.
With the 5G network, the communication process would be smoother with the broader bandwidth for better and faster data communication.
In addition, the B2B line in the Mobile segment would improve by penetrating digital solutions such as Digital Advertising (MyADS Telkomsel), Big Data (Telkomsel MSight), and Internet of Things (Telkomsel IoT) to create cross-industry breakthroughs.
In the B2C line, Telkom, through Telkomsel, will develop digital products according to customer needs.
Telkomsel’s portfolio of digital services includes Digital Lifestyle (MAXstream, LangitMusik, Dunia Games), Mobile Financial Services (LinkAja), and Digital Banking (mBanking Telkomsel).
In the Consumer segment, the opportunities are from  the high-quality fixed broadband services competition due to the increasing demand for high-quality internet in line with the current trend of flexible working, online learning, and other activities such as e-commerce or digital entertainment.
Meanwhile, the penetration of fixed broadband services is still relatively low, around 15.7% of total households in Indonesia.
To accommodate the demands, Telkom focuses on increasing broadband service coverage for Indonesia and building the Mobile and Consumer segments synergy with the innovative development of fixed wireless products that can complement each other.
Telkom will focus on data center development in the  Enterprise segment because it has the high demand potential amid the rampant business digitization and digitalization in various sectors.
The digital services development influenced the increased demand, such as e-commerce and diverse other digital solutions.
In addition, data center development still has the potential for a relatively good profitability level in the market.
To support the development of the data center business, Telkom also focuses on services on it, namely cloud services and other IT service support that will anchor business digitization in various sectors.
In addition, through its subsidiary, Infomedia, the Ministry of SOEs assigned and trusted Telkom as the implementation entity for SOE Global Shared Service (GSS).
The program will present Shared Service Operation (SSO) services which Telkom  151 annual report 2021Mana GeMent DISC uSSIon anD anal YSISwill deliver on a B2B basis for all SOEs in Indonesia.
SSO is  needed to consolidate repetitive resources and streamline shared non-core work functions (such as finance, administration, personnel, procurement, et cetera) to have more transparent and efficient performance.
In the future, Telkom will sell the SSO business model, which the public can utilize.
TelkomGroup still focuses on improving the  telecommunications tower business, wholesale carrier hubbing, telecommunications services and networks, data centers, infrastructure managed services, and power solutions for network operators/telecommunication services and digital ecosystems in the Wholesale and International Business segment, both domestic and overseas.
In addition, the development of the Global Digital Hub, which provides direct broadband connectivity across Europe, Asia, and America, will be still developing.
It is supported by the Indonesia Global Gateway (IGG) submarine cable, which connects the SEA-ME-WE 5 with the SEA-US submarine cable of Telkom as an enabler.
It will be the main gateway for digital connectivity that brings domestic to global traffic, global to domestic traffic, and within countries (hubbing), both voice traffic and A2P (Application-to-person) SMS.
