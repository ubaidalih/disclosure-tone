Economic Overview Throughout 2023, the global economy endured various  challenges, ranging from escalating geopolitical  tensions that affected global supply and demand to  the dynamics of developed countries that resulted in a  global economic slowdown.
The United States has still been grappling with   above-target inflation and high interest rates that have  triggered a slowdown in the superpower’s economy.
Similarly, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is still  struggling to rebuild its economic strength after the  COVID-19 pandemic.
The World Bank has set a target of global economic  growth at 2.1% (2022: 3.3%) triggered by uncertain  geopolitical situations, high inflation, and rising interest  rates in many countries.
Meanwhile, the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) has a more optimistic target of 3%.
Amidst global economic slowdown, Indonesia was among  the countries that posted the highest economic growth  performance within ASEAN and the G20, according to  the Ministry of Finance.
Indonesia’s economy remained  resilient with growth of 5.05%, slightly slower than the  previous year’s 5.31%.
Domestic economic growth still shows significant  resilience in terms of household consumption, investment,  and exports.
Data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS)  revealed that household consumption, which accounts  for 53% of Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP),  grew by 4.82% in 2023, driven by an increase in the  minimum wage and government social assistance.
Meanwhile, the inflation rate in 2023 closed at  2.61%(year-on-year), much lower than inflation in  2022 which was 5.51%.
According to BPS, inflation in  2023 was the lowest in the last 20 years (excluding the  pandemic period in 2021), driven by a decrease in core  inflation.
In addition, the controlled inflation was also  driven by coordinated and structured efforts between the  Government and central bank Bank Indonesia to maintain  the inflation rate.
Industry Overview On a positive note, the domestic economy has fuelled  national energy demand, fuelled by higher levels of  mobility in society and industry.
However, the majority of  national energy sources still come from fossil fuels, namely  petroleum and coal.
The utilization of new and renewable energy (NRE) in the  national energy mix, such as for power generation, is still  not optimal due to its price, which is not yet competitive with  fossil fuels, given that Indonesia has not yet implemented  a carbon tax or tax imposed on the burning of fossil fuels.
In addition, the technology and supply chain of NRE have  not yet developed in Indonesia.
However, over the last few years the Government has  continued to develop large-scale NRE to reduce the  cost of generating NRE electricity so that it can be more  competitive.
According to records from the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), the realization  of the NRE mix for electricity generation until the end of  2023 is 13.1%, with a mix target of reaching 17-19% in  2025.
Data from the Ministry of EMR revealed that Indonesia’s  total electricity demand in 2021 is 257 terawatts per hour  (TWh).
Meanwhile, the potential for geothermal supply  in Indonesia reaches 23 gigawatts (GW), with the largest  resource areas on the islands of Java and Sumatra.
With such huge resource potential, geothermal is  becoming one of the mainstays of green energy for  the NRE mix of power generation in the country, and  certainly opens up great growth opportunities for PGE  in the future.
The Company’s Position in the National  Geothermal Industry Situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is second  only to the US in the largest geothermal reserves in the  world, with potential resources estimated at 23,060 MW  across Indonesia, from Sumatra to Papua.
According to data from the Ministry of Energy and  Mineral Resources (MEMR) published in the Handbook  of Energy & Economic Statistics of Indonesia 2022, out of  the total potential, 13,842 MW of which are identified  as reserves (probable, suspected, proven) with potential  for development, while 9,219 MW are speculative and  hypothetical resources.
Star Energy Geothermal Darajat II Ltd.
The utilization of geothermal energy in Indonesia  currently only reaches 2,417.73 MW through 18  Geothermal Power Plants (PLTP) across Indonesia, with  eight PLTPs owned by PGE.
As of the end of 2023, PGE has had six self-operated  geothermal working areas (WKP) that are already in  commercial operation with a total installed capacity of  672 MW, namely: Kamojang (235 MW), Ulubelu (220  MW), Lahendong (120 MW), as well as a 0.5 MW  binary plant for own use, Sibayak (12 MW), Karaha  (30 MW), and Lumut Balai (55 MW).
In addition, PGE is also working on two development  projects, namely Lumut Balai Unit 2 (55 MW) and   Hululais Units 1 and 2 (110 MW).
The other five fields  are in the exploration stage, namely Hululais Extension  – Prospect Bukit Daun, Seulawah, Kotamobagu,  Lahendong 7 and 8, and Way Ratai.
There are five fields operated through cooperation in  the form of a Joint Operation Contract (KOB), of which  four fields are already in commercial operation, namely  Gunung Salak (377 MW), Darajat (271 MW) and  Wayang-Rindu (227 MW ) operated by Star Energy  Geothermal Ltd.
, Sarulla (330 MW) operated by Sarulla  Operation Ltd.
, and one field in the exploration stage,  namely in Bedugul, Bali, operated by Bali Energy Ltd.

Geothermal has high flexibility in utilization because it  does not depend on climate or weather conditions.
In  general, the use of geothermal energy can be divided  into two, namely indirect use for geothermal power  plants (PLTP), and direct use for other activities.
Indirect Geothermal Utilization  Scheme Indirect utilization of geothermal energy for PLTP is carried  out by producing geothermal fluid from geothermal  resources (reservoirs), the hot steam of which is then  channeled to a turbine to drive a generator through  several stages: 1.
Well drilling is carried out in areas and/or areas  that have reservoirs with a depth of 700 - 3,000  meters. 2.
In steam dominated geothermal fields, the fluid  flowing from the well is only steam. 3.
In geothermal fields, water dominates, the fluid  flowing from the well is in the form of steam and hot  water (brine). 4.
Geothermal fluid is flowed using a pipe to a  separator to be phase separated into steam and  brine. 5.
The separated brine is injected back into the  reservoir via the injection well. 6.
The steam is channeled to a turbine to spin a  generator. 7.
The electricity produced by the generator is  channeled to the transformer to adjust the voltage,  then distributed to the PLN electricity network. 8.
Through the electricity network, electricity is  distributed to consumers around the power plant.

Direct Geothermal Utilization Scheme   Direct utilization includes the activities of the  geothermal utilization business directly without  converting the heat energy and/or fluid into other  types of energy for non-electric purposes.
There are  two ways to utilize geothermal heat directly by using  the energy visible on the earth’s surface as follows:   1.
Geothermal fluid flows through a pipe to a low  pressure separator.
Through this stage, the hot steam  and brine will separate.
Hot steam flows to the  turbine, while hot water from the separator flows to  the heat exchanger to heat the working fluid (water)  so that the temperature of the working fluid changes  to warm.
The warm water can then be channeled  and used directly for fisheries, pools or hot springs.
The cold water produced in this process will flow  back into rivers or underground to maintain balance.     2.
Geothermal fluid from the hot spring is channeled to  a heat exchanger to heat the working fluid (air) and  the temperature is adjusted until it becomes warm.
This warm air is channeled to warm the greenhouse  and dry agricultural and plantation products.
The cold  brine produced from this process will flow back into  the river or into the ground to maintain balance.

Business Segments Operated As stated in PGE’s 2023 Financial Statements audited  by KAP Purwantono, Sungkoro & Surja, in carrying out  operational activities, PGE divides its business segments  into two: a.
Own operations.
Joint Operation Contract (KOB) with PLN   The KOB Sales to PLN segment has an allocable  asset in the form of trade receivables.
As for  liabilities, those attributable are in the form of trade  payables.
Other assets and liabilities such as cash  and loans are managed centrally through the head  office.
PGE is a pioneer in the utilization and development of  geothermal energy in Indonesia.
The Company can be  positioned as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) that  conducts business activities to produce and sell products  in the form of geothermal steam and electricity.
Product  sales are carried out in the mechanism of Geothermal  Steam Sales and Purchase Agreement (PJBU), and  Electric Power Sales and Purchase Agreement (PJBL).
Electricity Equivalent Steam Production Overall, the Company’s electricity equivalent steam  production during 2023 reached 4,734.5 GWh, or  4.66% of the 2023 RKAP target of 4,524 GWh.
The realization of steam production equivalent to electricity in the Kamojang Area in 2023 reached 1,694  GWh, or 106.40% of the RKAP target of 1,592 GWh, up by 102 GWh, or 0.89% from 2022 which was  1,679 GWh.
This achievement was possible thanks to the acceleration of Turnaround Maintenance work on  PLTP Unit 5 from a planned 25 days to 1 1 days, acceleration of Simple Inspection work on PLTP Unit 2 from a  planned 24 days to 21 days, as well as very good production absorption at PLTP Unit 1 and 5.
The realization of steam production equivalent to electricity in the Lahendong Area in 2023 reached 868.8  GWh, or 105.58% of the RKAP target of 823 GWh, and an increase of 46 GWh, or 0.57% from 2022  of 864 GWh.
The factors driving the increase were due to increased availability factors, acceleration of  outage maintenance work at PLTP Lahendong units 5 & 6 from 8 days to 5 days, acceleration of Turn Around  Maintenance activities at PLTP Lahendong unit 1 from 40 days to 34 days and PLTP Lahendong unit 2 from  40 days to 30 days.
The realization of steam production equivalent to electricity in the Ulubelu Area in 2023 reached 1,606.0  GWh, or 101.53% of the RKAP target of 1,582 GWh, and an increase of 53 GWh, or 3.41% from 2022 of  1,553 GWh.
This is due to the additional capacity of 20 MW from the completion of the SAGS Debottlenecking  Project and accelerated completion of Turn Around Maintenance PLTP Ulubelu unit 4 which was completed  within 16 days from the initial plan of 21 days.
The realization of steam production equivalent to electricity in the Karaha Area in 2023 reached 96.6 GWh,  or 92.53% of the RKAP of 104,489 GWh, due to the expected average generation capacity not being  achieved.
However, actual production in 2023 increased by 12.3 GWh, or 14.75% from 2022 of 84.25  GWh.
The increase in production in the Karaha area occurred because the Company succeeded in reducing  the unplanned shutdown rate from 2.5% to 0.7%.
In addition, PGE has successfully completed the construction  of landslide disaster prevention infrastructure in the operational area of the Karaha area.
The realization of steam production equivalent to electricity in the Lumut Balai Area in 2023 reached 469.30  GWh, or the equivalent of 1 1 1.07% of the RKAP of 422.54 GWh, an increase of 20.8 GWh, or 4.63% from  2022 which was 448. 5 GWH.
The increase was driven by increasing demand for electricity (high demand)  on the main electricity network on the island of Sumatra.
PLTP Units I and II belonging to PT Dizamatra Powerindo are not operating because the main equipment is in  poor condition and is not suitable for operation.
This caused PLTP repairs to be halted through PT Dizamatra  Powerindo letter No.059/DP-SBY/III/2016.
Based on these conditions, PT Pertamina (Persero) on October 30,  2017 sent a Request for Legal Opinion to the Attorney General Office of the Republic of Indonesia via Letter  No. 690/ M00000/2017-S0, related to the issue of implementing the Steam Sales Contract (SSC) or Steam  Sale and Purchase Agreement with PT Dizamatra Powerindo.
This request was submitted because until now the  Company cannot utilize the steam produced by the Sibayak Area, because according to the SSC the steam  can only be sold to PT Dizamatra Powerindo. 199 elevate Laporan Tahunan 2023  Annual ReportAnalisa Dan Pembahasan Manajemen   Managementdiscussion And Analysis Pendapatan dan Profitabilitas Segmen  Perseroan memperoleh pendapatan usaha melalui:  1.
Segment Revenue and Profitability The Company derives its operating revenues through: 1.
The Company’s own operations, which consist of  the sale of electricity and steam generated at the  PLTP and steam wells to PLN and other IPPs based  on various ESCs and PPAs signed by the Company.   2.
Production allowances obtained from KOB  Contractors who have contracts with the Company  to operate in the Company’s WKP.
The amount of  production allowance is typically 4% of the KOB  Contractor’s net operating revenue.
However,  specifically for the operations carried out by Star  Energy Darajat, the value is only 2.66% of net  operating revenue.
Operating Revenue from steam and electricity production  segment for 2023 was recorded at USD406,288  thousand, an increase of USD20,220 thousand,  or 5.24% from 2022 which reached USD386,068  thousand.
To ensure the availability of geothermal steam to fulfill  sales and purchase contracts and sustainable business,  the Company continues to conduct exploration and  development activities in all WKPs in accordance with  the business strategy in the Company’s Work Plan and  Budget (RKAP) and the Company’s Long Term Plan  (RJPP).
Exploration activities consist of geoscience studies  (geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and geomatics),  starting from surveying, processing, modeling, analysis,  evaluation, interpretation of geoscience data, and  exploration drilling until a project is ready to produce  electricity .
In the reporting period, as a follow-up on the  determination of the auction winner for the Way Ratai  WKP in accordance with the Decree of the Minister  of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of  Indonesia Number 118.

Beberapa tantangan yang harus dihadapi dalam  mengembangkan energi geotermal diantaranya adalah  lokasi pengembangan yang spesifik, risiko dan biaya  investasi yang tinggi, serta isu distribusi energiAligned with the Government's optimism regarding  Indonesia's economic growth potential reaching 5.2% in  2024, the Company is confident in achieving business  growth bolstered by the Government's commitment  to continually enhancing the utilization of New and  Renewable Energy in the national energy mix.
Globally, New and Renewable Energy has seen a  growth of 9%, with geothermal energy experiencing  a 6% growth over the past 7 years.
This growth is  influenced by several interrelated factors, including:   1.
Government mandates focusing on the  implementation of Environmental, Social &  Governance (ESG) principles in renewable energy  development. 2.
Decreasing costs of renewable energy attributed  to significant advancements in research and  development. 3.
Incentives and new regulations supporting  renewable energy initiatives. 4.
Advancements in the value chain in the renewable  energy sector.
Supported by the potential of geothermal resources in  Indonesia that reached 23 gigawatts (GW), geothermal  will become one of the flagship green energies for the  renewable energy mix of power plants in the country  that will support national energy security towards the  target of Net Zero Emission (NZE) by 2060.
To date,  the largest geothermal industry growth is in Asia with  a contribution of 37%, followed by North America at  24% and Eurasia at 22%.
Some of the challenges that  must be faced in developing geothermal energy include  specific development locations, high investment risks and  costs, and energy distribution issues.   247 elevate Laporan Tahunan 2023  Annual ReportAnalisa Dan Pembahasan Manajemen   Managementdiscussion And Analysis Analisa situasi industri geotermal domestik dilakukan  dengan mempertimbangkan indikator sebagai berikut:  1.
PGE The domestic geothermal industry situation was analyzed  by considering the following indicators: 1.
Macroeconomics The growth trend of renewable energy globally  is supported by the conditions and situation of  the geothermal industry in Indonesia.
In terms of  macroeconomics, Indonesia is projected to grow  with a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of  5% until 2028.
The level of energy consumption  in Indonesia is also predicted to increase by  3% by 2028, indicating that the proportion  of energy needs in Indonesia is increasing   2.
Regulations The Indonesian Government actively supports  the development of geothermal energy  by implementing several regulations that  encourage the acceleration of renewable  energy utilization, including geothermal energy.   3.
Politics The development of the geothermal industry in  Indonesia is also influenced by political situation  in the country.
Currently, the Government is  evaluating the demand for renewable energy  imports from abroad before granting geothermal  export licenses, so this is a particular challenge for  PGE.
Beyond this, there is potential for renewable  energy development with the release of the  Golden Indonesia 2045 roadmap which states that  Indonesia has a net zero emission target by 2060  with four main targets that must be met by 2045.   4.
Geothermal Technology There is potential for the development of geothermal  technology in Indonesia with the opportunity  to export electricity abroad.
PGE can make the most of this opportunity to export  to these countries using subsea transmission.
The global geothermal industry situation was analyzed  by three regions, namely the western ring of fire, great  rift valley, and eastern ring of fire.
Countries in the world  that contribute to the development of the geothermal  industry in addition to Indonesia, among others: USA,  New Zealand, Kenya, Türkiye, the Philippines, and  Mexico.
Among these countries, there is still geothermal  energy potential that is still not fully utilized.
This  situation is an opportunity for the Company to accelerate  business growth through Merger and Acquisition (M&A).
In addition to business development in the geothermal  industry, geothermal derivative products are currently  also developing, including green hydrogen, methanol,  and silica.
The development of geothermal derivative  products is expected to become a new source of revenue  for the Company in the future.
The Company’s Work Plan and Budget (RKAP) for the  financial year 2023 was determined based on the  Circular Shareholders’ Resolution on the Company’s  Work Plan and Budget (RKAP) Year 2023, which also  contains performance targets for the financial year 2023.
Comparison of Financial Performance  Between the Initial Target of Fiscal  Year 2023 and the Achieved Results  (Realization), as well as its Comparison  with the Realization of Fiscal Year  2022      Analysis of Achievement of Revenue  and Profit Realization The Company’s operating revenue for 2023 was realized  at USD406,288 or 106.9% of the RKAP, which was mainly  influenced by an increase in own operating income due  to higher than targeted electricity production and high  realization of production allowances.
In addition, there  was a realization of carbon credit sales to PT Pertamina  Power Indonesia.
The Company’s Net Profit for 2023 increased year-on- year (YoY) driven by foreign exchange gain from the  strengthening of the United States Dollar (USD) against  the Japanese Yen.
The realization of interest income in  2023 also led to an increase in the Company’s Net Profit  for the financial year 2023. 250elevate Laporan Tahunan 2023  Annual ReportAnalisa Dan Pembahasan Manajemen   Managementdiscussion And Analysis 2023 2022 Uraian   Description RKAP   (USD Ribu)   (USD thousand)Realisasi   (USD Ribu) Realization   (USD Thousand)% RKAPRealisasi   (USD Ribu) Realization   (USD Thousand) Pendapatan Usaha | Operating Revenue 380.831 406.288 106,90% 386.068 Beban Usaha | Operating Expenses (185.479) (178.977) 99,00% (173.208) Laba Usaha | Operating Profit 195.352 265.176 135.74% 209.583 EBITDA 353.976 332.416 99.90% 308.087 Perbandingan Target dan Realisasi  Penjualan  Analisa Pencapaian Penjualan Pencapaian penjualan pada tahun 2023 terealisasi  USD386.492,30 atau 104,76% dari RKAP  (USD368.943,30).

Comparison of Production Target and  Realization Analysis of Achievement of Production  Realization The Company’s production throughout 2023 was  realized at 4,734.57 GWh or 104.66% of the RKAP.
This was mainly supported by the acceleration of  maintenance activities in almost all working areas which  ran faster than planned, as well as the achievement  of the production optimization program in the Karaha  and Lumut Balai areas.
In addition, the Ulubelu PLTP  debottlenecking program was also successfully realized  and had a direct impact on increasing production  volumes in the area.
Di tahun 2024, Perseroan menetapkan Rencana Kerja  Anggaran Perusahaan 2024 sebagai berikut:The Ministry of Finance is optimistic that Indonesia’s  economy in 2024 will grow at 5.2%, an increase  from 5.05% in 2023, supported by the level of public  consumption, especially of local products, which can  help drive the national economy.

The geothermal production achievement until December  2023 marked an impressive outcome with 4,734.57  GWh, surpassing the 2023 RKAP by 4.66%.
This success  was propelled by efficiency in geothermal power plant  maintenance activities, which were completed ahead  of schedule, along with some maintenance plans that  were not executed during the year.
Additionally, optimal  operations and a high load factor in the Lumut Balai  Area exceeding expectations at 6.72% contributed  to surpassing the set targets.
However, the realization  of KURS/Workover fell below target due to changes  in well priorities and the technical scope of work.
To achieve the targets for the coming year, the  following achievement strategies are being pursued:   1.
Ensuring the timely execution of programs according  to the planned schedule. 2.
Ensuring that program implementation budgets do  not exceed the budget plan. 3.
Ensuring that the provided work and materials  adhere to the specified project documentation.   4.
Ensuring that program deliverables/returns align  with objectives. 5.
The net profit realization of PGE as of December 2023  exceeded expectations, with an increase of 9% compared  to the 2023 RKAP target.
Contributing factors include  higher-than-anticipated electricity production, an increase  in production allowance, and income from carbon credit  sales.
