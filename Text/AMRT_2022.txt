The Covid-19 pandemic has brought changes to numerous things.
The impact has been felt both in the economy and public consumption behavior in general.
The social restrictions imposed by the government have an impact on increasingly difficult economic conditions due to the disruptions of economic activity which affects people’s purchasing power.
The decline in people’s purchasing power and mobility restrictions will undoubtedly affect the development of the retail business, so companies must be able to adjust their business strategy.
The Indonesian Retail Business Association (Aprindo)  assesses that sales performance growth for retail companies in Indonesia will improve in 2023 in line with the government’s success in dealing with the surge in Covid-19.

The government has also revoked the PPKM (Community Activities Restrictions Enforcement) policy at the end of 2022.
That way, people will be provided with more mobility, increasing public consumption activities.
In the future, people’s spending patterns will shift from only buying basic necessities to shopping for secondary needs.
