Analysis of Global and National Economic  Conditions The global economic growth was slowing down in 2023.
This was caused by an increasing uncertainty and widening  growth gap between countries.
While most countries were  still focused on efforts to recover the economy from the  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic through monetary and fiscal  policies, the global economy was faced with challenges with  political turmoil and geopolitical conflicts, including conflicts  and dynamics between large countries.
In addition, high inflation in many countries has forced  changes in monetary policy, such as raising interest rates,  including maintaining the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) at a  high level for a longer period of time (higher for longer).
The increase in global interest rates is expected to be  followed by an increase in the yield on long-term tenor  bonds in developed countries, especially United States (US)  government bonds due to increased government financing  needs and long-term risk premiums (term-premia).
This  development triggered an outflow of foreign capital from  Emerging Markets to developed countries and encouraged  a significant strengthening of the US dollar against various  world currencies.
On the other hand, the uncertainty of global financial  market, which is influenced by various factors including  changes in economic policies and political uncertainty, adds  complexity to the existing economic scenario.
The dynamics  of international trade are also shifting, with trade tensions  and revisions to trade agreements affecting global economic  flows.
Based on the World Economic Outlook report on January  2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate global  economic growth in 2023 amounted to 3.1% and projected  will grow flat at 3.1% in 2024.
This estimation is an increase  compared to projection published in October 2023 of 3.0%,  in line with improving world economic conditions at the end  of 2023.
The US economy in 2023 grew quite strongly,  mainly supported by household consumption and the service  sector, while China was experiencing a slowdown influenced  by weakening consumption and crisis in the property sector.
Amid the global economic conditions which are experiencing  a slowdown Indonesia’s economy can still grow quite strongly.
Based on data from the Statistics Indonesia, Indonesia’s  economic growth in 2023 was recorded at 5.05% and  experienced a slight decline than the previous year’s 5.31%.
The strong economic growth was supported by solid domestic  demand.
Household consumption grew by 4.82%, in line with  the continued increase in mobility, stable people’s purchasing  power, and consumer confidence which remains high.
This is due to the successful attempt made by the government  and Bank Indonesia (BI) in maintaining the inflation rate at a  low level.
Based on BPS data, national inflation in 2023 was  recorded at 2.61%, much lower than the previous year’s 5.51%.
And supported by BI’s policy of increasing the benchmark  interest rate or BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) to 6.0%  from the position at the end of last year of 5.5%, to ensure  core inflation is maintained.
Indonesia’s economic growth was also supported by export  performance which was quite good, although lower than the  previous year.
Indonesia’s export value in 2023 was recorded  at USD258.82 billion, slightly below the 2022 export  achievement of USD291.90 billion.
The slowdown in export  value is in line with the moderation in prices of Indonesia’s  leading commodities, such as palm oil and coal.
Apart from  that, the economic slowdown in a number of Indonesia’s main  trading partner countries also contributed to the slowdown in  the value of Indonesia’s exports.
This achievement shows that Indonesia’s  trade performance is maintained amidst the global economic  slowdown.
Despite achieving fairly good economic growth in 2023,  Indonesia must remain careful in facing conditions in 2024.
The IMF projects that the Indonesian economy will grow  stably at the level of 5.0% in 2024.
The IMF’s projection of  Indonesia’s economic growth is based on Indonesia’s fiscal  and monetary policy assumptions.
However, the Indonesian  economy will be overshadowed by a number of problems at  the global level, such as geopolitical conflicts and pressure  on commodity prices.
Moreover, in 2024, Indonesia will also organize a democracy  party and elect a national leader.
This will also have an  influence on the direction of the national economy, both in  2024 and beyond.
Coal Industry Analysis In 2023, world and national coal market condition experienced  several important dynamics.
First, a sharp decline in the world  coal price index, especially ICE Newcastle, compared to the  previous year.
This phenomenon can also be seen in the coal  price indices used in Indonesia, such as the HBA (Reference  Coal Price) and ICI (Indonesia Coal Index), which following  the same weakening trend.
This decline can be linked to  various factors, including changes in global energy policy,  increased utilization of renewable energy, and a possible  global economic slowdown affecting coal demand.
ICE Newcastle Tahun 2023 ICE Newcastle in 2023 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 Jan-23 Feb-23 Mar-23 Apr-23 Mei-23 Jun-23 Jul-23 Agu-23 Sep-23 Okt-23 Nov-23 Des-230377,56 146,85143,23 123,25135,05 166,82 156,84400 227,92 182,23 187,46 129,28 133,04 Tanggung Jawab Sosial Perusahaan Corporate Social  ResponsibilityReferensi Silang OJK & ARA OJK & ARA Cross-ReferenceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTata Kelola Perusahaan Good Corporate Governance191 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam TbkOn the other hand, from a supply-demand perspective,  Indonesia remains the number one coal exporter in the world.
This shows that despite the decline in prices, Indonesia’s  position in the global coal market remains strong.
Furthermore, coal production growth in Indonesia shows an  upward trend compared to 2022.
This increase indicates  that the Indonesian coal sector still has a large production  capacity and is able to meet demand, both domestic and  international.
Overall, despite the decline in prices on the  global market, Indonesia’s strength as a major exporter and  increased production are important factors shaping coal  market conditions in 2023.

The  national coal production in 2023 was realized at 771,04 million  tonnes, or reaching 111.01% of the target of 694.50 million tonnes.
With total coal production of 771,04 million tons, this set a  new record in national coal production which were previously  reaching 685.80 million tons in 2022.
The total production in  2023, is expected to meet the domestic market’s coal needs  of 344.53 million tons, the export market is 406.67 million  tons, and the remaining 71.06 million is intended for DMO.
However, in 2023, the coal industry faced challenges with the  existence of Government Regulation (PP) Number 26 of 2022  concerning Types and Tariffs for Types of Non-Tax State  Revenue (PNBP) which has been in effect since September  2022.
In this PP, the new coal royalty tariff is regulated at up  to 13.5% from the original price of only 7% of the price (for  reference, HBA equal to or greater than US$ 90 per ton).
This  brought an impact on increasing the royalty fees in the coal  industry.
Perusahaan saat ini telah memperbarui kerangka Company Strategy and Strategic Policy As one of the largest coal producers in Indonesia, PTBA is  aware of the increasing challenges the coal industry faces in  the future.
The energy transition has reduced the prospects  for using coal in the long term but, at the same time, has  opened up new business development opportunities for the  Company, such as new and renewable energy businesses  and other green businesses.
Sustainability issues are an essential part that must be  integrated into the Company’s business strategy to ensure  the long-term sustainability of the Company’s business and  increase added value for stakeholders in the future.
The Company is currently focusing on optimizing its existing  resources and improving capabilities to support its business  transformation and achieve the above goals.
The Company’s strategic policies that are in line with the  Company’s vision are contained in the Company’s long- term plan (RJPP), which is then revealed in the Company’s  work plan and budget (WP&B) each year.
Groundbreaking Train Loading Station (TLS) dan Coal Handling Facility (CHF) 6 dan 7    Tanjung Enim, 30 Desember 2023 Groundbreaking of the Train Loading Station (TLS) and Coal Handling Facility (CHF) 6 and 7   Tanjung Enim, December 30, 2023 consists of 4 (four) business pillars, namely: (1) Mining, (2)  Logistics, Infrastructure, and Trading, (3) Energy, Utilities, and  Downstream, and (4) Green Business.
As for 2023, several activities within the framework of the  4 (four) pillars include: 1.
Mining Pillar In the mining sector, the company strives to safeguard  existing reserves and control reserves by mapping  economic mining potentials.
The company also increased  its production to the highest figure in its history.
The  company also encourages increased production of its  subsidiary, namely PT Internasional Prima Coal, which  operates in East Kalimantan.
Operationally, the company  also continues to optimize mining, as demonstrated  by the success of reducing the stripping ratio to 6.24 x  (times) from the target of 6.31 x (times).
Apart from that,  the company is also continuously active in carrying out  operational cost efficiency and digitalization efforts in end- to-end business processes through the CISEA application. 2.
Logistics, Infrastructure, and Trading Pillar Increasing coal transportation capacity is one of the  main priorities for the Company.
In 2023, the Company  successfully carried out the groundbreaking of the Train  Loading Station (TLS) and Coal Handling Facility (CHF) 6  and 7 in Tanjung Enim on December 30, 2023.
This TLS  groundbreaking was a part of a series of developing coal  transportation capacity via the Tanjung Enim-Keramasan  railway with the potential to increase transportation  capacity by 20 million tons per year.
This project is in  collaboration with the state-owned railway company, PT  KAI, which is expected to start commercial operations in  2025.
Energy, Utility and Downstream pillars The company continues to try to diversify its business  portfolio, including by exploring the development of  energy, utilities, and coal downstream businesses.
In the  energy business, the company is still developing its coal- based generating business with more environmentally  friendly technology and is aggressively exploring the  development of new and renewable energy businesses.
In 2023, CFPP Sumsel-8, with a capacity of 2x620 MW,  will be under the entity PT Huadian Bukit Asam Power  (HBAP), which is a joint venture company between  PTBA and China Huadian Hong Kong Co.
(CHDHK)  successfully reached the Commercial Operation Date  (COD) stage on October 7, 2023.
Sumsel-8 CFPP is the  enormous mine mouth CFPP in Southeast Asia, and it  is one of the National Strategic Projects, equipped with  efficient and supercritical technology and environmentally  friendly.
Apart from that, Sumsel-8 CFPP also applies Flue  Gas Desulfurization (FGD) technology to reduce exhaust  gas emissions.
Apart from reducing sulfur dioxide from  exhaust emissions from coal-fired power plants, this FGD  technology can also produce gypsum as a product that  can be used as a construction material.
It is estimated  that Sumsel-8 CFPP will utilize low CV coal from PTBA,  amounting to 4 to 5 million tons annually.
The company and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies  continue to strive for business expansion in other energy  business value chains.
The company continues its coal downstream program as  part of the state’s strategic mandate while prioritizing each  project’s economics.
The company continues to explore  collaboration with technology owners and researchers to  develop coal derivative products that have the potential to  be commercialized in the long term.
One of the initiatives  is the company’s collaboration with the National Research  & Innovation Agency (BRIN).
On October 2, 2023, the  company signed a Memorandum of Understanding  with BRIN to conduct research and development, study  energy technology and coal-based industry, and new  and renewable energy.
Several projects currently in  the company’s pipeline include Coal to DME, Coalite to  Artificial Graphite, and Coal to MEG. 4.
Green Business Pillar The company is also working to expand its portfolio into  green businesses.
This business pillar is a new pillar for  the company, and it is believed to continue to develop in  the future.
In 2023, the company carried out a soft launch  of another form of reclamation to develop red calliandra  cultivation in Tanjung Enim.
The red calliandra will be  processed into wood pellets and used as coal-mixed  fuel (co-firing) at the CFPP.
The company is also actively  exploring carbon projects that can not only support the  company’s future decarbonization efforts but can also be  commercialized to provide added value.
Marketing Strategy In 2023, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued  a policy of assigning coal companies, including PTBA, to  fulfill domestic supplies to the CFPP and also the cement and  fertilizer industry.
Facing this policy, the company strived to  fulfill the task for the domestic market while optimizing sales  for the export market.
For the export market in 2023, the  company exported coal to the main seaborne coal markets  in East Asia and South Asia, such as China, South Korea, and  India, as well as Southeast Asian markets which experienced  increased demand in 2023, such as Vietnam, Thailand, and  Cambodia.
In 2024, the government re-assist the Company to meet  domestic supplies, especially for electrical and non-electrical  industries such as cement and fertilizer.
The company will  continue to optimize domestic and export sales in order to  achieve sales and revenue targets.
Moreover, PTBA is also  seeking sales through alternative transportation routes which  can open up opportunities to increase sales and income.

Based on Directors’ Decree No. 050/0100/2022 concerning  PT Bukit Asam Tbk Trademarks and Coal Specifications, the  Company has various types of coal products according to the  following quality levels: Tanggung Jawab Sosial Perusahaan Corporate Social  ResponsibilityReferensi Silang OJK & ARA OJK & ARA Cross-ReferenceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTata Kelola Perusahaan Good Corporate Governance203 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam TbkCoal Segment Challenges and Strategy Throughout 2023, PTBA encountered several significant  challenges in the coal segment which have a direct impact  on the company’s financial performance.
One of the main  challenges faced is the weakening of the coal price index,  which includes the Newcastle Index, Reference Coal Price,  and Indonesia Coal Index (ICI).
This decrease in the price  index resulted in a decrease in the average sales price of  coal, which led to a decrease in company revenue.
In addition,  there was an increase in total costs which was driven by  several factors including increases in production volume,  transportation, sales and changes in regulations related to  royalties.
The weakening coal price index and rising costs  certainly affect of PTBA’s profit margin.
The Company is committed to implementing effective  strategies, including operational efficiency, revenue  diversification, and innovation in product development.
The  Company actively monitors market dynamics and proactively  adjusts business strategies to minimize negative impacts and  maximize future growth potential.
Coal Segment Productivity The Company’s total coal production in 2023 was amounted  at 41.94 million tons, an increase of 4.81 million tons or 12.94%  compared to 2022 of 37.14 million tons.
The coal production  came from the Company’s mining units located in several  locations, namely the Tanjung Enim Mining Unit (UPTE)  located in the Air Laya Mine area, Muara Tiga Besar (MTB),  Banko West and Central Banko, as well as 1 (one) mining  unit located in East Kalimantan Province, operated by the  Company’s subsidiary, namely PT Internasional Prima Coal.
The increase in coal production and purchasing in 2023 goes  hand in hand with the opening of new mining land in Banko  Tengah and the purchase of coal by a subsidiary, namely PT  BAP.
This increase is set to support sales which are expected  to increase the Company’s income.
The following is the total coal production and purchasing  recorded by the Company in the last 5 (five) years.
Ikhtisar Keuangan Financial HighlightLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company Profile204 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam Tbk Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisIn line with the increase in total coal production and  purchasing, the volume of coal transportation has also  increased.
In 2023, the total volume of coal transportation  was recorded at 32.42 million tons, an increase of 12,52%,  compared to 2022 which reached 28.81 million tons.

Meanwhile, the volume of  coal transportation to Kertapati was recorded at 6.99 million  tons in 2023, an increase of 29,44% compared to 2022 with  5.40 million tons.
The following is the total volume of coal  transportation to Tarahan and Kertapati in the last 5 (five)  years.
The company collaborates with PT KAI, to transport coal  from the mining site to the Company’s port and barging port  locations in Kertapati, Palembang and Tarahan, Lampung.
Meanwhile, in terms of coal sales volume in 2023, the  Company has recorded coal sales with a total volume of  36.97 million tons, an increase of 17% compared to 2022 with  31.65 million tons.
This increase is in line with the increase  in domestic coal demand and the company’s success in  penetrating new markets.
Below is the total volume of domestic and export of coal  sales in the past 5 (five) years.
From the total coal sales volume in 2023, domestic sales  were recorded at 21.40 million tons, an increase of 11.64%,  in 2023, compared to 19.17 million tons in 2022.
Meanwhile,  export sales were recorded at 15.57 million tons, an increase  of 24.74% compared to 12.48 million tons in 2022.
This  increase was caused by increasing demand for coal, both  domestic and export.
Revenue and Profitability Segment In line with the downward trend in coal prices at the global  market in 2023, the revenue obtained by the Company from  the coal segment also decreased to Rp37.97 trillion, or down  9,80% from the previous year of Rp42.10 trillion.
This also  resulted in a decrease in profit for the year from the coal  segment to Rp5.41 trillion, or down 53.12% from the previous  year of Rp11.55 trillion.
Other Segments In accordance with PTBA’s Notes to Financial Reports (CALK),  the Company has other segments as follows: 1.
Holding Activities PTBA’s holding segment is run by three main companies,  both strategic holding and operational holding.
The three  subsidiaries are as follows: a.
Power Plant Subholding is run by PT Bukit Energi  Investama (PT BEI).
PT BEI is responsible to manage  the subsidiary called PT Bukit Energi Service Terpadu  (PT BEST) which operates in the Operation and  Maintenance (O&M) services sector.
Apart from being  a holding company, PT BEI also continues to carry out  operational activities, especially in new and renewable  energy (NRE), such as Bali-Mandara Toll Road SPPP in  collaboration with PT Jasa Marga (Persero) and Rooftop  SPPP at Soekarno Hatta Airport in collaboration with  PT Angkasa Pura (Persero) II.
The Ports and Water Transportation Subholding is run by  PT Bukit Asam Prima (PT BAP).
PT BAP has the following  subsidiaries: (a) PT Bukit Prima Bahari (PT BPB) which is  engaged in Sea Transportation, (b) PT Pelabuhan Bukit  Prima (PT PBP) which is engaged in Port Maintenance  Services, and (c) PT Penajam Internasional Terminal  which is engaged in Dock Maintenance Services (PT  PIT).
In addition to the business activities of managing  subsidiaries, PT BAP itself also conducts coal trading  activities.
The other subholding is run by PT Bukit Multi Investama  (PT BMI) which manages the following subsidiaries: (a)  PT Satria Bahana Sarana (PT SBS) which is engaged  in mining service contractor, (b) PT Bukit Asam Medika  (PT BAM) which is engaged in health services, (c) PT  Bumi Sawindo Permai (PT BSP) which is engaged in  plantation, and (d) PT Bukit Multi Properti (PT BMP)  which is engaged in asset and property management. 2.
Contractor Services This segment is run by PTBA affiliate, namely   PT SBS.
PT SBS operates in the mining services business  focusing in Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra, mainly to  support PTBA coal production. 3.
Power Plants The power generation segment activities are carried out  by PTBA affiliates, namely PT Bukit Pembangkit Innovative  (PT BPI) and PT Huadian Bukit Asam Power (PT HBAP).
PT BPI has been operating commercially since 2015  with a capacity of 2x110 MW nett located in Lahat, South  Sumatra.
Meanwhile, PT HBAP is planned to operate  commercially in 2023 with a capacity of 2x660 MW and  becomes the largest mine mouth CFPP in Indonesia.
Apart from electricity generation, PTBA through PT Bukit  Energi Service Terpadu (PT BEST) also takes part in the  operational and maintenance (O&M) services business.
PT  BEST is responsible to carry out O&M activities at the CFPP  owned by PTBA in Tanjung Enim and Tarahan Lampung, as  well as managing several other CFPP in Sumatra. 4.
Briquette Management The briquette management is carried out by PTBA through  the Briquette Business Unit located in Tanjung Enim and  Tarahan Lampung. 5.
Plantation The PTBA business group also has an oil palm plantation  segment which is owned directly by Bukit Asam’s affiliate,  namely PT Bumi Sawindo Permai (PT BSP).
PT BSP  manages oil palm land located in Tanjung Agung, Muara  Enim, South Sumatra. 6.
Health Services To support the health of PTBA employees in particular  and PTBA partners in Tanjung Enim, PTBA established PT  Bukit Asam Medika (PT BAM), which manages the PTBA  Hospital and several clinics in Tanjung Enim. 7.
Port Services and Water Transportation This business is run by three PTBA affiliates, namely PT  BPB, PT PBP, and PT PIT.
Other Segment Challenges and Strategies PTBA has other business segments outside coal mining, with  each of them were faced with challenges and opportunities  in 2023.
In the mining contractor services segment, PT SBS  succeeded in increasing its contribution by 10% to PTBA’s coal  production achievements compared to the previous year,  with contributions in 2023 amounted to 18% of PTBA’s total  production, or the equivalent of 7.5 million tons.
This growth  shows the important role of PT SBS in supporting PTBA’s  production performance achievements, although it also  faced challenges in maintaining and improving operational  efficiency in the future.
In the power generation segment, PTBA also experienced  several challenges.
PT BPI is facing a decline in performance,  especially due to increased maintenance hours at PLTU  Banjarsari.
In addition, PT HBAP experienced a delay in the  Commercial Operation Date (COD) until October 7, 2023,  which hampered the company’s ability to optimize profit  absorption.
These challenges required strategies focusing  on improving operational efficiency and better managing  maintenance schedules to reduce downtime.
The plantation segment through PT BSP was also facing  a decline in financial performance caused by the decline  in Crude Palm Oil (CPO) prices, which brought a negative  impact on the average sales price of fresh fruit bunches  (FFB).
Strategies to overcome these challenges involve  exploring diversification of plantation products and improving  operational efficiency to reduce production costs.
Lastly, in the water transportation and port services segment,  PT BPB, PT PBP, and PT PIT experienced an increase in  performance in line with the increase in PTBA sales volume.
PT BAP, as the parent of the three companies, also contributed  to the trading business by purchasing 0.19 million tons of  High CV coal in 2023.
The strategy in this segment focuses  on expanding and increasing port infrastructure capacity to  support increasing coal sales volumes and diversifying the  portfolio of logistics service destinations.
With an integrated and strategic approach to other business  segments, PTBA seeks to overcome existing challenges  and take advantage of every opportunity for growth and  performance improvement in the future, especially from the  contribution of other business segments.

Ability to Pay Debts The Company is committed to fulfilling creditors’ rights by  making loan principal and interest payments on time.
For this  reason, the Company manages liquidity and monitors the  due date for principal and interest payments on loans.
The Company’s ability to fulfill all obligations, both short- term and long-term obligations, is measured through liquidity  ratios and solvency ratios.
Where the liquidity ratio is used  to measure the Company’s ability to pay off short-term  obligations and the solvency ratio is used to measure the  Company’s ability to fulfill all its obligations, both short-term  and long-term obligations.
The current ratio is a comparison between  the Company’s current assets and the Company’s short- term liabilities.
Meanwhile, the cash ratio is calculated based  on a comparison between the Company’s cash and cash  equivalents and the Company’s short-term liabilities.
The Company’s ability to pay short-term debt, which is  measured based on the liquidity ratio and the comparison in  the last 2 (two) years, is as described below: Liquidity Ratio Based on the table, the Company’s current ratio in 2023 was  recorded at 151.97%, experiencing a decrease compared to  the previous year of 228.30%.
Meanwhile, the Company’s  cash ratio in 2023 was recorded at 41.52%, experiencing a  decrease compared to the previous year of 65.69%.
This  shows that the Company still has the ability to meet its short- term obligations.
Company’s Ability to Pay Short-term and Long-term  Debt PTBA uses the solvency ratio to measure the Company’s  ability to meet its short-term and long-term obligations, which  are due.
The solvency ratio consists of the liabilities to equity  ratio or Debt to Equity Ratio (DER), as well as the liabilities to  assets ratio or Debt to Asset Ratio (DAR).
The Company’s ability to pay short-term debt and long-term  debt, which is measured based on the solvency ratio and the  comparison in the last 2 (two) years, is as described below: Tanggung Jawab Sosial Perusahaan Corporate Social  ResponsibilityReferensi Silang OJK & ARA OJK & ARA Cross-ReferenceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTata Kelola Perusahaan Good Corporate Governance227 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam TbkSolvency Ratio Based on the table, the liability to equity ratio or Debt  to Equity Ratio (DER) in 2023 was recorded at 79.77%,  experiencing an increase compared to the previous year of  56.87%.
Meanwhile, the liability to asset ratio or Debt to Asset  Ratio (DAR) in 2023 was recorded at 44.37%, experiencing  an increase compared to the previous year of 36.25%.
The  changes that occurred in the Company’s solvency ratio in  2023 compared to 2022, indicate that the Company’s ability  to fulfill long-term obligations has improved.
Receivables Collectability Rate The rate of collectability of receivables is the Company’s  ability to collect its receivables, which can be measured  based on calculating the collection period.
This collection  period is influenced by the amount of the Company’s trade  receivables and the amount of the Company’s revenue.
In  principle, the Company always tries to reduce the amount of  trade receivables and maintain the level of collectability of its  receivables.
The following is the collectability level of the Company’s  receivables as measured based on the collection period in  2023 compared to 2022: Receivables Collectability Rate Based on the table above, the collectability level of receivables  in 2023 is 38 days, different from the previous year, which  was 32 days.
This shows that the Company is trying to reduce  the amount of trade receivables.
This is done by maintaining  the number of collection period days.
Receivables Aging Based on the table above, the amount of current trade  receivables in 2023 was recorded at Rp3.25 trillion,  experiencing an increase of Rp0.46 trillion or 16.31%, compared  to the previous year which amounted to Rp2.80 trillion.
Meanwhile, trade receivables with a maturity of 1-30 days were  recorded at Rp0.35 trillion in 2023, experiencing an increase/ decrease of Rp0.38 trillion or 51.74%, compared to the previous  year which amounted to Rp0.73 trillion.
Trade receivables with a  maturity of 31-90 days were recorded at Rp0.13 trillion in 2023,  experiencing a decrease of Rp0.01 trillion or 2.16%, compared to  the previous year which amounted to Rp0.14 trillion.
Meanwhile,  trade receivables with a maturity of more than 90 days were  recorded at Rp0.40 trillion in 2023, experiencing an increase of  Rp0.22 trillion or 126.66%, compared to the previous year which  amounted to Rp0.18 trillion.
This indicates that the Company’s  trade receivables in 2023 included in current category or be  under 90 days, while the total amount of trade receivables that  were more than 90 days old was Rp398.95 billion.
The provision for impairment of trade receivables in 2023 and  2022 is Rp0.15 trillion and Rp0.10 trillion, where Management  believes that the reserves formed are sufficient to cover the  decline in value of the Company’s trade receivables.
Capital Structure Details In carrying out its business, PTBA has established a capital  structure policy which is a balance between liabilities and  equity, in which an optimal combination of capital structure  can maximize the value of the Company.

Comparison between Targets and Realization in  2023 In the 2023 financial year, the Company has set a number  of targets to be achieved which are outlined in the 2023  Company Work Plan and Budget (WP&B).
The comparison of  the achievement of several targets set with the realization for  the 2023 financial year is as follows: In general, the Company’s performance in 2023 exceeded the  targets set in the 2023 WP&B.
This is due to the company’s  commitment to optimize all existing resources.
Discussion  of target achievement in aspects that are important for the  Company are as follows: Production and Purchasing In the 2023 WP&B, the Company set a production and  purchasing target of 41.04 million tons.
Until the end of 2023,  the Company’s actual production was 41.94 million tons or  102% of the 2023 WP&B target.
The achievement of the  WP&B target was due to additional purchases of coal from  PTBA’s subsidiary, namely PT BAP.
Coal Transportation In the 2023 WP&B, the Company set a coal transportation  target of 32.00 million tons.
Until the end of 2023, the  Company’s coal transportation realization was 32.42 million  tons or 101% of the 2023 WP&B target.
The achievement of  the WP&B target was due to good synergy between PTBA  and PT KAI in optimizing coal transportation.
Sales In the 2023 WP&B, the Company set a sales target of 41.24  million tons.
Until the end of 2023, the Company’s sales  realization was 36.97 million tons or 90% of the 2023 WP&B  target.
The non-achievement of the WP&B target was due to  a deep decline in the coal price index, so that several sales  plans using transportation other than rail must be postponed  while waiting for an improvement in coal prices.
In addition,  the delay in the realization of the COD of Sumsel-8 CFPP from  the initial target also contributed to the non-achievement of  the sales target.
Stripping Ratio In the 2023 WP&B, the Company sets a target stripping ratio  of 6.31 times.
Until the end of 2023, the Company’s realized  strip ratio was 6.28 times or 99% of the 2023 WP&B target.
The decrease was due to mining optimization as an effort to  increase the Company’s efficiency.
Revenue In the 2023 WP&B, the Company sets a revenue target  of Rp40.35 trillion.
Until the end of 2023, the Company’s  realized revenue was Rp38.49 trillion or 95% of the 2023  WP&B target.
The failure to achieve the WP&B target was  due to the weakening of the coal price index or lower than  planned.
Profit for the year attributable to Owners of the  parent entity In the 2023 WP&B, the Company set a net profit target of  Rp9.50 trillion.
Until the end of 2023, the Company’s realized  profit before tax was Rp6.11 trillion or 64% of the 2023 WP&B  target.
The WP&B target was not achieved due to the inability  of achieving the two targets as explained above and the coal  regulations related to Mitra Instansi Pengelola (MIP) not yet  being implemented.
Capital Structure In the 2023 WP&B, the Company set capital structure 51.66%.
Until the end of 2023, the realization of capital structure is  79,77% or 154% from 2023 WP&B target.
The WP&B target  was not achieved due to the payment of dividends in 2023  on PTBA’s entire net profit for the 2022 fiscal year.
Projections for 2024 Entering 2024, the Company has set a number of targets as  outlined in the 2024 WP&B, which was prepared based on a  number of assumptions and by considering the Company’s  performance in 2023.
For production and purchase,  PTBA targets 41.34 million tons in 2024, an increase from  the previous year’s target of 41.04 million tons.
For coal  transportation, PTBA targets 33.69 million tons in 2024, an  increase from the previous year’s target of 32.00 million tons.
With the increase in production volume target, PTBA also set  a sales target of 43.11 million tons in 2024, an increase from  the previous year’s target of 41.24 million tons.
In addition,  PTBA targets a stripping ratio of 6.44 times (x) or an increase  from 2023 of 6.29 times (x).
The increase in stripping ratio is  related to the expansion of the mine sequence in preparation  for the increase in production volume for the Tanjung Enim- Keramasan Railway Transportation Development Project  which is targeted for commercial operation in the second  quarter of 2025.
Based on the 2024 WP&B, PTBA has set a financial target  of operating income in Rp43.72 trillion.
On the other hand,  the Company always commits to maintance the net profit  performance positively in the fluctuation of coal price.
For  target of capital structure is 69,16%.
The target of capital  structure is the comparision of the liabilty and equity target  in 2024.
The dividend policy itself refers to the Initial Public  Offering (IPO) Prospectus which was established by the  Company in 2002, while based on this prospectus, the  Company promises to pay a minimum dividend of. 30%,  in the event that the Company records a profit, while still  paying attention to funding for company projects and paying  attention to the GMS decisions.
The financial targets set above may change from time to time,  considering that the business carried out by the Company is  very dependent on world coal index prices, both for the New Castle index and the Indonesian Coal Index (ICI-3), and rupiah  exchange rate to US Dollar.
Dividend Policy Referring to Law no. 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability  Companies, the Company distributes dividends based on the  decisions of the Annual GMS or Extraordinary GMS.

Potensi gangguan  berupa bencana karena faktor alam (Natural disaster) atau  faktor manusia (Man-made disaster) dapat diatasi dengan The Company’s business continuity in the future will still  be supported by business in the Coal segment as well as  business development projects in business diversification  into other sectors such as energy and coal downstreaming.
In the future, the Company’s dependence on income from the  coal segment is expected to decrease in line with increasing  income from the energy sector and coal downstreaming.
By taking advantage of the momentum regarding the coal  significancy as an energy source in the global energy mix  for the next few years, PTBA continues to accelerate the  completion of projects to increase transportation capacity  to support the monetization of coal reserves, which are  currently still very large.
In addition, business development  projects such as the construction of a mine mouth coal fired  power plant, the development of new and renewable energy  based power plants and coal downstream projects are being  completed on time.
The Company also pays attention to  research and development programs that support the use of  new technology that provides added value in the future.
In line with the announcement of the target of achieving net  zero emissions (NZE) by the Indonesian Government by 2060,  the Company is also committed to integrate decarbonization  programs throughout the Company’s value chain in the future.
This is part of the Company’s vision to become a world-class  energy company that cares about the environment.
Moreover, through the implementation of the Business  Continuity Management System (BCMS), the Company has  also prepared strategies during a disruption or disaster that  has a potential to impact on the continuity of the Company’s  business.
As an integrated mining company that has a product supply  chain starting from the upstream (pit) to the port/barging port  (port), PTBA is aware that their business processes have the  potential for disruption or obstacles that could disrupt the  continuity of the Company’s business.
In carrying out the Company’s business process activities,  ideal conditions cannot be fully guaranteed and the ability to  maintain business process continuity is a necessity.
Potential  disruptions in the form of disasters due to natural factors  (Natural disasters) or human factors (Man-made disasters) can  be overcome with planned and measurable work patterns Informasi Kelangsungan Usaha  Information on Business Continuity Ikhtisar Keuangan Financial HighlightLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company Profile252 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam Tbk Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysispola kerja dan rentang waktu yang terencana dan terukur.
and timescales.
For this reason, the Company implements  Business Continuity Management (BCM) as mitigation to  support resilience in critical business operations.
If a disaster  or disruption occurs, business operations will still continue.
In planning the business continuity strategy, the Company  first conducted a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to determine  the critical business processes in each unit.
In addition, a  Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) is also carried out that may  occur and have a catastrophic impact so that the business  process is stopped for a long time.
Potential disasters that could have a significant impact on  the Company’s critical business processes based on BIA and  TRA include the following: 1.
Damage to main production and supporting equipment. 2.
Natural disasters (landslides, floods, earthquakes,  tsunamis) that disrupt operational activities. 3.
Damage to railway facilities and/or infrastructure. 4.
Employee/contractor strikes that disrupt critical business  functions. 5.
IT damage that disrupts the operational processes of  critical business functions.
PTBA’s seriousness in ensuring business continuity is  proven by obtaining ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity  Management System (BCMS) certification issued by The  British Standards Institution (BSI) with an effective period  from August 3, 2022, to August 2, 2025.
Certification is obtained by fulfilling the requirements of ISO  22301:2019 implementation of BCMS, including conducting  regular drills/simulations of disaster scenarios that could  disrupt the continuity of the Company’s business.
Business Prospect The Company’s business is currently still dominated by coal  sales.
Therefore, the Company’s future business prospects  will still be greatly influenced by demand conditions and coal  price fluctuations, in both global and domestic markets.
In  2023, global demand for seaborne thermal coal reached its  highest point in history.
Indonesia is still the largest thermal  coal exporter with production of more than 770 million tons,  which is also the highest production figure in Indonesian  history.
In 2024, global demand for seaborne thermal coal is projected  to decline slightly from 2023 in line with the projected  weakening of the global economy and strengthening issues  related to the energy transition.
The trend of weakening coal  prices after reaching an all-time high in 2022 is projected to  continue in 2024 as happened in 2023.
Prospek Usaha dan Strategi ke Depan  Business Prospects and Future Strategies Ikhtisar Keuangan Financial HighlightLaporan Manajemen Management ReportProfil Perusahaan Company Profile254 Laporan Tahunan 2023 | PT Bukit Asam Tbk Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisThe World Bank in the 2024 World Economic Situation and  Prospects projects a decline in global economic growth from  2.7% in 2023 to only 2.4% in 2024, in line with the projected  decline in economic growth in several countries that are the  driver of global economic growth and are also the main coal  importing countries in the world, such as China and India.
As geopolitical issues subside which had caused several  developed countries to prioritize their national energy  security by reactivating coal-based power plants, policies to  accelerate the energy transition after COP 28 are projected  to be intensified again.
This condition will greatly influence  the landscape of global coal demand and prices in 2024.
In the domestic market, the majority of the Company’s supply  will still be distributed to the state-owned electricity company,  PLN, where the selling price has been set in accordance with  regulations.
If the plan to implement the Management Agency  Partner (MIP) scheme is effective in 2024, PTBA will be able to  gain profits due to domestic supply compensation which is a  much higher portion compared to other coal companies.
In 2024, the company will also increase its production and  sales by optimizing mining activities, coordinating with PT KAI,  to ensure transportation targets can be achieved, as well as  optimizing sales plans, either via rail or other transportation.
Future Strategy To achieve the State’s mandate for MIND ID to become a  World-Class Company (Global Fortune 500), the Company  is dedicated to diversifying its revenue streams beyond coal  sales.
This is a crucial aspect of the company’s long-term  business transformation and vision strengthening efforts.
Mining In this pillar, the development strategy includes strategic  initiatives in the fields of reserves, production and  operations.
In terms of reserves, the Company focuses  on safeguarding existing reserves and controlling new  reserves.
Safeguarding of existing reserves is carried out  through strict monitoring of existing IUP boundaries and  timely extension of mining concession (IUP).
In relation  to the control of new reserves, the Company is open to  every option, whether through acquisition, auction, or  assignment from the State.
Regarding the strategy in the production sector, the  company will gradually increase production every year,  in order to accelerate the monetization of coal reserves.
Apart from that, it is hoped that by increasing the amount  of production, there will be efficiency in unit operational  costs because it is in line with the principle of economies  of scale.
The implementation of digitalization of operations  and the application of technology allows reducing  environmental impacts and increasing work safety for  greater operational cost efficiency. 2.
Logistic, Infrastructure, and Trading This pillar relates to developments in the fields of logistics,  infrastructure, and trading.
The main objective of this  pillar is to support a sustainable supply chain through  reliable mining operations and coal distribution to ports,  as well as additional coal sales destination options.

Concerning logistics development, the Company  continues to strive to increase rail transportation capacity  and is looking for options for other modes of transportation  to keep up with the rate of increase in production.
For  infrastructure, the Company also continues to make  new investments selectively to ensure the continuity of  the company’s business.
Last but not least, developing  a trading business here does not only include buying  and selling mining products, but also looking for ways to  diversify market sources, and ensure products can reach  consumers efficiently and safely. 3.
Downstream, Energy, and Utilities This pillar refers to processing coal into more valuable  derivative products, developing alternative energy source  commodity businesses, and improving energy efficiency.
In  addition, this pillar also includes innovations in renewable  energy technologies and implementing cleaner and more  efficient solutions.
This includes utility management and  the provision of reliable and sustainable energy services  to society.
Concerning the Downstream business development,  the company is exploring the potential for economical  and value-added coal derivative products, such as DME,  MEG, Coal Carbonization and others.
Then regarding  the development of energy commodities, apart from  continuing to look for potential coal-based generating  opportunities, the company continues to expand its  business into the new and renewable energy (EBT)  sector, as well as exploring business opportunities in the  supply chain and energy technology.
In developing its  business in the Energy sector, the company implements  a development strategy that includes organic growth and  strategic alliances, both domestically and abroad.
Green Business This pillar focuses on sustainable and environmentally  friendly business growth.
This involves the exploration  and implementation of green technologies and initiatives  that can support the circular economy.
The goal of this  pillar is to create solutions that reduce environmental  impact, including reduced emissions and better waste  management.
This pillar also includes the development  of products and services that support environmental  sustainability and contribute to tackling climate change.
The realization of strategic initiatives from this pillar  includes PTBA’s involvement in the carbon business,  either as a buyer or seller of carbon units.
Then followed  by the Company’s effort in developing develop a business  based on product life cycle development produced by  business and social activities in the company environment.
Lastly, the company also intends to expand into the green  solutions business by providing waste management  technology, reforestation and land rehabilitation, and  environmental monitoring technology.
The Mining Pillar and the Logistics, Infrastructure and Trading  Pillar will be the main pillars of the Company’s coal segment  business, while the Downstream, Energy and Utilities and  Green Business Pillars will support the business development  of other segments.
Along with business development, the Company is also  committed to carrying out decarbonization throughout the  company’s value chain as a form of support for achieving Net  Zero Emission (NZE) in the Indonesian energy sector in 2060.
The decarbonization strategy carried out by the Company  is based on 3 (three) main pillars, namely Operational  Decarbonization, Transition to a Cleaner Portfolio, and  Emissions Offset.
Through these three pillars, it is hoped  that the Company, both in its operations and business  development, will be more environmental friendly and more  sustainability oriented.
