As the global and national economy improved in 2021, energy demand showed a significant growth.
The world’s economic growth in 2021 was influenced by the  COVID-19 pandemic.
The spread of the delta variant and the  uneven distribution of vaccinations in many countries created  new uncertainties to control the COVID-19 pandemic.
Another  challenge was the disruption to global supplies, including energy  supplies, which triggered an increase in energy prices and  became an energy crisis in China, as well as Europe.
These conditions also affected the global economic growth rate  in 2021.
The International Monetary Fund in its publication  stated that world economic growth reached 5.9%.
This was  lower than the initial projection of 6.0%, but higher than the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) projection of 5.8%.5.07 2017 2018 2019 2020 20215.17 5.02 3.7 2.07 Kontribusi, Pencapaian dan Ikhtisar Kinerja Contributions, Achievements and Performance HighlightsProfil PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy ProfileWalau terkoreksi, namun tumbuhnya ekonomi global telah  dapat menggerakan roda ekonomi.
Although corrected, the global economy growth has managed  to move the wheels of the economy.
The trade volume between  countries has shown an increase, while the adjustment of world  commodity prices continued in line with increasing market  demand.
This condition affected the national economy and  boosted Indonesia’s export performance, thereby strengthening  the domestic monetary foundation in the face of monetary  policies implemented in developed countries.
Based on The  Economist press release from the Ministry of Finance, the  Indonesian economy is quite strong, there are no orange or red  indicators that indicate vulnerability.
However, Indonesia needs  to remain prudent and maintain external debt, Forex reserves,  and current account balances.
The national economic growth rate in 2021, based on the  Ministry of Finance and the Central Statistics Agency (BPS)  publications was 3.7%, still within the Government’s target  range of 3.5%-4.0% year on year (yoy), following the national  economic recovery contracting by 2.07% in 2020 due to the  COVID-19 pandemic.
From data published by the Central  Statistics Agency (BPS), the main business fields that recovered in  2021 were in the manufacturing, trading and mining industries.
The global and domestic economic recovery in 2021 will  continue in 2022, despite some volatility and uncertainty.
Risks,  such as the spread of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19  virus, accelerated tapering off in the US, increasing global  inflationary pressures, and the slowdown in China’s economy  still need to be kept in mind by the government and businesses,  including the energy sector. 102 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual Report Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTinjauan Industri Energi Energy Industry Review Industri energi nasional termasuk sektor yang terdampak  pandemi COVID-19, sebagai pengaruh penurunan kebutuhan  energi di sektor penggerak ekonomi utama, yaitu: industri,  transportasi, komersial, dan sektor lainnya.
The national energy industry was one of the sectors affected by  the COVID-19 pandemic due to a decline in energy demand  in the main economic driving sectors: industry, transportation,  commercial, and other sectors.
As the global and national  economy improved in 2021, energy demand showed a  significant growth, although it is still dominated by fossil energy,  especially oil and coal.
Increased demand triggered an increase  in oil and coal prices, so the Government carried out governance  to ensure that exports did not interfere with the sustainability of  domestic energy supply.
On the other side, world awareness driven by developed  countries in Clean Energy Demand Initiatives (CEDI), continued  to encourage fulfillment of energy needs by providing clean  energy to support climate change mitigation, and increase the  green economy.
Indonesia’s decision to join CEDI shows the  Government’s seriousness in realizing this energy transition,  and accelerating steps to achieve the Nationally Determined  Contribution (NDC) target by 2030, until finally achieving Net  Zero Emissions before 2060.
Simultaneously, the Government  continued its drive to develop new and renewable energy (NRE),  through support for infrastructure, technology and financing. 103 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual Report 104 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportKontribusi, Pencapaian dan Ikhtisar Kinerja Contributions, Achievements and Performance HighlightsProfil PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy ProfileTerkait EBT, Pemerintah menargetkan porsi EBT mencapai  15,7% dari bauran energi nasional dalam Prioritas Nasional  (PN) Rencana Kerja Pemerintah (RKP) 2022.
For EBT, the Government targets the NRE portion to reach 15.7%  of the national energy mix in the 2022 National Priority (PN)  Government Work Plan (RKP).
This portion will increase to 24%  by 2030.
To achieve this target, the Government has set several  targets.
One being the fulfillment of energy needs by  prioritizing an increase in NRE with a (cumulative) capacity of  13.9 Giga Watt (GW), and increasing the acceleration of NRE  power development by 1,921.8 MW. 105 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsAnalisis Industri Geothermal Salah satu sumber energi yang akan dikembangkan untuk  mendorong penambahan pembangkit listrik tenaga EBT  adalah panas bumi.
Geothermal Industry Analysis One of the energy sources needed to encourage the additional  EBT power plants involves geothermal, as Indonesia has the  second largest geothermal resource.
As of December 2020,  the Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources noted that Indonesia’s geothermal resources were  23,965.5 MW, or around 24 GigaWatts.
However, geothermal  energy has not been utilized optimally.
The installed capacity of  geothermal power plants has only reached 2,130.7 MW, or less  than 9% of the existing resources.
The use of geothermal energy in Indonesia still needs more  development, considering the current use of geothermal resource  reserves is still less than 10% compared to geothermal potential.
Based on the national landscape, Indonesia has wide spread  geothermal reserves, but most are in Sumatra with an installed  capacity of 0.7 GW of a potential 9.1 GW; Java with an installed  capacity of 1.3 GW of a potential 9.1 GW; and Bali with an  installed capacity of 0.01 GW from a potential 1.7 GW.
Data published by the Directorate General Geothermal, the  Director General Geothermal, the Directorate General New,  Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) of the  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, stated that there is still  1,620 MW of geothermal potential that has not been exploited  from the 21 WKPs that have been explored.
To encourage the use  of geothermal potential in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and  Mineral Resources included geothermal energy in the Electricity  Supply Business Plan (RUPTL).
It is hoped that the installed  capacity of PLTP , which is currently 2,130.7 MW, will increase to  more than 4,000 MW by 2030.
Overall, until the end of 2020, Indonesia occupied the second  position in the list of countries that use geothermal energy to  produce electricity.
The first position being the United States with  an installed capacity of 3,676 MW PLTP , then Indonesia (2,130.7  MW), the Philippines (1,918 MW), Turkey (1,526 MW), and New  Zealand (1,005 MW).
The total installed capacity of geothermal  power plants in the 10 largest countries is 15,345.7 MW.
Analysis of PGE’s Position in the National  Geothermal Industry After starting geothermal utilization 38 years ago, PGE continues  to strengthen its position as a leader in geothermal management  as a power plant.
Overall, by the end of 2021, the Company  manages geothermal nationally with an installed capacity of  1,887 MW.
The Company made various efforts to optimize production  capacity and maximize production, along with efficiency and  cost optimization.
In developing capacity building to increase  capacity, the Company implements a project management  system for project activities so that they are On time, On Budget,  On Scope, and On Return (OTOBOSOR) while still prioritizing  the HSSE aspect.
Company continues to target additional installed capacity.
Over  the next 10 years, the Company plans to increase the installed  capacity of self-operated PLTP to 1,540 MW.
Company will  continue to increase the installed capacity of its own operations  to reach 1,300 MW.
If the target in 2030 is realized, Company  will not only rank first in geothermal management, but also be  included in the top three geothermal producers in the world. 107 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsTinjauan Operasi Per Segmen Usaha Operational Review Per Business Segment Sasaran dan Strategi Perseroan  Sasaran Perseroan harus sejalan dengan visi Perseroan yang  telah dituangkan dalam Rencana Jangka Panjang Perusahaan  (RJPP) Perseroan 2020-2024.

Geothermal Utilization Scheme Geothermal is highly flexible as its use does not depend on  climatic or weather conditions.
In general, the geothermal energy  can be divided into two: indirect use for geothermal power plants  (GPP), and direct use for other activities. 1.
Production Wheels 3.
Exhouster 8.
Cooling Tower 10.
Indirect Utilization The indirect utilization of geothermal energy for PLTP is carried  out by producing geothermal fluid from the reservoir which  then, the hot steam is flowed to the turbine to drive a generator,  through several stages: 1.
Well drilling is carried out in areas that have sufficient  geothermal resources (reservoir) to a depth of 700 - 3,000  meters;  2.
In geothermal fields where steam is dominant, the fluid  flowing from the well is only steam; 3.
In water-dominated geothermal fields, the fluid flowing from  the well is in the form of steam and hot water (brine); 4.
Geothermal fluid is flowed using a pipe to the separator to  separate its phase into steam and brine; 5.
The brine is re-injected into the reservoir through the injection  well;  6.
The steam is flowed to the turbine to turn the generator; 7.
The electricity produced by the generator is channeled to  transformers to adjust the voltage, then flows to the PLN  electricity network;  8.
Direct Utilization Direct utilization includes the exploitation of geothermal energy directly  without converting heat and/or fluid energy into other types of energy  for non-electrical purposes.
There are two geothermal direct  utilization methods that uses energy that appears on the earth’s  surface, as explained below: 1.
Geothermal fluids are channeled through pipes to low  pressure separators.
In this stage, hot steam and brine  will be separated.
Hot steam flows to the turbines, while  the hot water flowed to the heat exchanger to heat the  working fluid (water) so that the temperature of the  working fluid turns warm.
The warm water can then  be drained and directly used for fishing, ponds or hot  springs.
The heat from the hot springs is channeled to  heat exchangers to heat the water.
The warm water is  channeled to greenhouses and to water agricultural and  plantation products.
Cold water generated in this process  will flow back to the rivers or underground to maintain  balance. 2.
Geothermal fluid from hot springs flows into a heat  exchanger to heat the working fluid (air) and regulates  its temperature until it becomes warm.
The warm air is  flowed to warm the greenhouse and dry agricultural  and plantation products.
Cold brine resulting from this  process will be flowed back into rivers or to the ground to  maintain balance.19 1.

Current Business Segments The Company is a pioneer in the use and development of  geothermal energy in Indonesia.
The Company is positioned as  an Independent Power Producer (IPP) that carries out business  activities of producing and selling products in the form of  geothermal steam and electricity.
Geothermal Steam and Electricity Production Business  Segment Productivity of Steam and Electricity Production  Segment Overall, the Company’s electricity equivalent steam production  during 2021 reached 4,660.48 GWh, or 104.40% of the 2021  RKAP of 4,464.13 GWh, an increase of 41.69 GWh, or 0.91%  from 2020 of 4,618.27 GWh.
The increase in production  occurred in the Kamojang and Lumut Balai areas, while the  areas that experienced a decrease in production were in the  Lahendong, Ulubelu, and Karaha areas.
Kamojang Area Electricity equivalent production in the Kamojang Area in 2021  reached 1,750.7 GWh, or 115% of the RKAP of 1,522.2 GWh,  an increase of 101.5 GWh, or 106.6% from 1,649.72 GWh in  2020.
This was due to the faster shutdown tie-in of the 24/3  well piping (3 days from the planned 14 days), the planned total  shutdown of unit 2 (2 months, Sept-Oct 21) and retrofitting Unit- 3 (3 months, Oct-Dec 2021) not being implemented in 2021 (IP).
Lahendong Area    Electricity equivalent production in the Lahendong Area in 2021  reached 774.6 GWh, or 91.6% of the RKAP of 845.6 GWh,  a decrease of 53.26 GWh, or 93.5% from 827.88 GWh in  2020.
This was due to the shutdown of LHD 1 bearing turbine  & generator repair, which continued from 2020 and operations  starting on May 20, 2021 (not yet full load), LHD 3 Overhaul  reblading, which continued from 2020 to July 2021, LHD 6 force  outage repair of UAT mid Feb – May, and load sharing from unit  5.
Ulubelu Area Electricity equivalent production in the Ulubelu Area in 2021  reached 1,596 GWh, or 102.9% of the RKAP of 1,550.8 GWh, a  decrease of 16.86 GWh, or 98.9% from 1,612.86 GWh in 2020.
This was due to the postponement of the UBL-3 Turn Around (TA)  from 2021 to 2022.
Karaha Area Electricity equivalent production in the Karaha Area in 2021  reached 78 GWh, or 57% of the RKAP of 136.6 GWh, a  decrease of 7.6 GWh, or 91.1% from 85.60 GWh in 2020.
This was due to a shortage of steam supply since Nov 2019,  problems with GPP and PLTP stopping operations from  November 23, 2021 to December 31, 2021 due to landslides in  the well area and steam production pipes.
Lumut Balai Area Electricity equivalent production in the Lumut Balai Area in 2021  reached 460.6 GWh, or 112.7% of the RKAP of 408.67 GWh, a  increase of 18.38 GWh, or 112.7% from 442.22 GWh in 2020.
Sibayak Area PLTP Units I and II belonging to PT Dizamatra Powerindo are  not operating due to the condition of the main equipment  being unsupported, and unfit for operation, so the repair of  the PLTP was stopped, according to PT Dizamatra Powerindo’s  letter No. 059/DP-SBY/III/2016.
Furthermore, PT Dizamatra  Powerindo plans to build a new PLTP , but until the end of 2021  this has not been realized.
Based on the above matters, PT  Pertamina (Persero) as the Company’s Shareholder has sent  an Application for Legal Opinion to the Attorney General’s  Office of the Republic of Indonesia through Letter No. 690/ M00000/2017-S0 dated October 30, 2017, for problems  related to the implementation of the Steam Sales Contract (SSC)  with PT Dizamatra Powerindo.
This application was submitted  because until now the Company has not been able to utilize the  steam produced from the Sibayak Area, because according to  the SSC the steam can only be sold to PT Dizamatra Powerindo.
On the other hand, the Company has to incur asset maintenance  costs of IDR7 billion per year.
Segment Revenue The Company earns operating revenues through (i) the  Company’s own operations, consisting of sales of electric power  and steam produced at PLTP and steam wells to PLN and other  IPPs based on various ESC and PJBU, which have been signed by  the Company, and (ii) production allowances obtained from the  JOC Contractors that the Company has contracted to operate  within the Company’s WKP , which is usually 4% of the net  operating revenues of the JOC Contractors, except for operations  carried out by Star Energy Darajat which is 2.66% of its net  operating revenues.
Operating Revenues from the steam and electricity production  segment during 2021 was USD368,824 thousand, an increase  of USD14,863 thousand, or 4.03% from USD353,961 thousand  in 2020.
Exploration and Development Activities To ensure the availability of geothermal steam to fulfill sales and  purchase contracts and a sustainable business, the Company  carries out exploration and development activities in all WKPs  based on the business strategy in the Company’s Work Plan  and Budget (RKAP) and the Company’s Long Term Plan (RJPP).
Exploration activities consist of geoscience studies (geology,  geochemistry, geophysics, and geomatics and starting from  survey, processing, modeling, analysis, evaluation, interpretation  of geoscience data, and exploration drilling until a project is  ready to generate electricity.
Exploration and Development Activities Target and  Realization Well Repair Work Activities (KURS) including workovers, hole  cleaning and acidizing carried out during the reporting period  reached 9 wells, or 113% of the planned 8 wells as stated in the  RKAP .
All KURS work on the 9 wells was completed.
*) includes workover, hole cleaning and acidizing **) The realization of the Kurs work cost in 2021 is above the 2021 RKAP target (Revised) due to the acceleration of workover activities for one of the wells in  Ulubelu which is planned for multi-years (2021-2022), but has been completed in Q4 2021.
Exploration Activities Profitability During the reporting period, Company commenced exploration  activities at the Seulawah Agam WKP in Nanggroe Aceh  Darussalam (NAD).
WKP Seulawah Agam was with PT  Pembangunan Aceh (Perseroda) / (“PEMA”), after establishing a  joint venture company, PT Geothermal Energi Seulawah.
Based  on data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,  the Seulawah Agam Geothermal Block is estimated to have a  potential of up to 160 MW.
For the first stage, the PLTP Unit 1 will  be built with a capacity of around 55 MW.
The Seulawah geothermal development is a pilot project for  geothermal development in Indonesia under the Public Private  Partnership (SPPP) Scheme.
Later, the joint venture company  will sell the generated electricity to PT PLN (Persero).

Comprehensive Income Statement During 2021 the Company maintained its financial  performance and recorded positive achievements.
Overall, the  financial performance during 2021 was influenced by several  factors: • Operating revenues increased by USD14,863 thousand  or 4.20%, mainly due to increased sales of steam to  customers.
• Cost of revenue and other direct expenses increased  by USD18,133 thousand or 11.04%, mainly due to the  full commercial operation of Unit 1 in the Lumut Balai  WKP , and periodic maintenance activities at the Karaha  Cakrabuana WKP .

Operating Revenues The realization in operating revenues in 2021 was USD368,824  thousand, an increase of 4.20%, or USD14,863 thousand  compared to USD353,961 thousand in 2020.
This was due to an  increase in sales of steam to PT Indonesia Power, an increase in  sales of steam to PLN Ulubelu, an increase in sales of electricity  to PLN Kamojang, and sales of electricity to PLN Lumut Balai,  which were offset by a decrease in sales of steam and sales of  electricity to PLN Lahendong, a decrease in sales of electricity to  PLN Karaha, and a decrease in production allowances.

Current Year Profit Profit for the Year in 2021 reached USD85,042 thousand, an  increase of USD12,210 thousand, or 16.76% from USD72,832  thousand in 2020.
The increase was due to: • An increase in operating revenues due to increased sales  of steam to customers.
• A decrease in other expenses due to gains from the  foreign exchange difference due to the weakening of the  Japanese Yen exchange rate against the United States  Dollar, which affected the Company’s financial liabilities  in Japanese Yen.
• A decrease in finance expenses due to lower loan  interest expenses following the Company refinancing its  shareholder loan with a bridging loan at a lower interest  rate.

Ability to Pay Debt and Receivables Collectibility Company’s ability to pay debt, both short term and long  term is reflected in its Liquidity Ratio and Solvency Ratio.
The  Liquidity Ratio shows the ability to meet short-term liabilities,  and is measured by the Cash Ratio and Current Ratio.
• Cash ratio, calculated by comparing cash on hand with  total current liabilities.
• Current Ratio, calculated by comparing the total current  assets with the total current liabilities.
Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt (Liquidity Ratio) The Cash Ratio in 2021 stood at 63.88%, an increase from  22.96% in 2020; while the Current Ratio in 2021 stood at  142.6%, an increase from 47.4% in 2020.
Based on these ratios,  it can be seen that the Company’s ability to pay its debts in the  reporting period was relatively good.
Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt (Solvency Ratio) The Solvency Ratio shows the Company’s ability to meet its  obligations, and is measured by:  • Liabilities to Equity Ratio, calculated by comparing total  liabilities with total equity.
• Liabilities to Assets Ratio, calculated by comparing total  liabilities with total assets.
The Company’s Solvency Ratio in 2021 increased due to a  reduction in the Company’s debt following the bridging loan  mechanism.
Overall, the Company’s ability to pay its obligations  is still relatively good.
Receivables Collectibility Level The Company does not separate the calculation of the  collectibility level of long-term and short-term receivables.
The  Company’s Receivable Collectibility Level in 2021 was recorded  at 64.54 days, which decreased from 2020 which was recorded  at 82.55 days.
Collection period 2021 and 2020 is calculated using trade receivables only from sales of own operations and production allowances, because  the company did not record sales of KOB to PLN starting January 1st, 2020 due to the application of PSAK 72, but still recorded trade  receivables for sales of KOB to PLN. 151 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial StatementsStruktur Modal dan Kebijakan Atas Struktur Modal Capital Structure and Capital Structure Management Policy Pemerintah menargetkan  porsi EBT mencapai 15,7%  dari bauran energi nasional  dalam Prioritas Nasional (PN)  Rencana Kerja Pemerintah  (RKP) 2022 The government targets the NRE portion to reach  15.7% of the national energy mix in the National  Priority (PN) of the Government Work Plan (RKP)  2022Struktur modal Perseroan tahun 2021 terdiri atas 48,73%  Liabilitas, dan 51,27% berupa Ekuitas.
The Company’s capital structure in 2021 was made up of  48.73% Liabilities, and 51.27% Equity.
This was a change from  the Company’s capital structure in 2020 which was made up  of 59.2% Liabilities, and 40.09% Equity.
This change was due  to a decrease in short-term liabilities through the repayment of  all principal and interest payables on shareholders’ loans that  have matured using bridging loans in the form of long-term bank  loans, and the conversion of part of the principal shareholder  loans into paid-in capital.
Capital Structure Management Policy The Company is part of PERTAMINA PNRE Subholding.
Thus,  the capital plan is prepared based on approval by PT Pertamina  (Persero) as a Shareholder, with reference to the Company’s  Articles of Association.
Company’s capital structure policy is aimed at strengthening  Equity.
As of December 31st, 2021, the ratio between Liabilities  and Equity in the capital structure was 49:51, compared to  60:40 in 2020.
This shows that the Company runs its business  using capital sourced from equity.

Information disclosure on customer complaints and their follow- up can be found in the PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy 2021  Sustainability Report.
The Company continues  to optimize the electricity  production and supply, and  develop the use of geothermal  as an alternative for electricity  supply.
The global economic recovery also impacted the national  economy, which briefly contracted in 2020, then grew 3.7%  in 2021.
A more controlled COVID-19 pandemic despite  the emergence of the Omicron variant, has brought with it  confidence that the national economy in 2022 will continue to  grow.
The World Bank estimates that Indonesia will continue its  economic growth momentum in 2022.
In their Global Economic  Prospects report released in January 2022, they predict  that Indonesia’s economic growth will reach 5.2% this year.
According to the World Bank, Indonesia’s economic growth will  be supported by strong domestic demand and rising commodity  prices.
Global and national economic improvement need energy so  that economic growth can be maintained.
This can be seen in  the increasing demand for energy, including electricity.
PT PLN  (Persero) reported that in 2021 the industry sector saw growth  in electricity consumption of 10.5%, with the textile sector  contributing 23.4% to the industry sector growth, followed by  the steel industry contributing 21.7%, and the household sector  contributing 2.3%.
An energy consumption increase was also reported by the  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources that stated electricity  consumption per capita throughout 2021 rose to 1,123 kWh/ capita, from the previous year’s 1,089 kWh/capita.
Meanwhile,  for 2022, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources projects  electricity consumption per capita will increase significantly to  1,268 kWh/capita.
These predictions can be seen as prospects for Company’s  business as it provides electricity from the PLTP it operates.
The  Company is continuing to optimize the electricity production and  supply, and develop the use of geothermal as an alternative  for electricity supply.
There are also regulations that provide  opportunities to expand electricity sales directly to end-users  under the Power Wheeling scheme, namely the Electricity Law  (UU) No. 30/2009, Government Regulation (PP) No. 14/2012,  and the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM)  Regulation No.1/2015.
Opportunities to develop geothermal is very open, and  it is supported by the following conditions: • Indonesia’s geothermal energy potential is very large  (23,965.5 MW); • Geothermal is a renewable environmentally-friendly energy; • There is a Government commitment and program to increase  the utilization of NRE, including geothermal, to meet the  national energy needs.
Ministerial Decree No. 39K/20  MEM/2019 targets an energy mix of geothermal power  plants starting at the end of 2025 of 23%, and to accelerate  the renewable energy mix target, it is possible to add power  plants using renewable energy sources outside the RUPTL  2019-2028 in line with the needs of the local electric power  system; • New Concession Areas (WKP) can be obtained from the  Government through a tender process for a direct assignment  to conduct a preliminary survey up to the exploration stage; • Geothermal energy can be optimized in existing fields with  proven alternative technologies such as binary systems; • Geothermal energy, gas and associated minerals in  geothermal fluids can be optimized to become products that  have a commercial value.
This has been proven and widely  developed in many countries; • A number of international financial institutions are interested  in providing low-interest loans to finance the Company’s  development projects, including funding for the Geothermal  Resource Risk Mitigation (GREM) exploration phase; • Many other companies wish to partner and share risk with  the Company. 165 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportAnalisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management Discussion and AnalysisTata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate GovernanceLaporan Keuangan Financial Statements Berdasarkan asumsi yang telah dijabarkan di atas disertai  adanya berbagai peluang, Perseroan optimis untuk dapat  senantiasa meningkatkan kinerjanya.
Based on the above assumptions and the various opportunities,  the Company is optimistic that it can continue to improve its  performance, meaning that the Company has good business  prospects.
The Company’s strengths in facing the business  challenges and prospects are presented as follows: • We have the rights to manage 14 (fourteen) WKP with  geothermal prospects in the high enthalpy category and can  determine their own development schemes; • We dominate and manage 1383 MW of geothermal reserves,  consisting of proven and probable reserves, from our Own  Operations of 899 MW and 484 MW, and proven reserves  from Joint Operation Contracts (JOC) of 1,205 MW; • The Company already has a Steam Sale and Purchase  Agreement Contract (PJBU) through a long-term contract; • We have more than 35 (thirty five) years experience in the  geothermal business; • We have competent and experienced human resources in  geothermal management; • We have funding capabilities supported by PT Pertamina  (Persero) and have been trusted by international funding  institutions (lenders), such as the World Bank and Japan  International Cooperation Agency (JICA); • Our operational activities are supported by PERTAMINA and  its affiliates; • We are incorporated with the PERTAMINA Group with its  market potential for marketing geothermal products; • We have been granted privileges by the Government for  an all-inclusive tax for existing WKP , including a deposit of  the Government’s share of 34% of net operating income,  including tax obligations and other levies (Reference:  Presidential Decree No. 49/1991).
Challenges When applying our long-term goals achievement strategies and  programs, the Company manages each challenge properly,  carefully, and wisely.
The challenges the Company faces in  developing the geothermal business include large risks and a  long period of return on investment, while the geothermal market  structure in Indonesia is monopsony and the off-taker has strong  bargaining powers.
There are also considerable challenges from  IPP companies in other industries that produce more competitive  selling prices than geothermal IPPs, such as coal IPPs, gas IPPs,  and others.
In addition, there is a tendency for geothermal  operations to be located in areas prone to landslides. 166 PT PERTAMINA GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Laporan Tahunan 2021 Annual ReportKontribusi, Pencapaian dan Ikhtisar Kinerja Contributions, Achievements and Performance HighlightsProfil PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy ProfileKelangsungan Usaha dan Strategi Keberlangsungan Usaha Business Continuity and Business Continuity Strategy Perseroan secara rutin melakukan Assessment terhadap  kemampuan, pencapaian target kinerja, serta prospek usaha.

The Company also maintains business continuity by ensuring  the safety and security aspects of operations.
This is inseparable  from the topography of the geothermal potential area which is  generally located in the highlands and mountains.
The Company  cooperates with various parties including universities to develop  an early warning system, as a detector for landslide disasters in  the vicinity of the PGE Area and Project.
In addition, every PGE  Area and Project is equipped with a gas detector to detect gas  leaks and the presence of toxic gas, so that the safety of workers  and residents is guaranteed.
