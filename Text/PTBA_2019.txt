Khusus pada industri batu bara, rata-rata indeks  harga batu bara thermal dunia berbasis FOB Newcastle (GAR Global Politic Economy and Global Coal Condition   2019 marked as the challenging year for the Company.
The  easing of the trade war between the United States (US) and  China at the end of 2019 and early 2020 became a major event that gave optimism to the global economy; especially  when China decided to trade with the US in the agricultural  sector.
Financial markets in various countries began to show optimism which tend to be positive.
Likewise, the geopolitical  conditions in the European Zone which were entangled in the  Brexit issue began to show certainty after Britain increasingly showed a tendency to take unanimous decisions out of the  European Union.
Although the conditions at the end of 2019 looked pretty  encouraging, the economic situation in 2019 showed uncertainty.
At the beginning of January 2020, the World  Bank provided a calculation of the predicted global economy  in 2019 that only reached 2.9%, below the 2018 economic  growth of 3%.
Not much different, the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), in early January 2020, projected economic growth to be 2.9%, trimmed from the projections released in October  2019 of 3%.
The tension of the trade war affecting the  weakening world trade and manufacturing activities, financial market pressures in several major developing countries, and  geopolitical conditions in several regions, gave a situation of  uncertainty to the world economy.
The world economy experienced slowdown which also  occurred in the US economy, made US Government through  the Fed, US Central Bank, decided to cut the interest rate.
Based on data released by the IMF, throughout 2019, the Fed  lowered the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) policy rate by 75 bps,  from 2.50% to 1.75%.
In addition, the Fed also implemented an accommodative policy through the purchase of securities  to tighten liquidity in the US financial system.
This US policy  then impacts foreign capital flows in the financial markets of developing countries.
Influx of capital flows from outside  causes various developing countries to have the opportunity  to keep their benchmark interest rates at the expected level, including Indonesia.
The global economic slowdown also had an impact on world  commodities.
The crude oil, palm oil and coal, experienced a  downward price trend in 2019.
tons, decreasing by USD29.57 per ton or 27.65% compared to the same period the previous year of USD107.34 per ton.
The decrease was mainly triggered by oversupply of coals in  Asia Pacific due to the expansion of coal sales from Russia  and Colombia.
The expansion of coal sales from the two countries is the impact of the decline in coal demand in the  European region along with the increased use of renewable  energy in several countries in the region.
In addition, the decline in the world coal price index was due to a decrease in  coal demand, especially high calories from Japan and Korea  due to an increase in the use of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
The economic condition of China as the largest coal importer  that has not yet experienced a bounce also contributed to  the decline in the world coal price index.
Not only that, India as the second largest coal importer restricts imports and  continues to increase its domestic coal production.
Indonesia Economy and National Coal Industry  In the midst of the global economic conditions that tend to  experience a slowdown, Indonesia is actually able to keep its  economic growth from being eroded into a global economic  slowdown.

In the import and export spending sector, there was a negative achievement in line with the trade balance  deficit due to weakening trade transactions due to a slowdown  in various export and import destination countries.
The amount of consumption in the expenditure of Indonesia’s  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is mainly due to the success of Bank Indonesia in maintaining the inflation rate.
In early January  2020, BPS released an inflation rate throughout 2019 of 2.72%  which is the lowest since 1999 where the inflation rate at that time was at 2.13%.
The decision of the Government of Indonesia  to withstand the increase in the price of Basic Electricity Rates  (TDL) and Subsidized Gasoline is a priority agenda to maintain  the ability of public spending.
The attractiveness of Rupiah assets is also reflected in  movements in the Rupiah exchange rate which recorded better  volatility than the previous year.
The exchange rate of the Rupiah against the US Dollar (USD) throughout 2019 was in the range  of Rp13,919 to Rp14,525 per USD, compared to the exchange  rate of Rupiah throughout 2018 in the range of Rp13,289 to Rp15,238 per USD.
However, the optimistic tendency of the Indonesian economy  amidst the challenges of a slowdown in the world economy does  not have a positive impact on the national coal industry.
The  downward trend in the world coal price index has an impact on Indonesian coal prices.
