The Company was incorporated in August 2019 and was a dormant  entity until March 2022.
In March 2022, the Company acquired a  49.0% indirect interest in CSID and a 28.4% indirect interest in  BSID, through the acquisition of a 95.3% direct interest in MIN,  the holding company of CSID and BSID (the project companies for  the CSID and BSID RKEF Smelters, respectively).
Through the MIN  acquisition, the Company also owned a 51.0% interest in SCM, the  project company for the SCM Mine.
In April 2022, the Company  gained control of CSID and BSID by acquiring additional shares  comprising an additional 1.1% interest in CSID and 21.7% interest  in BSID, which resulted in the Company holding a 50.1% indirect  interest in each of CSID and BSID.
In March 2022, the Company  also acquired a 100% direct interest in MED, the holding company  of several entities that provide supporting infrastructure for the  SCM Mine and RKEF Smelters.
Through the MED acquisition,  the Company also acquired a 32.0% indirect interest in IKIP, the  project company for a nickel industrial park to be jointly developed  and operated by the Company and the Tsingshan Group within  the SCM Mine IUP area.
In May 2022, the Company acquired ZHN  by investing in shares, resulting in the Company owning a 50.1%  direct interest in ZHN, the project company for the ZHN RKEF  Smelter, which is currently under construction.
In December 2022,  the Company acquired 66.4% interest in BPI by way of subscription  for new shares in BPI, which in turn owns an 80.0% interest in  MTI, the project company for the under-construction AIM I Project,  giving the Company a 53.1% effective interest in MTI.
In January  2023, the Company, directly and indirectly, acquired an additional  33.6% interest in BPI, which resulted in the Company holding a  100% effective interest in BPI.
Following these acquisitions, MBMA Group’s revenue, expenses  and total assets significantly increased as of and for the year  ended 31 December 2022, reflecting the significant increase in the  scope of its operations.
Accordingly, MBMA Group’s consolidated  financial position and results of operations as of and for the years  ended 31 December 2022 and 2021 are not comparable.
NiEq Production Attributable to MBMA Group is calculated as NiEq Production for the year multiplied by MBMA Group’s controlling interest percentage as of the end of the  relevant year. 2.
RKEF Cash Cost is a standard industry measure used by most major nickel companies which reflects the direct costs involved in producing each tonne of nickel, including  related transportation costs.
RKEF Cash Cost is calculated as U.
Dollars per tonne of nickel unit produced.
SCM Mine The SCM Mine has rich limonite nickel resources, with the right  mix of limonite nickel (77%) as compared to saprolite nickel (23%).
Limonite nickel ore is highly suitable for the production of Mixed  Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) through HPAL plants, which can then  be converted into nickel sulfate for use in EV battery production.
All saprolite nickel ore produced by the SCM Mine is intended for  future hauling of the Company's RKEF Smelters located in IMIP.
The large resources of SCM Mine support multi-decade nickel  ore supply for downstream operations.
This potentially attracts  downstream asset partnership opportunities which provides the  Company with predictable long-term production and cash flow.
RKEF Smelters The Company operates RKEF Smelters located in the IMIP area in  Morowali, Central Sulawesi.
Currently two RKEF Smelters facilities  are already operating profitably, namely CSID and BSID, each with  a nameplate capacity of 19,000 tpa Ni in the form of Nickel Pig Iron  (NPI).
CSID RKEF Smelter  The CSID RKEF Smelter is a NPI production plant consisting of two  RKEF production lines located within IMIP.
The CSID RKEF Smelter  was commissioned in November 2019 and became revenue- generating in January 2020, following which its first production run  rate has comfortably exceeded its aggregate nameplate production  capacity of 19,000 tpa Ni.
NiEq Production Attributable to MBMA Group is calculated as NiEq Production for the year multiplied by MBMA Group’s controlling interest percentage as of the end of the  relevant year. 2.
RKEF Cash Cost is a standard industry measure used by most major nickel companies which reflects the direct costs involved in producing each tonne of nickel, including  related transportation costs.
RKEF Cash Cost is calculated as U.
dollars per tonne of nickel unit produced.
BSID RKEF Smelter The BSID RKEF Smelter is also a NPI production plant  comprising two RKEF production lines with a similar nameplate  production capacity and operational cost structure as the CSID  RKEF Smelter.
It is also located within IMIP.
The BSID RKEF  Smelter was commissioned in February 2020 and became  revenue-generating in March 2020, following which its first  production run rate has comfortably exceeded its aggregate  nameplate production capacity of 19,000 tpa Ni.
ZHN RKEF Smelter The Company is currently constructing a third RKEF Smelter,  ZHN, with an expected nameplate capacity of 50,000 tpa Ni and  is scheduled to start production in the second half of 2023.
In addition, the Company has plans to modify some of the lines  in certain of operating RKEF Smelters and ZHN Smelter to  provide an option to produce LGNM.
AIM Project AIM Project is a modern, integrated and strategically located in  the IMIP, Morowali, Central Sulawesi.
AIM Project has access to  complete IMIP infrastructure and is adjacent to the future acid and  steam off-takers, which will serve downstream players of the EV  battery value chain.
AIM Project is operated by MTI, a joint venture held 80% by BPI, the  Company’s subsidiary, and 20% by Tsingshan Group.
AIM Project, which is currently under construction, will operate  a concentrator for extracting pyrite concentrate, an acid plant, a  chloridizing roasting plant and a metal extraction plant.
The layout  has been optimized to ensure capital and operational savings over  the life of the project.
AIM Project is designed to treat spent ore and  low-grade pyrite ore from Wetar Copper Mine (a mine owned by a  subsidiary of MDKA) at a nominal rate of more than 1 million tonnes  per year.
IKIP produce several products, such as sulfuric acid, saturated steam,  iron ore pellets, copper sponge, lead-zinc hydroxides, gold and  silver.
In December 2022, MBM acquired a 66.4% interest in BPI, a  subsidiary of MDKA.
Further acquisition was executed and  completed in January 2023, which resulted in the Company holding  a 100% effective interest in BPI and AIM Project becoming an  indirect subsidiary of the Company with 80% effective interest.
The construction of the AIM project continued with detailed design  nearing completion, all mechanical and electric equipment purchase  orders placed, and prioritized tender finalization for pipes, cables,  manual valves and remaining steel structures.
Site works continue  to progress well in all areas.
The Project is currently on schedule  with the first production targeted in the second half of 2023.
HPAL Plants The Company plans to develop HPAL processing capabilities in IKIP  with HPAL JV partners.
The HPAL plants will provide the Company  with further exposure to the strategic materials and EV battery  value chain which will utilize large mine limonite resources of SCM  Mine.
HPAL plant is expected to process limonite nickel ore from  the SCM Mine with a planned capacity of 120 ktpa Ni in the form  of MHP, split into 2 (two) each 60 ktpa Ni phases  and is scheduled  to commence production in 2025.
MHP is a nickel intermediate  product from nickel laterite ore, to supply downstream precursor  materials used in EV battery production.
Nickel Matte The Company plans to expand its downstream project to produce  Class 1 battery materials, by having a nickel matte converter to  produce HGNM containing more than 70% nickel.
In line with this expansion, on 26 April 2023, the Company has  entered into Conditional Share Subscription and Purchase  Agreement to acquire a 60% interest in PT Huaneng Metal Industry  (HNMI) who has HGNM conversion facility, located within IMIP.
Historically, HNMI has sustained an annual production rate of  50,000 tonnes of nickel in nickel matte with LGNM grade supply  ranges from 18-22%.
This acquisition plan is conditional upon  satisfaction of agreed conditions precedent.
IKIP Partnering up with Tsingshan, the Company has entered into joint  venture to develop IKIP, an industrial park for battery raw materials  with an area of approximately 3,500 hectares, on which pursuant  to the Regulation of Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs  of the Republic of Indonesia No. 9 of 2022 on the Amendment to  Regulation of Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs of the  Republic of Indonesia No. 7 of 2021 on the Amendment to the  List of National Strategic Project, IKIP is designated as one of  the National Strategic Project.
Partnering with Tsingshan  allows MBMA Group to leverage Tsingshan’s proven track record  and experience in developing IMIP and the PT Indonesia Weda  Bay Industrial Park.
IKIP will be focused on the hydrometallurgy  processing nickel through HPAL plants.
Operational activities in  IKIP will give a strong emphasis on ESG.
As at the date of publication of this Annual Report, IKIP has  obtained the Approval on the Relinquishment of Productive Forest  Area Status into Non Forest Area for the Konawe Industrial Estate  on behalf of PT Indonesia Konawe Industrial Park, covering  an area of ± 3,854.37 Ha based on the Decree of the Minister of  Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia Number SK.  147/MENLHK/SETJEN/PLA.2/2/2023 dated 20 February 2023.
Other Assets The Company fully owns a limestone concession of approximately  500 hectares.
The Company is also the owner of, and is building, a  new haul road of approximately 20 km in length, linking the SCM’s  IUP boundary to BDM’s haul road, which is approximately 30 km  to IMIP.
The combined haul road can be used to connect mining  tenements adjacent to SCM Mine to IMIP in the future.
SCM has  signed an agreement with BDM to use its haul road for an indefinite  period.
The haul road is haulage grade but is still being upgraded.
The Company is also actively exploring opportunities to expand  downstream and manufacture other components of batteries.
MBMA Group segmented financial reporting based on the financial  information used by the chief operating decision-maker in  evaluating the performance of segments and in the allocation of  owned resources that divided to three operating segments:  a.
mining (which relates to operations of the SCM Mine), b.
manufacturing (which relates to operations of our RKEF  Smelters); and  c.
others (which relates to entities supporting infrastructure for  the SCM Mine and sub-holding entities with none or limited  operations).
NPI Production Process NPI is a low-grade ferronickel which initially gained popularity in  China as a cheaper alternative to pure nickel and is now recognized  as a widely used feedstock for the production of stainless steel.
MBMA Group produced NPI through the RKEF process, which  consist of two main steps: • Calcination - heating the ore in a drying kiln to remove water  and volatile impurities.
• Smelting - in an electric arc furnace to produce NPI which can  be used for the stainless steel production process.
Through MBMA Group partnership with the Tsingshan Group, has  also allowed MBMA Group to benefit from the vertically integrated  operations within IMIP, which delivers significant cost savings  and other optimizations and efficiencies as a result of the supply  of logistics, utilities, including access to port facilities, and power  and consumables required to operate the RKEF Smelters in IMIP.
RKEF processing generally requires a higher-grade ore feed  than blast furnace processing, so the Indonesian export ban has  significantly assisted the large-scale adoption of RKEF processing  in Indonesia, with an abundance of high-grade ore the export of  which was restricted.
Planned major maintenance on each of  the RKEF Smelters is scheduled to occur at regular intervals of  approximately three to four years.
A disadvantage of the RKEF process is its high energy usage, which  can make it uncompetitive in regions with high energy prices.
However, this has not presented a significant challenge for MBMA  Group operations at IMIP.
A basic flowchart of the simplified RKEF process is set out in the  diagram below.
Nickel Matte Production Process Nickel matte is an intermediate smelter product that must be  further refined to obtain pure nickel metal and used in producing  nickel sulfate, is an integral component of the battery value chain.
MBMA Group intend to modify lines at certain of RKEF Smelters,  and has a converter facility so that (i) such RKEF Smelters has the  optionality to produce LGNM and (ii) process LGNM produced by  RKEF Smelter lines, with reducing the iron content, to produce  HGNM containing more than 70% nickel through converter facility.
MBMA Group expects to be able to switch the RKEF Smelters  between NPI and nickel matte production without major production  disruptions, where such switch is a commonly-implemented  procedure done by other smelters.
This would enable MBMA Group  to shift the production between NPI to be fed into the stainless  steel supply chain to nickel matte to be fed into the EV battery  supply chain.
MHP Production Process MHP is an intermediate nickel product produced from laterite  nickel ore, which contains both nickel and a small percentage of  cobalt.
MHP is typically produced using a HPAL process.
HPAL is a process used to extract nickel and cobalt from laterite  ore bodies.
A major portion of the laterite reserves may not be  processed through conventional pyrometallurgical treatment,  which requires higher grades and larger electricity requirements.
The HPAL process utilizes elevated temperatures , elevated  pressures and sulfuric acid to separate nickel and cobalt from the  laterite ore.
A summary of the HPAL process is as follows: • ore is mined and crushed to create a fine material; • this fine material is mixed with water to create a slurry which  is then preheated; • this hot slurry is pumped into an autoclave (a giant pressure  cooker of sorts) where sulfuric acid is added; • the slurry and sulfuric acid then react as they flow through  several compartments within the autoclave; • the slurry takes approximately 60 minutes to complete the  leaching process in the autoclave; • upon leaving the high pressure and temperature atmosphere  of the autoclave the slurry must be returned to atmospheric  conditions; and • this process is completed through two or more washing  processes.
Once the slurry reaches atmospheric conditions, it  is washed and separated at which point the nickel and cobalt  can be recovered from the liquid fraction.
The main advantages of the HPAL process are its cost effectiveness  and ability to rapidly leach nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores.
Other processes such as RKEF typically only treat saprolite laterite.
Production and Sales MBMA Group revenue is a function of, and directly correlates to, the  production volumes.
MBMA Group revenue generally increases as  its production volumes rises, followed with  the production costs  correspondingly increasing, and generally decreases as production  volumes decrease, with the production costs correspondingly  decreasing.
Production volumes of MBMA Group products are  primarily determined by (i) the production capacity and efficiency of  MBMA Group projects and (ii) the availability and grade of the nickel  ore feedstock.
Since the CSID and BSID RKEF Smelters commenced  production, production volumes have remained consistent, with  both smelters operating at a utilization rate of more than 100%.
To  further capture the rapid growth in nickel demand, MBMA Group is  currently constructing a third RKEF Smelter, ZHN, in the IMIP with  an expected nameplate capacity of 50 ktpa Ni, which is scheduled  to start production in the second half of 2023.
NPI is produced by smelting nickel ore, and its production depends  on the grade of nickel ore feed and the smelter load.
Saprolite  nickel ore typically with a grade of between 1.6% and 2.0% is used in  NPI production.
The quality of the saprolite nickel ore used as raw  material feedstock affects MBMA Group aggregate NPI production  volumes as the amount of nickel ore taken in by the CSID and BSID  RKEF Smelters is fixed and lower grade nickel will result in lower  volume of nickel produced.
Other factors affecting NPI production  volumes include the transportation infrastructure at MBMA Group  facilities, supply of electricity, as well as other environmental or  technical factors.
Unexpected maintenance or repairs at MBMA  Group RKEF Smelters can also result in production delays or halts  that can negatively impact MBMA Group production volumes.

Total production and sales quantity that presented represent total production and sales quantity of BSID and CSID for the full 12 months, in the purpose of comparative information.
For the year ended 31 December 2022, the manufacturing segment  recorded NPI production amounting 26,283 tonnes of NiEq, which is  the total NPI production produced by Smelter RKEF CSID and BSID  after the Company consolidated CSID and BSID into the operational  results of the MBMA Group since April 2022.
For the year ended  31 December 2022, the mining segment recorded production of  nickel ore of 1,028,412 wmt, which is the amount of nickel ore  produced by the SCM Mine after the Company consolidated SCM  into the operational results of the MBMA Group since March 2022.
Meanwhile, for the year ended 31 December 2021, there was no  production of NPI and nickel ore because the Company has just  consolidated its subsidiaries in 2022, which in 2021, the Company  is a dormant company.
In MBMA Group’s pro forma sales performance, the manufacturing  segment recorded sales of nickel ore amounting 38,655 ton, slightly  lower than nickel ore sales in previous year amounting 41,281 ton.
This is primarily due to the inclusion of NPI produced at the end of  fiscal year 2020 (which recorded as finished goods at 31 December  2020) in the volumes of NPI sold in fiscal year 2021.
MBMA Group sold all produced NPI to the Tsingshan Group, which  is sold on a per ton of contained nickel basis at a price based on  average published NPI prices, with minor adjustments applied  for freight and foreign exchange.
Thus, the average NPI price can  directly affect the revenue that the MBMA Group receives from the  sale of NPI.
The pricing of limonite nickel and saprolite nickel that  MBMA Group will sell is based on the Mineral Ore Benchmark Price  formula, which is derived from the London Metal Exchange (LME)  nickel price.
Although the price of NPI has also historically been  correlated to LME nickel prices, the NPI pricing in recent years has  increasingly been driven by its own supply/demand fundamentals,  and particularly affected by factors specific to China and featuring  its own particular characteristics as compared to LME deliverable  nickel metal.
These demand characteristics include Chinese  demand for NPI, production cost levels, macroeconomic factors,  such as expectations regarding inflation, interest rates and global  and regional demand for, and supply of, commodities as well as  general global economic conditions.
