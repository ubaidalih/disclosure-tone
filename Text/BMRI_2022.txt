GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS Annual Report 2022 251 AnnuAl RepoR t 2022 | pt BAnk MAndiRi (peRseRo) tBkMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 2022 OVERVIEW  The decline in the global economic growth  and the increase in inflation indicates that the global economic situation is in a fairly depressed condition.
Nevertheless, Indonesia’s economic condition remains resilient with 5.31% economic growth in 2022.
This growth is also higher than the economic growth of other countries and has consistently advanced above 5% yoy since the fourth quarter of 2021.
The acceleration of GDP growth was mainly supported by household consumption which grew by 4.48% yoy and investment which grew by 3.33% yoy.
The increase in household consumption in the third quarter was driven by increasing public mobility, while investment growth was mainly driven by investment in machinery and equipment.
Meanwhile, export performance also increased on the back of commodity price windfall.
Indonesia’s economic growth is also relatively more stable compared to other emerging market countries.
Indonesia’s relatively stable economic growth is supported by improving domestic demand and high export performance, as well as relatively maintained purchasing power amidst rising inflation.
The IMF projections in the World Economic  Outlook report of January 2023 stated that the Indonesian economy will reach 5.3% yoy by the end of 2022.
Whereas, Bank Indonesia (BI) forecasts the growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.3% yoy.
Meanwhile, the Government of Indonesia predicts the national economic growth to be in the range of 5.1% to 5.4% in 2022.
The optimism of the Government and Bank Indonesia for the achievement of national economic growth in 2022 cannot be separated from the relatively strong domestic economic fundamentals and accommodative policy mix.
In line with Indonesia’s improving economic growth, Bank Mandiri successfully recorded a positive growth performance, as reflected by the achievement of increased profits and maintained assets quality.
Bank Mandiri continues to monitor global and domestic economic indicators to enable optimum execution of business strategies.
The achievement of Bank Mandiri’s  performance in 2022 was resulted by the implementation of the Bank’s strategy that focuses on the ecosystem, both in terms of financing and funding.
Meanwhile, when compared to the same period in previous year, the Bank’s net profit grew 46.89% or reached Rp41.17 trillion on a consolidated basis.
Consolidated loans volume increased by 14.48% yoy to reach Rp1,202.23 trillion, with credit quality and maintained allowance for impairment losses adequacy.
On the other hand, deposits (consolidated) grew 15.46% yoy to Rp1,490.85 trillion.
This achievement has exceeded the target of Corporate Work Plan & Budget in 2022.

Further accompanied by the global high inflationary pressures and the risk of stagflation, global financial market uncertainty, and slackening investment activities.
The World economic outlook report  of January 2023 released by the international Monetary Fund (iMF) projected that the world economic projection in 2022 will only be able to grow 3.4% year on year yoy or higher than the projection in october 2022 of 3.2% yoy however remain lower than the achievement in 2021 of 6.2% yoy.
The sluggish global economic growth was also due to the prediction of weakened economic growth in developed and developing countries to 2.7% and 3.9% yoy respectively in 2022, compared to the previous year that reached 5.4% and 6.7% yoy, respectively.
during 2022, the global economy has been under pressure, making its growth space relatively limited.
in addition to not fully recovering from the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic with new variants continuing to emerge, the pressure is also greater with the prolonged geopolitical tensions, especially the war in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions on r ussia.
The pressure of geopolitical tensions has caused multiple disruptions to the global economic activity as a whole in 2022.

Annual Report 2022 253 AnnuAl RepoR t 2022 | pt BAnk MAndiRi (peRseRo) tBkECONOMIC REVIEW economic activity in the United  states (Us) in 2022 tended to slow  down, in line with high inflation and the implementation of tighter monetary policy.
Inflationary pressures in the Us are also caused by a tight labour market.
Meanwhile, in China, economic growth in 2022 is also predicted to weaken due to the ongoing implementation of zero Covid policy and heatwave, which has caused temporary closure of industries in several regions due to disruptions in energy supply.
However, accommodative fiscal and monetary policies by China amid low inflationary pressures are expected to withstand a deeper economic slowdown.
india’s GdP outlook in 2022 is also projected to be lower, influenced by a spill over of lower Us economic growth in 2022.
The world trade volume is  projected by iMF to only be able to grow by 5.4% in 2022, or decrease compared to the achievement in 2021 at 10.4%.
Meanwhile, the Global Manufacturing PMi according to J.
Morgan and s&P Global indicated a downward trend and has even begun to enter the contraction zone at the level of 49.8 since september 2022.
in december 2022, the Global  Manufacturing PMi continued to decline and touched the level of 48.6 This was partly due to the deteriorating absorption of new jobs and the contracting flow of international trade.
PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) TBk254 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe iMF also projected that global  inflation will increase from 4.7% in 2021 to 8.8% in 2022.
in which the projection of developed countries from 3.1% in 2021 to 7.3% in 2022, and the developing countries from 5.9% in 2021 to 9.9% in 2022.
This was mainly due to the increased prices of international commodities, such as energy and food.
The shock of rising inflation is most prevalent in the developed countries with greater variability in the developing countries.
ECONOMIC REVIEW Less favourable global economic conditions throughout 2022 have triggered central banks in many countries to respond by implementing tighter monetary policies.
The Fed Funds r ate (FFr)  increases are expected to be higher with a longer cycle.
Where as of december 2022, the Us Federal r eserve or the Fed has  raised the FFr benchmark interest rate by 0.5% to 4.25% to 4.50%.
Throughout 2022, the Fed have raised its benchmark interest rate seven times.
Cumulatively, from March 2022 to december 2022, FFr has increased 425bps or 4.25% from 0% to 0.25% previously.
The relatively high increase in the FFr will certainly enforce the strengthening of the Us dollar.
However, on the other hand, it will put pressure on weakening or depreciation of exchange rates in various countries.
The trend of exchange rate depreciation pressure is higher, accompanied by an increase in the global financial market uncertainty throughout 2022.
Moreover, developing countries experience a tougher pressure from foreign investment outflows.

The iMF projections in the World economic outlook report of January 2023 stated that the indonesian economy will reach 5.3% yoy by the end of 2022.
Meanwhile, Bank indonesia (Bi) estimated in the range of 4.5% to 5.3% yoy, and the Government of indonesia forecasted the national economic growth to be in the range of 5.1% to 5.4% in 2022.
The optimism of the Government and Bank indonesia for the achievement of the national economic growth in 2022 cannot be separated from the relatively strong domestic economic fundamentals and accommodative policy mix.
The Central s tatistics agency (BPs)  data stated that the indonesian  economy in 2022 was able to grow by 5.31% yoy.
in terms of expenditure, growth occurred in almost all components, except the Government Consumption expenditure Component (Pk -P)  which contracted by 4.51% yoy.

PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) TBk256 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe highest growth in the  expenditure component occurred in the export of Goods and services Component by 16.28% yoy; followed by the Consumption expenditure Component of Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (Pk -LnPr T) of 5.64%  yoy; Household Consumption expenditure (Pk -rT) component  of 4.93% yoy; and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Component (PMTB) of 3.87% yoy.
Meanwhile, the import component of Goods and services grew by 14.75% yoy.
The high growth in spending  on the export of Goods and services Component is supported by strong demand from major trading partners and the policy of accelerating palm oil exports.
Meanwhile, the high growth of the Pk-rT component remains in line  with the increase in community mobility, the limited impact of fuel oil (BBM) price adjustments, as well as the distribution of social assistance and energy subsidies.
The national economic recovery  was also reflected in positive performance in various business fields, mainly supported by the Transportation and Trade business sector which grew 19.87%, followed by the provision of accommodation and Food and drink that grew 11.97%, and other  services with a growth of 9.47%.
While the Processing industry which has a dominant role grew 4.89%.
Meanwhile, spatially, economic gains are supported by growth that occurs in all regions of indonesia, where Java island remain the focus  of the structure of the indonesian economy during 2022 with a contribution of 56.48%.
ECONOMIC REVIEW in terms of indonesia’s Balance of Payments (BoP) in 2022, Bi recorded a surplus driven by stronger export performance, thereby supporting external sector resilience.
The current account surplus in 2022 increased significantly to US$13.2 billion (1.0% of GdP) compared to US$3.5 billion (0.3% of GDP) in 2021.
such performance was mainly supported by increasing exports in line with high global commodity prices and solid demand for indonesian commodities, amidst increasing imports in line with the improvement in the domestic economy.
Meanwhile, the capital and financial account recorded a deficit of US$8.9 billion in 2022 in line with high global financial market uncertainty.
As such, the overall BoP in 2022 recorded a surplus of US$4.0 billion after recording a surplus of US$13.5 billion in the previous year.
Meanwhile, the position of reserve assets in indonesia as of December 2022 stood at US$137.2 billion, equivalent to 6.0 months of imports or 5.9 months of imports and servicing government external debt, which was well above the international adequacy standard of around 3 months of imports.
The r upiah exchange rate in  2022 have been relatively well  maintained amidst the very strong Us dollar and increasing global financial market uncertainty.
As of the end of december 2022, the rupiah exchange rate stood at rp15,568/Usd or depreciated 8.45% compared to the end of 2021 level.
r upiah depreciation  was relatively improved than the depreciation of currencies of several other countries in the region, such as the Philippines at 8.50% and india at 10.15%.
On inflation, BPS noted that the price developments of various commodities until december 2022 generally increased.
Inflation was recorded at 5.51% yoy, or an increase in the Consumer Price index (CPi) from 107.66  as of december 2021 to 113.59 in December 2022.
Inflation occurred due to the price increases indicated by the increase in most expenditure group indices due to the adjustments in fuel prices.
The three groups that experienced the largest increase in the index occurred in the transportation group by 15.26%; personal care and other services at 5.91%; and the food, beverage and tobacco group at 5.83% yoy.
Meanwhile, the expenditure group that decreased in the index was the information, communication, and financial services group by -0.36% yoy.
To maintain economic stability and  momentum in 2022, Bi has raised the Bi 7-day r everse r epo r ate  (BI7DRR) five times to 5.50% as of december 2022, an increase of 200bps from 3.50% in 2021.
The decision to raise the interest rate is a front loaded, pre-emptive, and forward-looking measure for Bi in order to reduce the inflation trend that tends to increase during 2022 and going forward.
Annual Report 2022 257 AnnuAl RepoR t 2022 | pt BAnk MAndiRi (peRseRo) tBkECONOMIC REVIEW in line with the gradual recovery of  indonesia’s economic growth during 2022, the overall performance of the banking industry also showed positive growth.
This was marked by banking intermediation, especially commercial banks, which grew double digits to 11.35% yoy in december 2022 compared to the same period in the previous year which was only able to grow by single digits of 5.24% yoy.
The soaring growth of commercial  bank loans in 2022 was supported by an increase in all types of loans, particularly investment loans and working capital loans, as well as equitable growth across all economic sectors.
in addition, it is also supported on the supply side by commercial banks that can keep lending rates accommodative, as well as implement loose lending standards in line with improving banking appetite in lending, especially in the industry, agriculture, Trade, Community services, and entertainment sectors.
Meanwhile, on the demand side,  the increase in intermediation of commercial banks in 2022 was driven by the continued recovery in corporate and household performance.
The improvement in corporate performance is reflected in the ability to pay, sales level, and the realization of higher capital expenditures, particularly for exporter corporations in the Trade and Mining sector in line with the high prices of indonesia’s main export commodities.
Meanwhile, the recovery in household performance can be seen from the improvement in household consumption and investment in line with consumer optimism.

The implications of these two global issues have indeed affected the global economic ecosystem.
However, on the other hand, the global economic ecosystem may be changing in a much better direction than before.
The iMF World economic outlook  report of January 2023 projected that the world economy in 2023 will only grow 2.9% yoy or lower than the predicted economic growth in 2022 of 3.4% yoy.
Meanwhile, the economic growth in developed and developing economies is projected to reach 1.2% and 4.0% yoy in 2023, respectively.
and the growth of world trade volume (goods and services) is predicted at 2.4% yoy.
indonesia’s economy will have  to address high uncertainty and increased global risks in 2023.
such risks are mainly attributable to the potential stagflation caused by a surge in global inflation due to supply disruption and economic slowdown as a result of geopolitical tensions.
Challenges that are also no less severe are the weakening of global trade, which has the potential to affect the pace of domestic economic growth and national export performance in the short term, as well as the potential for a global debt crisis due to increased cost of funds and interest rates that has the potential of capital outflows from developing countries.

in line with improving economic  conditions, the national banking industry has experienced notable growth over the past few years.
However, going forward, national banks are still encountering a number of challenges both short-term and long-term.
The risk of spill over as a result of the deteriorating performance of global banking will affect the domestic banking industry which has exposure to loans and transactions.

PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) TBk292 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISdiGiT aL BankinG CHaLLenGes in 2022  Bank Mandiri identified several  main challenges throughout 2022, such as the rapid development of fintech and Digital Banks, as well as diverse and dynamic customer needs.
another challenge is the  increase in smartphone users, which is estimated to reach 159 million people by 2024 and the acceleration of the use of digital platforms due to the changes in people’s shopping behaviour caused by the pandemic.
on the other hand, the Bank also  faces challenges related to edC, e-Commerce, and Qris.
For edC, Bank Mandiri is facing a shift in people’s shopping behaviour from using cards to online shopping, especially in urban areas, the transfer of business to online during a pandemic, and the resilience of merchants to address the pandemic and the recovery process.
For e-commerce transactions,  Bank Mandiri identified the rampant social engineering fraud transactions and theft of customer data in the e-commerce industry, e-commerce transactions are vulnerable to transaction disputes due to delays in delivery, goods disputes, and transaction cancellations due to pandemic uncertainty.
in addition, DIGITAL BANKING e-commerce transactions are still dominated by payment transactions using transfers/V a  compared to using cards.
For Qris, Bank Mandiri faces  the challenge of many MsMes that are not yet carrying out digital transactions even though the government plays an active role in supporting the empowerment of MsMes.
in addition, other challenges include the aggressiveness of fintech in acquiring Qris merchants, and the shift in people’s behaviour from card payments to digital payments.
diGiT aL BankinG PerForManCe dUrinG 2022  digital Banking  Performance of Wholesale segment Bank Mandiri moved to launch  kopra on 2 october 2021 is the  right measure.
k opra is a single  access digital service that becomes the centre of information and financial transaction activities for the business ecosystem of business communities in the wholesale segment and its value chain comprehensively from upstream to downstream (end to end).
The k opra application has the  competitive advantage to integrate all digital wholesale services into a single portal access.
as such,  business communities are able to meet all corporate needs, such as online forex transactions, trade and guarantees, value chains, smart accounts, cash management, and online custody in one hand.
For wholesale customers, the  kopra application is expected to  increase the Bank’s growth and profitability.
Meanwhile, for Bank Mandiri, the kopra application is  expected to be the foundation in realizing wholesale beyond lending.
The advantages of the kopra application are able to increase customer current account deposits and increase transaction volume in addition to increasing loans and becoming an anchor for the customer value chain.
in addition, k opra will increase the  Bank’s fee-based income.
Bank Mandiri can also measure the financial health of debtors from the number of transactions they make through k opra.
in the end, k opra  is believed to be able to support Bank Mandiri’s dominance in the wholesale business segment.
The achievements of the wholesale  segment in 2022 are as follows: Year Types Cash Management Trade & Value Chain Bank Guarantee 2022 Transaction amount rp13.837 trillion rp775.8 trillion rp102.8 trillion 2021 Transaction amount rp 11.411 trillion rp 552.8 trillion rp 94.3 trillion source: Bank Mandiri 4Q2021 performance presentation Annual Report 2022 293 AnnuAl RepoR t 2022 | pt BAnk MAndiRi (peRseRo) tBkdigital Banking  Performance of r etail  segment Bank Mandiri moved to add a  number of new innovations to the mobile banking program to become new Livin’ in 2021 which was able to strengthen the Bank’s performance.

Customers are also provided with superstore services, from insurance products, investments, to consumer loans.
The increase in active users of the  application positively contributes to Bank Mandiri fee-based income.

in addition, Bank Mandiri digital  transformation strategy is the right step supported by the large number of customers who shifted their transactions using the new Livin’ application from transactions using a TMs.

• The minimum reserve  requirement is determined by the central bank based on the percentage of third-party funds raised by banks, which must be maintained by banks in a current account at Bi.
SOLVENCY AND RECEIVABLES COLLECTIBILITY  ability to r epay Long- Term debt (Bank  solvency) Bank Mandiri Capital adequacy  ratio or C ar reached 19.46%  in 2022, slightly lower than the  previous year’s C ar ratio of  19.60%.
This ratio indicates that Bank Mandiri solvency is still good as it has exceeded the minimum Car ratio requirement from the  regulator, hence the Bank is able  to meet credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
• Bank Mandiri has a limit in the  form of a limit safety level, which is a projection of liquidity reserves for the next one month.
at the end of december 2022, Bank Mandiri’s liquidity reserves were above the safety level.
• riM is the ratio of the results of the comparison between loans and corporate securities that meet certain requirements held against deposits, securities that meet certain requirements issued by banks, and loans that meet certain requirements.
• LCr is the ratio between High Quality Liquid assets (HQLa)  and the estimated total net cash outflow over the next 30 days in a crisis scenario.
LCr aims to improve the resilience of banks’ short-term liquidity in crisis conditions.
The regulator that sets the LCR fulfilment at the lowest 100%.
• nsFr is the ratio between available stable funding and required stable funding.
The regulator sets nsFr compliance of at least 100%.
The achievements of the  aforementioned ratios are as follows: Bank Mandiri projects its liquidity position in the future through the liquidity gap methodology, which is a maturity mismatch between the components of assets and liabilities (including off balance sheet), which is compiled into a time bucket based on contractual maturity or behavioural maturity.
For the next 12 months, Bank  Mandiri estimates that liquidity conditions will be in a surplus position.
However, alternative funding is still prepared by the Bank, if market liquidity conditions tightened or not in line with predictions.
in addition, Bank Mandiri also  conducts regular stress-testing of liquidity risks in order to determine the impact of changes in market factors and internal factors in extreme conditions (crisis) on liquidity conditions.

Bank Mandiri took advantage of the momentum of economic recovery while directly contributing to the indonesian economy by disbursing loans.
in the midst of lending expansion, the Bank always prioritizes the principle of prudence in loan management.
one indication of improved loan management is the achievement of an nPL (gross) ratio of 1.88% in 2022, lower than the previous year of 2.81%.
The net nPL ratio also improved to 0.26% in 2022 from 0.41% in the previous year.
The improvement in the nPL ratio has a positive impact on Bank Mandiri loan collectability profile and reduces the allowance of impairment losses expense.
Bank Mandiri has standard  procedures in loan management from beginning to end.
For the wholesale segment, Bank Mandiri starts the loan management process by determining the target market through the Portfolio Guideline, which sets the industry Classification (attractive, neutral, selective) and the appropriate industry limit, as well as selecting and filtering target customers through industry acceptance  Criteria and name Clearance, to  produce a pipeline of qualified debtors.
This process is continued with a credit risk assessment using a series of credit risk tools (credit risk rating, spreadsheet, CP a, nak,  and so forth), which is then taken a decision by the Credit approver  authority Holder (through the Credit Committee Meeting) with a four-eyes principle involving the Business Unit and Credit risk Management Unit independently.
Meanwhile, for the retail or mass market segment, an automatically loan management is carried out by using a credit risk scorecard, by referring to the risk acceptance  Criteria for each product, and processed through an automated work-flow (loan factory).
Furthermore, for the credit  monitoring process, Bank Mandiri uses a Portfolio Quality review mechanism based on  the credit portfolio.
This process is followed by collection and recovery for non-performing parts of the portfolio.
The Bank also conducts a what-if analysis of wholesale and retail portfolios through a stress testing process using certain macroeconomic scenarios to anticipate worsening macroeconomic conditions.

in addition, the Bank always ensures capital adequacy to be able to meet credit risk, market risk and operational risk in order to support business expansion in normal situations and anticipation in stressful conditions.
in calculating the capital adequacy, Bank Mandiri refers to the regulations of the Financial services authority (o Jk) such as the  following: • PoJk no. 27 of 2022 dated 28  december 2022 on the second  amendment to Po Jk 11/ PoJk.03/2016 on the Capital  adequacy r atio for Commercial  Banks.

The method used by the Bank to measure market risk is the Basel ii s tandardised Measurement  Method, and internally uses Value at risk.
Meanwhile, to measure operational risk, the method used refers to the Basel ii Basic indicator approach.
