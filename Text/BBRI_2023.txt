PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 184 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 185 Economic   Review Global Economic Analysis The rate of global economic growth continued to experience  pressure.
After experiencing recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, the global economic growth trend slowed down again in 2022.
Global economic growth was recorded at around 3.5% in 2022, lower than the previous year’s achievement of 6.3% in 2021.
This was caused by a combination of pressures.
High global inflation due to supply chain disruption and very significant increased in benchmark interest rates by various central banks in the world, especially the Fed.
The trend of slowing global economic growth is expected to continue in 2023 and 2024.
The IMF as of January 2024 estimates that global economic growth in 2023 and 2024 will be 3.1% and 3.1%, respectively (Figure 1).

Of these four factors, the decline in the LEI in various major countries in the world (Figure 2) was one of the main indicators showing that the pace of the global economy in the future is likely to slow.
Until Quarter IV-2023, there were at least four indicators that reflected the rate of global economic slowdown, namely: (1) The movement of the Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) which has slowed down since May 2023, especially the manufacturing PMI, (2) The decline in the export rate of various main countries such as China and the US, which implied a decline in world demand, (3) a decline in active job vacancies in various countries, which  Figure 2.

There were at least four main challenges that needed to be monitored in the future, in line with the rate of global economic growth which was dynamic and fluctuating.
First, the global inflation trend was historically quite high (Figure 3).
The inflation rate in various countries is currently on a downward  trend, but remains higher than normal conditions (pre-pandemic in 2019).

Meanwhile, on the food commodity  side, weather disruption due to the El-Nino phenomenon disrupted food production activities and could push up food prices.
Inflation pressure is predicted to remain high in 2024 due to cost push inflation due to projected global commodity prices (energy and food) which were quite high, both energy and food commodities (Figure 4).
In terms of energy commodities, prices were expected to remain high, especially for crude oil due to cuts  Figure 4.

Third, monetary policy by various central banks in the world was expected to last for a relatively longer period of time or what is known as “higher for longer” (Figure 6).
The continued tightness of global monetary policy could suppress loan growth, which in turn could have a negative impact on global economic growth.
In financial markets, tight monetary policy reduce global liquidity, which could ultimately trigger instability in the global financial system.
Fourth, China’s economic recovery was lower than previously estimated due to slowing industrial activity and consumer demand.
This was caused by the ongoing property crisis, weak consumer confidence and high unemployment rates in the productive age group.

In 2023, the full year national economy grew by 5.05%, lower than the previous year’s 5.31%.
This slowdown was in line with the slowdown in economic growth of Indonesia’s main trading partners in the same period, including: India and the European Union.
In that period, India’s economic growth was recorded at 6.3%, lower than the previous year’s 7.2%.
Meanwhile, the European Union’s economic growth also decreased from 3.4% yoy in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023 (Figure 8).
Meanwhile, China’s economic growth increased from 3.0% in 2022 to 5.2% in 2023, supported by the easing of restrictions for the Covid-19 pandemic and various government stimuli.

Another component supporting GDP growth is government spending which increased (2023 = 2.95%; 2022 = -4.47%) as the election momentum approaches and social assistance to mitigate the economic slowdown.
Meanwhile, imports contracted (2023 = -1.65%; 2022 = 15.00%) as economic activity and domestic production slowed.
Based on aggregate demand, the national economic growth rate declined in 2023 due to slowing household consumption growth (2023 = 4.82%; 2022 = 4.94%) and slowing exports (2023 = 1.32%; 2022 = 16, 23%) (Figure 9).
The slowdown in domestic consumption is in line with slowing people’s purchasing power, which is reflected in the worsening sales growth of retail companies and the decline in the core inflation rate.
Meanwhile, exports slow down due to slowing global economic activity, especially in Indonesia’s trading partner countries.

One of the main causes was the slowdown in the manufacturing sector (2023 = 4.64%; 2022 = 4.89%) which contributed 18.67% to GDP.
Apart from that, growth in the trade sector (2023 = 4.85 %; 2022 = 5.53%) and agriculture (2023 = 1.30 %; 2022 = 2.25%) was also in a slowing trend.
However, several sectors recorded increased growth, namely the financial, construction and mining sectors.
Meanwhile, spatially, economic growth was quite strong throughout Indonesia, especially in Kalimantan, supported by the new capital development project.

Credit growth in November 2023 was recorded to have increased to 9.7% yoy from 9.0% yoy in the previous month.
However, this figure is lower than the position at the end of 2022 of 11.3% yoy.
Even though credit growth is in a slowing phase, credit quality is relatively well maintained and stable.
In December 2023, the gross value of Non-Performing Loans (NPL) was recorded to move steadily and was below 3%, namely 2.36%.
Meanwhile, banking industry liquidity is increasingly limited amid policy tightening.
Third Party Funds (DPK) growth slowed to 3.0% yoy in November 2023, from 8.9% yoy in the same period the previous year.
TPF growth was expected to be increasingly limited due to BI’s tight monetary policy and people’s saving ability weakening.
In the future, Indonesia’s economic growth is predicted to modestly slow.
This is evident by monitoring the movement of indonesia’s LEI which has been decreasing and contracting.
Apart from that, there was the threat of the El-Nino phenomenon which may support an increase in domestic inflation.
The El-Nino period caused drought in various regions in Indonesia, which in turn could have an impact on food production activities, and lead to an increase in domestic inflation.
This condition could negatively impact people’s pirchasing power in the short term, which could suppress national economic growth.
However, in the short term there are several driving factors that  could support national economic growth, including the potential for increased government spending to support slowing public consumption, the continuation of various infrastructure projects which were delayed due to the pandemic, the potential for domestic and foreign investment in the energy and commodity sectors, and the general election in 2024.
With these various conditions, Indonesia’s economic growth was estimated to grow by 4.89%-5.18% in 2023 and 4.81%-5.10% in 2024.

Apart from that, there is tightening liquidity in the banking industry as shown by the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) in November 2023 of 84.78% or an increase of 5.18% compared to November 2022.
In November 2023, total assets in the national banking industry was reached IDR 11,428 trillion or an increase of 5.1% yoy.
The same trend occurred in commercial bank loans which grew 9.7% yoy to IDR 6,966 trillion.
This shows that demand for credit in Indonesia is quite strong amidst economic and political uncertainty during the election era.
The number of Covid-19 restructuring loans also continues to decline in line with national economic growth with credit quality remaining maintained with Non-Performing Loans (NPL) in November 2023 amounting to 2.36%, which is an improvement compared to November 2022 of 2.65%.
Credit quality is currently controlled below the maximum level of 5% set by the regulator.

The efficiency carried out is reflected in the BOPO ratio in November 2023, BRI’s BOPO is at the level of 64.67%, below the BOPO in the banking industry which is at the level of 76.80%.
Achieving good performance was able to support BRI’s profit  achievement in November 2023 of IDR 39 trillion or growth of 11.90% (CAGR 2019-2023) above industry growth of 11.55% (CAGR 2019-2023).
BRI’s better net profit growth compared to the industry is supported by growth in interest income, interest expense efficiency and better growth in non-interest operating income compared to the industry.
BRI’s profitability ratio is still better than the national banking  industry.
This can be seen from BRI’s better Net Interest Margin (NIM) ratio, namely 6.89%, while the Banking Industry NIM is at 4.83%.
Apart from that, Return on Assets (ROA) reached 3.10% while in industry it reached 2.72%.

PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 205 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance Operating Segment Operating Segment Explanation and Productivity For management purposes, BRI is organized into 5 (five) operating  segments based on products which are as follows: • Micro Segment  • Retail Segment • Corporate Segment • Other Segments • SubsidiariesMicro Segment The micro segment is intended to serve the needs of banking products and services for individual customers and micro entrepreneurs in the context of empowering community businesses.
The micro segment includes Micro Business, BRILink Services and Social Entrepreneurship and Incubation Program.
MICRO BUSINESS DIRECTORATE PERFORMANCE SUMMART Entering 2023, the economic and social situation returned to normal after the pandemic.
The micro segment focused on the company’s aspirations to “strengthen retail banking”, by developing a holistic strategy for the 2023 micro segment by encouraging commercial loan growth and controlling funds in an ecosystem based on the rural saving concept.
The commercial loan growth strategy (Kupedes) became part of KUR’s soft landing, in line with the implementation of the new KUR policy in 2023 which focused on customer equality and focuses on customer equality and graduation.
The growth of the commercial segment (Kupedes) was driven by the customer base built during the 2020 - 2022 pandemic and recovery period of 2 million customers.
Through the support of big data analytical capabilities that can generate quality growth pipelines, the micro segment was able to grow yoy by 10.4% with NPL quality maintained at 2.4% and contributed by non-KUR loan growth yoy by 39.62%.
In 2023, the micro segment began to strengthen its third party  fund collection strategy through the concept of rural savings in which the flow of funds from business entrepreneurs was followed up to 2-3 layers above (suppliers, distributors and collectors) to grow micro savings by 1.64% with a low-cost fund ratio of 87%.
This overall strategy could be achieved by continuing the transformation of the micro segment which includes the areas of strengthening the BRI Unit organization, expanding business processes and business models, strengthening analytical data and risk management as well as shifting the business approach of the micro segment from a finance approach to an empowerment approach.
The Micro Segment strengthened the organization by improving  the revitalization of the loan officers, reorganizing the Micro Business Manager and replotting Head Units adjusted to their competencies, namely being able to compete strongly in urban or rural areas.
The change in business approach to an Empowerment Approach is also demonstrated through the expansion of the Kupedes Rejuvenation business process, Simpedes BISA, KECE 2.0, KECEKU (Automatic Supplement Feature), UMi Agent Partner Business Model and enhancement of BRILink Agent services.
Strengthening analytical data to support decision making, including more structured pipeline and activity management, as well as the use of customer behavior profiling to build more relevant risk management.
Empowerment focused on building an ecosystem and increasing the capabilities of business entrepreneurs through inclusion and literacy programs.
Strengthening business synergies between entities in ultra-micro holdings with SenyuM outlet services, data integration and the SenyuM Mobile platform were also performed.
This holistic strategy has been implemented in 2023 and will be the foundation for developing sustainable micro businesses in facing future challenges and competition.
MICRO BUSINESSIn 2023, BRI’s micro business performance was generally able to record positive growth in terms of both loans and savings.
This shows that BRI’s micro business has strong resilience in the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic, which also had an impact on the national business and economic sphere.
Apart from that, implementing programs and strategies relevant to the situation and conditions also became one of the keys to BRI being able to get through 2023 well.
The micro-segment, which is one of the backbones of the Indonesian economy, will always be BRI’s main business.
BRI has been providing the best service to the micro-segment since 1895, or 128 years as of 2023.
Having professional competence in micro business, BRI is consistent and committed to continuing to contribute to the development and empowerment of micro business entrepreneurs aligned with the development of their needs.
The existence of the micro business sector is an important part  of BRI’s business.
Therefore, BRI is committed to increasing support and empowerment for the ultra-micro segment in 2023, packaged with the spirit of digital transformation, namely go smaller, go shorter, go faster.
So that BRI’s financial services, such as the financing distribution process, can be carried out  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 206 more quickly and at more affordable costs.
Through this, it is  hoped that ultra-micro business entrepreneurs can maintain their businesses and quickly recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since 2020 BRI now also has a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) index called the BRI Micro and SME Index (BMSI) to measure business activity, sentiment, and expectations of micro business entrepreneurs regarding national economic conditions.
Based on the latest BMSI data, it can be seen that business conditions and optimism of MSME players regarding future economic recovery are increasing.

id platform as a transaction facility to bring buyers and sellers together without having to meet face to face.
Apart from making cash flow calculations easier for traders, this was also to support the Government’s Programeto minimize the potential for COVID-19 transmission while the pandemic is ongoing.
BRI continues to encourage public knowledge regarding non-cash transactions, especially QRIS so that transactions using this integrated system continue to increase.
BRI believes that with a simple and safe payment system through QRIS, the businesses of micro-entrepreneurs can be helped to grow even bigger.
This growth will lead to an increasingly positive pace of the national economy and improved social welfare.

Therefore, BRI’s micro business development in the future  will be carried out from a beyond banking perspective through product innovation as well as sustainable business processes and business models.
The synergy between BRI, Pegadaian and PNM will be carried out in harmony to create new sources of income as a new driver for the Company’s business growth (new growth engine).
Micro BRI business development is focused on improving the quality of business processes in operational lines, growth and quality of commercial credit as well as developing products and business models to create new sources of income by taking several strategic steps as follows: 1.
Product rejuvenation by developing turnover-based  products (loans with short tenors). 2.
Improving the quality of business processes includes, among other things, improving the revitalization policy for all marketing personnel in the micro segment, both for loan analysts and the positions of Assistant Micro Business Manager (AMBM) and Micro Business Manager (MBM). 3.
Creating new business models through the UMi Agent partnership business scheme, business expansion (scope up) of the Pasar Rakyat Indonesia/PARI and SenyuM Mobile applications, CASA acquisition based on a micropayment ecosystem, as well as collective empowerment of business entrepreneurs (business clusters, groups, lottery club). 4.
Increasing loan analysts’ capabilities with appropriate education and developing reliable supporting tools to strengthen their social role as digital instructors and financial advisors for micro business entrepreneurs.
Total outstanding bank only micro business loans in 2023 reached IDR 496.55 trillion, an increase of 10.44% compared to 2022 which was IDR 449.63 trillion.
This increase mainly came from Kupedes loans amounting to 64.32% yoy which is in line with BRI’s focus on being able to grow commercial loans and what is interesting is that almost 30% of the composition of Kupedes loans came from KUR customers who were able to move up in class both in terms of banking capabilities and increases business capabilities.
This KUR customer class upgrade is in line with the Government and BRI’s aspirations to continue to increase financial inclusion in the Micro segment.
To encourage acceleration and increase in financial inclusion, the Government has issued new policies related to KUR, one of which is a KUR customer graduation target, a target for new KUR recipient customers and loan cycle limitations.
BRI as the main bank in Indonesia operating in the Micro sector is always committed to growing together with Micro customers to create a strong and great micro segment.
Micro Business Strategies In 2023 Micro business has long been a core competency for BRI.
With the support of a wide office network and competent marketing staff, BRI has reached and served the financial service needs of micro business entrepreneurs to remote areas of the country.
The very large customer base became both an opportunity and a challenge for BRI to be able to optimize it to accelerate future micro business growth.
However, change occured quickly and inevitably.
The ongoing pandemic had encouraged widespread adoption of technology and had an impact on people’s behavior, including changing transaction and business patterns for micro-entrepreneurs.
Widespread adoption of technology provided options for business entrepreneurs and the micro community in general to enjoy borderless financial services and access to non-conventional commercial financing.
These conditions changed the competitive landscape for micro  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 208 Competitive Advantage and Micro Business Innovation The improvements of Micro Business Loan and Third Party Funds during 2023 was attributable to the various innovations that BRI executed, such as:1.
Commodity Platform (PARI)  BRI collaborates with third parties to provide solutions to commodity-based ecosystem players to more easily access digitally integrated BRI services through a commodity platform called Pasar Rakyat Indonesia (PARI).
In 2023 BRI will focus on egg, fish, onion, coffee, milk, feed, cashew nuts, pineapple, cassava, rice, banana, and mango ecosystems with a total acquisition of 73,716 users, with 305,655 transactions, bailout funds of IDR6.9 trillion and gross merchandise value of IDR25.2 trillion with a total of 27,647 breeders and a total of 15,848 collectors. 2.
BRI Codification Business System (BRIKODES)  In line with the aspirations of BRIvolution 2.0, namely “Champion of Financial Inclusion”, BRI is increasingly strengthening its commitment to expanding the reach of financial services to all levels of society.
This spirit of financial inclusion also shows that BRI, as the bank with the largest customer base in Indonesia, has been proactive in supporting the realization of the strategic achievement of national financial inclusion of 90% in 2024.
To realize BRI’s aspirations as a Champion of Financial Inclusion, it needs to be supported by providing a data analytics-based database so that it can provide comprehensive information.
With this information, we will be able to produce impactful strategies that are beneficial for BRI’s business performance with an innovative data management platform called “BRIKODES (BRI Codification Business System)”. 3.
id  BRI collaborated with third parties to provide solutions to business entrepreneurs in the market, both traders and buyers, through an e-commerce platform called New Pasar.
id to support MSME players, especially market traders, in increasing turnover through a wider sales reach.
Digitalization of traditional markets aimed to drive the market economy as an effort to increase market trader turnover, expand customer reach so as to provide profits for traders, increase engagement between BRI and MSME players to support the cashless movement and increase traders’ business capabilities through capital. 4.
Senyum Mobile  Holding UMi aims to combine key entities that can better develop the ultra Micro segment.
The ultra-micro ecosystem will help the journey of class advancement from the ultra-micro segment to the Micro segment.
The ultra Micro ecosystem will play an important role in improving the landscape of the ultra Micro segment in Indonesia.
Therefore, BRI created the SenyuM Mobile application which is an integrated digital sales platform used by marketers to market products across entities (BRI, PNM, and Pegadaian) 5.
KECEKU (Auto Supplement Feature)  In an effort to efficiency and accelerate micro loans, BRI’s Micro Business innovated by creating an automatic supplement feature for existing Kupedes debtors.
This feature made it easy and saved time for Credit Analysts and Debtors when applying for Kupedes loan supplementation to return to the initial limit in which the selected debtors could submit a supplementation process via the debtor’s own cellphone after receiving WhatsApp Blast from BRI Info without the need to come to the BRI Unit office. 6.
KECE 3.0  Ultra micro segment loan designed within the concept “go lower, go shorter, go faster” through convenience and speed.
KECE 2.0 Loan became a further development from the marketed KECE 1.0 loan by referral through UMi Partners.
The form of development in the KECE 2.0 loan was a process loan application services through the BRISPOT UMi Partners application.
In the KECE 2.0 service process, UMi Partners became the extension of the credit analysts’ hand who could initiate loans, but it was verified by BRI (Credit Analysts of BRI).
KECE Kupedes Loans could encourage performance and growth of Kupedes in BRI Unit through potential Ultra Micro customer.
Business Strategy in Business Prospects and Micro 2024The micro business segment is the segment with the largest portfolio at BRI and contributes positively to Indonesia’s economic growth.
It is recorded that 99.62% of MSMEs in Indonesia are micro and ultra-micro business entrepreneurs.
In the next few years, Indonesia’s demographics are projected to increase quite rapidly (285 million people in 2025, with 67.3% of them being of productive age).
In line with the population growth rate, the number of MSMEs will also experience a significant increase to reach more than 71.4 business entrepreneurs in 2024.
This illustrates how large the business potential of the micro segment is in the coming years.
However, the market changes very quickly and on a large scale.
The long-lasting pandemic has encouraged widespread adoption of technology and has had an impact on people’s behavior, including changing transaction and business patterns for micro business entrepreneurs.
Widespread adoption of technology has provided options for business people and the Micro community in general to enjoy borderless financial services and access to non-conventional commercial financing.
These conditions change the competitive landscape of Micro’s business in the future, especially with the presence of non-banking entities that provide financial technology services (P2P lending, paylater, business bailouts, and other similar services).
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 209 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance The dynamics of the micro business segment are also very volatile.
The adoption of technology during the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on changes in the behavior of the micro segment of society who are increasingly digitally literate.
It is recorded that 90.5% of MSMEs in Indonesia have smartphones and 75% of Indonesian educators are connected to the internet.
However, the average digitalization index is low, namely 48.7% and is not translated into business use (BRIRINS-British Embassy Research, 2023).
This condition is both a challenge and an opportunity in developing BRI’s micro business segment in the medium term.
The digitalization of micro business processes that BRI has carried out is one of the steps to increase productivity and work efficiency.
The low business digitalization index of MSME players is an opportunity for BRI to expand its business while empowering it with digital literacy regarding the use of digital technology to help develop debtor businesses through the PARI, Pasar.
id and Localoka ecosystem platforms.
In the next three years (2024-2026), BRI will strengthen the  positioning of its micro businesses in society with an ecosystem centric concept and the “Empowerment is Before Financing” strategy.
BRI will start monetizing the business processes and models that have been built since 2020 through the UMi partnership and ecosystem platform as a new driver for business growth.
BRI is also strengthening micro human capital by merging several micro functions in regional offices into ecosystem attacker functions in order to strengthen penetration in the micropayment business.
Mastery of micropayments is pursued by establishing an empowerment-based ecosystem.
Thus, apart from increasing the accumulation of community savings, it is hoped that it will also be able to increase the depth of community inclusion which will have an impact on improving living standards.
BRI’s micro business development also focuses on improving  loans quality, increasing income through inorganic income (increasing recovery rate), increasing competitiveness, and risk control.
In line with this, development within the current year (2024) will be pursued through several strategic steps as follows:1.
Increasing micro loan yields by focusing on the growth of quality commercial loans (Kupedes and BRIguna) and developing turnover-based products as a new source of income. 2.
Increasing competitiveness through strengthening the quality of human resources and work networks to be able to explore better business potential, especially in urban areas. 3.
Improving the quality of risk control by strengthening the micro-channel control system, utilizing data analytics, and improving the quality of business operations to reduce operational risks and potential losses that may arise.
Strengthening risk control is also carried out in the people aspect by rejuvenating the BRI Unit supervisor function to support the sustainability of micro businesses with more integrity. 4.
Improving the LDR structure by adjusting KPIs to focus more on fund acquisition and strengthening competitiveness, especially in urban areas.
The acquisition of micro funds is carried out in an ecosystem-centric manner, namely through mastering micropayments and empowering the ecosystem that has been formed to create close loop financing, so as to increase transactions and turnover of business funds at BRI. 5.
Optimizing the AgenBRILink partnership as an enabler to increase the productivity and span of control of orderlies so that orderlies can focus more on providing assistance and empowerment. 6.
Developing a digital business model with personal scoring to increase penetration in the digital loan market in a prudent manner. 7.
Strengthening BRI Group synergy to increase fee based income from sales of Subsidiary Micro bancassurance products. 8.
Improving BRISpot as a channel to increase the effectiveness of marketers’ work by developing restructuring and cross-selling menus for Subsidiary Entity products. 9.
Optimizing the potential of new business models (PARI, Localoka x Agen BRILINK). 10.
Strengthening the function of administrative officers to increase the PH balance recovery rate.
BRILINK SERVICE BRI has a human machine hybrid platform called BRILink Agent.
This becomes a partnership model offered by BRI to the public to expand BRI’s financial services.
The BRILink Agent business model applies social values in the form of community empowerment, financial inclusion, economic equity, dissemination of knowledge about banking in its role as a Laku Pandai Agent regulated by the OJK.
Meanwhile the application of economic value are through additional income for partners, mutually beneficial economic partnerships, diversification of partner businesses, extension of the bank network (operational efficiency).

In addition, 151,950 PNM Mekaar members had become BRILink Agents as a form of BRI synergy with the BRI Group.
BRILink agents can also serve MSME credit through a loan referral system and can distribute Social Assistance (Bansos) to the community.
Apart from serving loan referrals through UMi BRI partners, AgenBRILink can serve savings account openings with a referral system for the basic savings account type, namely Tabunganku.
AgenBRILink plays an important role in realizing true financial inclusion for all levels of Indonesian society.
Meanwhile, financial transactions grew 1.72% from 1,078  million transactions to 1,096 million transactions in 2023.
This increase in the number of financial transactions reflected AgenBRILink’s close, safe and sophisticated services to meet people’s banking transaction needs.
This increase in financial transactions was accompanied by an increase in BRILink sales volume which was recorded at IDR1,427 trillion.
From transactions carried out by AgenBRILink throughout Indonesia, BRI obtained fee based income of IDR1.56 trillion at the end of December 2023.
This value grew 9.46% from the same period in 2022 of IDR1.42 trillion.
Apart from that, AgenBRILink also increased its acquisition of low-cost funds (CASA) by IDR23.39 trillion, growing 13.17% from 2022.
BRILink Strategy in 2023 In 2023, BRILink focused more on increasing productivity and building the competitiveness of BRILink Agents by strengthening the Micro ecosystem with a partnership with Loan officer as BRI’s marketer for the Micro segment.
With 740 thousands of BRILink Agents spread throughout Indonesia and collaboration with BRI Loan officers, it is hoped that we will be able to build an independent microeconomic ecosystem, one of which is distributing loans through UMi Partner BRILink Agents.
BRILink Mitra UMi Agent is an agent focused on distributing Ultra Microloans to the community, so it is hoped that it will be able to provide benefits to all MSME players in terms of providing business capital to avoid loan shark practices.
Apart from that, to improve the quality of service, AgenBRILink continues to provide new initiatives and breakthroughs by adding product/service features and maximizing partnerships with the BRI Group that are tailored to community needs along with digital business penetration so that AgenBRILink can maximize its role from just banking assistance to being a sales/marketer.
In expanding reach through AgenBRILink, BRI used support tools to acquire new AgenBRILink using AI (BRIBrain) and considering regional potential (BRIKodes) in the form of behavior scoring (profiling, segmentation and pipeline) to produce quality AgenBRILink.
The number of BRILink Agents continues to increase, so it is  necessary to increase the capabilities and maintain the loyalty of BRILink Agent consumers to make them more competitive.
BRILink Agents’ knowledge of products and marketing skills also needs to be calibrated as BRILink products and services increase.
This will be accommodated by the BRILinkers application as a forum for Agents to share products, services, and ideas between BRILink Agents.
Even though AgenBRILink is close to and serves the Micro BRI market, AgenBRILink is not only an enabler for certain segments but also a business collaborator serving business for the BRI Group and being a center of community, selling consumer and SME products, and providing additional business for AgenBRILink through corporate partnerships.
BRILink Competitive Advantage and Innovation With BRILink Agents spread over more than 740 thousand throughout Indonesia, BRILink Agents had a competitive advantage, namely making it easier for the public to make financial transactions without having to go to the Bank.
BRILink agents could carry out banking transactions using EDC BRILink or BRILink Mobile in real time online.
The features contained in BRILink Mobile were also continuously updated according to the needs of today’s society.
BRILink innovation continued to be developed to continue to  compete with other competitors which were emerging one by one, namely by implementing Android-based EDC (MPos), of course one of BRILink’s innovation breakthroughs to continue to survive and improve its performance.
It was expected that  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 211 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance the implementation of the Android EDC made it easier for  BRILink Agents to update the latest features so as to increase the competitiveness of BRILink Agents Umi partnership.
BRILink Business Prospects and Strategies for 2024In 2024, in order to realize Bank Rakyat Indonesia’s (BRI) commitment to continue to expand AgenBRILink services and increase financial inclusion throughout Indonesia, BRI sees the importance of transforming the role of AgenBRILink from simply providing banking transactions to a “lifestyle micro provider” that is more in touch with needs and styles.
customer life in the micro segment.
This transformation is part of the AgenBRILink journey which is divided into 3 (three) phases.
The first phase involves AgenBRILink as a payment and banking services provider, which facilitates financial transactions.
Then in the second phase, AgenBRILink takes on the role of marketing ultra micro services, which includes providing a variety of financial and non-financial services that are relevant to the needs of the Micro segment.
The third phase, which is the next stage in AgenBRILink’s journey, involves a transformation into a more comprehensive “lifestyle micro provider”.
Along with technological developments and customer demand,  considering that BRI does not have its own e-commerce platform, and the amount of money in circulation is concentrated in the groceries business segment, there is an opportunity to take advantage of the wholesale business opportunity by integrating e-commerce features in the AgenBRILink ecosystem.
Localoka, as an e-commerce platform managed by BRI, has provided solutions for micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) groups to market their products online.
The integration of the BRILink Mobile application with e-commerce is expected to have a positive impact in increasing sales potential and profits for BRILink Agents.
In addition, expanding Localoka’s collaboration with corporate merchants is a strategic step that supports Localoka’s initial goal as a local ecosystem platform and provides added value for BRI MSME customers who have become and will become merchants on the Localoka platform.
This collaboration expands business opportunities and increases AgenBRILink at Localoka, so that AgenBRILink has the opportunity to buy goods wholesale at more competitive prices through corporate merchants who collaborate with Localoka.
By managing e-commerce, BRI can provide financing facilities  to customers and merchants when they carry out buying and selling transactions which can help increase BRI’s CASA growth which is more stable.
By maintaining the integrity of Localoka as a local ecosystem, this collaboration creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem for customers, AgenBRILink (as merchants) and BRI itself, in line with the mission of financial inclusion and local economic empowerment.
Apart from that, to expand the types of services that can be served by AgenBRILink, one of which is the Pawn feature which allows people around AgenBRILink to carry out Pawn transactions and payments without having to come to the Pegadaian Outlet.

In addition to the growth in wholesale/corporate segment figures, during 2023 the Institutional & Wholesale Business Directorate also implemented a collaboration strategy with the non-wholesale segment to increase value chain business acquisitions from wholesale customers.

Corporate Business Competitive Advantage and InnovationInstitutional & Wholesale Business development is directed at achieving the vision of Becoming The House Bank for Leading Indonesian Corporates & Institutions in 2025.
The Institutional & Wholesale Business segment focuses on building long-term strategic relationships with large customers.
BRI as the largest bank in Indonesia operating in this segment provides a variety of financial services to meet various customer needs.
The intense business competition currently faced by business  entrepreneurs means that business entrepreneurs are always looking for ways to make the business they run more effective and efficient, and of course generate maximum profits for business expansion needs.
Effective and efficient are the two main keywords delivered to customers.
By connecting all business activities of a business ecosystem on one banking platform, namely QLola by BRI, all business activities become digitally connected.
The effect of connecting the business activities of an industrial ecosystem on one platform, makes it easier for BRI business customers to carry out business activities such as payments, use of bailout facilities, bank guarantees, trade services and liquidity management.
By integrating all products and connecting business activities at QLola by BRI, it is also easy for BRI customers to monitor asset and liability portfolios, track ongoing business processes and calculate cash flow projections that must be prepared.
Therefore, we say that these things really facilitate the business activities of business entrepreneurs, so that business processes run more effectively and efficiently.
Business Strategy Business Prospects and Corporate for  2024In accordance with the business sectors managed by Corporate Business, namely agribussiness, manufacturing, consumer goods, health industry serta e-commerce, the business prospects for Corporate Business continue to increase, supported by economic improvements after the decline in Covid-19 which has encouraged public consumption.
The corporate business prospects and strategies are explained as follows:1.
Business prospect  Especially for non-SOEs corporate businesses, the agribusiness sector has quite good prospects, especially in the palm oil industry.
The prospects for the palm oil industry are now increasingly bright both in the domestic market and in the world market.
This sector will become increasingly strategic because it has a great opportunity to play a greater role in becoming a motor for national economic growth and absorbing labors.
Palm oil is a basic requirement for a number of foodstuffs, industrial needs and vegetable oil fuel.
The palm oil portfolio in the Agribusiness Division currently stands at 57%, so in the future it is possible for the Agribusiness Division to expand into sectors outside of palm oil with the aim of mitigating spreading risk, of course while prioritizing the top ten debtors in its business sector.
The manufacturing sector has very high prospects in line with the large demand from the public and the manufacturing sector each year contributes to the national gross domestic product. 2.
Corporate Business Strategy  Corporate Business Strategy will focus on several strategies, namely:a.
Optimizing existing customer transactions.
Looking for new sources of growth, by expanding to new customers and industry segments with a focus on fee income generation and transaction based business.
Selective loan growth by targeting customers with priority and investment to grow criteria, especially lending to new industries that are a priority for the government, including agro technology, green and food industries, energy security-based industries, and others.
Increasing the CASA portion of corporate customers in order to maintain wholesale costs of funds as efficiently as possible by applying the principle of transaction-based products and services.
Ecosystem-based business development for each industrial sector to optimize value chain potential by collaborating with SME, Consumer and Micro businesses, will prepare special offers for client business ecosystems from upstream to downstream and supporting services that can serve transaction, savings and loan needs as well as able to support the efficiency and effectiveness of clients’ businesses, especially regarding finances.

This change was in line with the effectiveness of majority ownership of PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero), Tbk on November 30, 2022.
Alignment of strategies and policies in Group synergy began to be carried out intensively in 2023 in various aspects of the Company’s business and operations expected to become the Company’s competitive strength in increasing its contribution to the Investment Manager Industry.
The various collaborations carried out were expected to increase the integration of BRI Investment Management as part of the BRI Group which had a vision of being The Most Valuable Banking Group in Southeast Asia and Champion of Financial Inclusion.
PT BRI Manajemen Investasi Business Prospect and Strategy  for 2024At the beginning of 2023, there were two significant things, namely the potential for a global economic slowdown and the potential for an end to monetary policy tightening.
During 2023, the Fed was recorded as raising interest rates 4x a total of 100 bps to the range of 5.25% - 5.50%.
This rate of increase was much lower than the rate of increase in the Fed Funds Rate in 2022, which was 7x, totaling 425 bps.
Meanwhile, United States inflation was in the range of 3.1% (November 2023), far below the 2022 position of 6.5%.
The Fed Chairman gave the signal to cut interest rates in his last speech last December considering the sloping inflation conditions and employment data which were below expectations.
In response to the Fed’s policy, Bank Indonesia was recorded as increasing BI7DRR only once during 2023, where BI7DRR closed at 6.00% at the end of 2023.
This increase occurred in October 2023, which was estimated to be BI’s step to maintain the stability of the Rupiah.
Our inflation level was recorded at 2.86% (November 2023).
With existing developments, BI projects GDP was in the range of 4.5% - 5.3% in 2023.
The Fed’s attitude of holding interest rates has had a positive  impact on the domestic financial market, which is reflected in the flow of foreign funds to emerging markets, especially Indonesia.
Overall, during 2023, based on settlement data up to December 21, 2023, foreigners were recorded as making net purchases of IDR81.40 trillion on the SBN market, net sales of IDR11.61 trillion on the stock market, and net purchases of IDR52.81 trillion on BI Rupiah Securities ( SRBI).
Mutual funds recorded YTD (November 2023) fell 2% due to a decline in money market and stock mutual funds, but on the other hand there were a number of products that recorded growth, such as mixed, protected, fixed income mutual funds, as well as ETFs and Indices.
BRI Investment Management itself, similar to Industry, also experienced a decline in the same two types of mutual funds but recorded growth in other mutual fund products.
In total, BRI Investment Management mutual fund growth YTD (November 2023) was 9% with a market share of 6.0% and ranking 5 (five) in the Mutual Fund Industry.
Meanwhile, regarding the total products issued by investment managers which included KPD and Alternative Investment products, BRI Management grew around 10% with a market share of around 4.7% - 4.9% and ranked 8th (eighth).
Entering 2024, both the United States and Indonesia will  hold a democracy party that year.
BI projects that Indonesia’s inflation in 2024 will be in the range of 1.5%-3.5% while GDP will be at the level of 4.7%-5.5%.
The circulation of money in public consumption spending during the 2024 election period  PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 260 is expected to support domestic economic growth.
With more  stable inflation and interest rates and higher GDP projections compared to 2023, 2024 is projected to be a year of balance between interest rate-based and stock-based mutual funds.
BRI Management’s internal research said that considering that in 2024 there will be a presidential election in the United States, economic success is very important for the current president so that the Fed is expected to be able to bring the United States economy to a soft landing in 2024.
As long as the United States economy slows regularly and achieves a soft landing, this could be a positive catalyst for riskier assets in developing countries like Indonesia.
However, despite the positive side of the possibility of a soft landing for the American economy, the main risk that must be monitored closely is war in the Middle East, where we all hope for a peaceful resolution as soon as possible.
In its development after the pandemic ended, a series of  regulations were issued by the OJK in 2023, some of which are derivatives of Law no. 4 of 2023 which regulates strengthening supervisory and regulatory relations between institutions in the financial sector in order to realize Financial System Stability.
This series of regulations will be a part of investment managers’ business activities in the future.
In the investment management industry, POJK No. 4 of 2023 related to RD KIK which includes OJK’s strategic policies in addressing liquidity issues in mutual fund management, conditions that result in mutual fund restructuring, and a number of efforts to develop mutual funds in Indonesia, apart from that, POJK No. 13 of 2023 concerning policies for maintaining capital market performance and stability in market conditions that fluctuate significantly, the OJK has the authority to take steps to determine policies for handling volatility, stimulus and/or relaxation for financial services industry players in the capital market sector.
With segmentation into the retail business, regulatory challenges are at hand considering Law no. 27 of 2022 regarding the protection of personal data will be effective in October 2024.
Strengthening internal control in terms of governance, compliance and risk management will be the main pillar of the business continuity of investment managers including BRI Investment Management.
This is also in line with the implementation of POJK No. 51 of 2017 concerning Sustainable Finance which will begin to be implemented in the investment manager industry in the coming year.
For this reason, infrastructure preparation is not only supported from the system side, but also from the side of human resource readiness.
In 2024, BRI Investment Management targets growth in managed  funds to IDR50 trillion.
Focusing on the retail segment and optimizing group synergy through flagship products will be the main strategy in efforts to build a solid business foundation and better maintain business continuity.
Several strategic enablers, apart from strengthening internal control as explained above, are continuously increasing HR capacity, strengthening integrated IT systems and digital infrastructure, as well as strengthening BRI Investment Management branding.
This branding strengthening is in line with the change of the Company’s name to BRI Investment Management and is carried out both internally and externally to the group.
The series of implementation of the BRI Investment Management strategy will be in line with increasing financial literacy and inclusion activities that are more collaborative and integrated.
Revenue and Profitability of Operating Segment Despite challenging economic conditions both globally and domestically, high interest rates and challenges from natural conditions such as El-Nino, BRI was able to continue its good performance in 2023.
In general, BRI’s profit was able to record growth in consolidated net profit of IDR60.42 trillion or growing 17.5% annually, all segments contributed positive profits and the largest was in the micro segment IDR22.47 trillion.
This is in line with BRI’s aspirations to increasingly focus on growth in the MSME segment, especially micro, which is the main segment in the economic movement Indonesia.
The growth of the Company’s net Income cannot be separated  from the optimization of NII which was recorded at IDR135.18 trillion or grew 8.5% yoy and the Company’s ability to efficiently and effectively use costs as reflected in the 2023 CIR ratio of 41.9% or lower than in 2022 of 44.9% Table of Revenue and Profitability Operating Segments in 2023 (in IDR million) Description2023 Micro Retail Corporate Others Subsidiary Total Interest and premium income  -

BRI KUR distribution is based on the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1 of 2023 concerning Amendments to the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Number 1 of 2022 concerning Guidelines for Implementing People’s Business Credit.
On November 15, 2023 based on a letter from the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Deputy for Macroeconomic and Financial Coordination No.
PK.
EKON/11/2023, the Financing Policy Committee for MSMEs decided to adjust the BRI KUR ceiling to remain at IDR194.40 trillion, and the target for new KUR debtors in 2023 for BRI was at least 1,363,225 debtors.
BRI’s Micro KUR distribution in 2023 was IDR140.2 trillion below the Government’s target of IDR194.40 trillion, this was because BRI focused on growing Kupedes (shifting back to Kupedes) in 2023.
Micro and Small Enterprises Funding  Program (PUMK) The implementation of the Social and Environmental Responsibility  program carried out in the form of financing to MSEs is called the MSEs Funding Program (PUMK) or in previous years it was called the Partnership Loan Program.
This MSEs funding (PUMK) is a Government policy implemented by all SOEs with the aim that SOEs, in addition to carrying out their business operations, also carries out social duties as a coach for micro and small businesses in the form of access to capital and assistance so that in the end they can be independent or switch to KUR or commercial loans.
The MSEs Funding Program is provided strictly for productive business purposes in an effort to empower Micro and Small Enterprises.
On the internal side of BRI, there is a change in the business model  of the MSEs Funding Program in 2021 with the previous year’s partnership loan.
Until 2020, partnership loans were under the Small and Medium Directorate, with the following business model:- Customers in the partnership loan segment were business entrepreneurs who were feasible but not yet bankable.
- The loan initiative was carried out by the RM Program.
- The maximum partnership loan ceiling at that time was IDR75 million.
According to Minutes of Handover No.
B.10-SSM/01/2021 Dated January 15, 2021, for Partnership Loans currently referred to as the MSEs Funding Program (PUMK) realized starting in 2021 and was the responsibility of the Micro Directorate, with the following business model:- MSEs Funding Program segment customers are business entrepreneurs who were feasible but not yet bankable who met the MSEs Funding Program requirements.
- The MSEs Funding Program was distributed through the BRI Unit which was initiated by the Loan analysts.
- The maximum ceiling for MSEs Funding Program was IDR50 million/debtor.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 265 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance The MSEs Funding Program became a journey so that MSEs  Funding Program’s fostered partners could later become entry level KUR debtors so that in the future their business could continue to grow and could become a potential pipe line for commercial loans.
Distribution of the MSEs Funding Program as of December 31, 2022 reached 15,176 fostered partners, with a nominal value of IDR259.8 billion.
Meanwhile, the total distribution of MSEs Funding Program in 2023 reached IDR872.6 billion with a total of 30,871 fostered partners.
Social Assistance (BANSOS) The Ministry of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia collaborates with BRI in distributing Social Assistance, this collaboration is based on Presidential Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 63 of 2017 concerning Non-Cash Distribution of Social Assistance.
In 2023 there will be 3 (three) types of social assistance distributed, including: 1.
Program Keluarga Harapan Social Assistance (PKH Social Assistance)  Distributed to 3.24 million Beneficiary Families (KPM) with total assistance of IDR9.12 trillion. 2.
Basic Food Assistance   Distributed to 5.41 million Beneficiary Families (KPM) with total assistance of IDR12.65 trillion. 3.
El Nino Direct Cash Assistance (BLT)  Distributed to 5.1 million Beneficiary Families (KPM) with total assistance of IDR2 trillion.
So the total aid distributed from the 3 (three) types of aid (PKH Social Assistance, Basic Food Social Assistance and El Nino BLT) is IDR23.8 trillion.
FINANCE DIRECTORATE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY The Finance Directorate has an important role in running the BRI organization, including preparing corporate strategy and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), fulfilling the core responsibilities of financial functions starting from the budget planning process to reporting accuracy, managing assets and liabilities, as well as managing subsidiary business strategies to encourage optimization of Subsidiary Entity contributions.
In line with this, during 2023 BRI has recorded positive performance amidst uncertain global economic conditions as demonstrated by achieving good financial performance and maintained bank health figures.
This financial performance was reflected in the achievement of the Company’s financial targets such as profit, Pre-Provision Operating Profit/PPOP (nominal and growth yoy), Return on Equity (ROE), Loan at Risk (LAR), and other financial performance.
In addition, BRI is currently managing 10 (ten) subsidiaries  as part of the BRI Group conglomerate which is also showing positive performance.
This condition is indicated by the growth of subsidiary assets which grew by 10.15% yoy or had a composition of 9.62% of total consolidated assets, in addition to that, aggregate subsidiary profits were able to grow by 39.65% yoy or had a composition equivalent to 12.09 % of total consolidated profit recorded was higher than the previous period of 10.18%.
The proud performance of the BRI Group provides a positive signal for the market so that by the end of 2023, BRI’s market capitalization could reach IDR 867.7 trillion, growing by 15.9% yoy.
All of BRI’s target achievements cannot be separated from the implementation of good budgeting and performance management processes and governance, including the determination of Key Performance Indicators.
The reliability of financial reports continues to be refined, demonstrated by the maintenance of ISO 9001:2015 standard certification in Audit Surveillance for Design of Accounting Policy and Accounting Control, Preparation and Verification of Published Financial Statements, Management Accounting and Analysis, Tax Policy and Operation, Internal and External Reporting.
In addition, profitability assessments were more granular down  to the product level, making every element at BRI increasingly focused on achieving performance.
Product management was carried out in an adaptive and innovative manner by considering aspects of consumer protection and strengthening risk management in the planning, launching, monitoring and product evaluation processes.
Furthermore, the Finance Directorate also played a role in developing a more robust organizational structure and job description as enablers in achieving BRI’s goals.
To improve the quality of the role and responsibilities of the Finance Directorate, during 2023, internal strategic initiatives had also been implemented that focused on strengthening enablers’ capabilities and improving business processes.

PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 291 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance Ability to Pay Debt and Receivable  Collectibility Ability to Pay Debt The ability to pay debt is reflected in the Bank’s liquidity and  solvency.
With regard to bonds issued, the ability to pay debts is reflected in the smooth payment of interest and the ranking of bonds.
The Company has a policy regarding the fulfillment of creditor  rights stated in each Loan Agreement between BRI and debtors.
The agreement includes the rights and obligations of both parties, such as transparency of financial reports to creditors.
The Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt   (Bank Liquidity) The liquidity ratio is a comparison between loans and deposits (Loan  to Deposit Ratio or LDR).
BRI’s LDR ratio in December 2023 was 84.73% (bank only), an increase compared to the LDR in 2022 which was 79.17% (bank only), indicating that banking liquidity conditions were tightening in line with Indonesia’s economic growth amidst the global economic slowdown.
This is in line with banking liquidity conditions which are starting to tighten in line with the recovery and improvement of the Indonesian economy.
Apart from that, the trend of BRI’s LDR increasing is also due to BRI’s contribution in growing loans above the growth of the industry.
In accordance with Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number  20/4/PBI/2018 dated April 3, 2018, banks must maintain a RIM ratio of 84% to 94%.
In the RIM calculation, securities issued and administered by the Indonesian Securities Center Custodian (KSEI) and not owned by the bank are taken into account for at least 2 (two) months before the report date and corporate bonds held.
The RIM calculation is also refined with PBI number 21/12/PBI/2019 effective on December 2, 2019 by taking into account offshore loans as a funding component.
BRI’s RIM ratio in 2023 showed 91.36% (bank only), an increase compared to 2022 which was 83.23% (bank only).
The increase in BRI’s RIM ratio in 2023 was influenced by a higher increase in assets, while there was a decrease in TPF.
In order to increase short-term liquidity resilience, BRI manages  the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is the ratio between High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and total net cash outflow for the next 30 (thirty) days under conditions crisis.
In 2023, BRI’s LCR could be maintained at 161.64% (bank only).
By achieving this LCR, BRI can be successful in maintaining its liquidity adequacy ratio well above the minimum limit of 100%.
Meanwhile, in order to maintain long-term liquidity resilience, BRI measures the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which is a comparison between available stable funding and required stable funding.
In 2023 BRI’s NSFR was at 135.17%, with this achievement BRI has succeeded in maintaining long-term stable funding adequacy above 100%.
The Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt   (Bank Solvability) The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) reflects the Bank’s ability to mitigate  risks that may occur in carrying out its business processes.
In 2023, BRI’s CAR recorded at 25,23% (bank only) and 27,27% (consolidated).
The CAR ratio is above BRI’s minimum capital requirement according to BRI’s Risk Profile which refers to the risk profile scorecard assessment, namely 9.46%.
With a capital adequacy ratio that is high, BRI is able to anticipate all the main risks that occur in bank management, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk.
Ability to Pay Debt from Issued Securities The ability to pay debts can also be reflected based on the rating of the securities issued by the Bank, namely Bonds.
Securities issued are routinely assessed by rating agencies to support the suitability of securities.
The quality of securities is largely determined by the ability of the issuing company to pay its securities at maturity and the ability to pay interest or coupons during the period of issuance of the securities.

Other Financial Ratios Rentability Ratio In the banking industry, the profitability ratio is generally  measured using the rate of return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and net interest income margin (Net Interest Margin/NIM).
BRI was able to record a positive profitability performance during 2023.

RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) BRI ROE balance sheet in 2023 reached 18.25% (bank only) and 19.95% (consolidated), respectively capable of growing 149 bps and 232 bps on an annual basis.

QUALITATIVE Scope and Definition of Matured Claims and Impaired Claims Matures Claims are all Matures Claims more than 90 (ninety) days, both for principal payments and/or interest payments or debtors who are in default.
Bills that are impaired in value are bills that experience a condition where an adverse event occurs (objective evidence) as a result of one or more events that occur after the loan is granted which has an impact on the debtor’s ability to pay in the future.
All Mature Claims more than 90 days old are included in the bill as having an impairment value.
Use of forward-looking information  The Bank uses forward-looking information in assessing whether there has been a significant increase in Credit Risk and measuring expected Loan losses.
Based on advice from the Risk Management Committee, economic experts and consideration of various actual information and external estimates, the Bank formulates a basic view (base case) regarding the movement of relevant economic variables in the future as well as estimates of other scenarios that may occur.
This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of possible outcomes.
External information includes economic data and forecasts published by, such as government bodies and selected private sector analysts and academics.
The basic view (base case) is used in strategic planning and budgeting.
The other scenarios reflect more optimistic outcomes and more pessimistic outcomes.
Measurement of Expected Loan Losses  The main inputs in measuring expected loan losses are the following variables:- Probability of Default (PD) - Loss of Given Default (LGD) - Exposure at Default (EAD) These parameters generally come from internally developed statistical models and other historical data.
These parameters are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information.
The PD estimate is an estimate as of a specific date, calculated  based on a statistical rating model, and assessed using ratings adjusted for various categories of debtor and exposure.
This statistical model is based on internally compiled data consisting of quantitative, qualitative factors and forward-looking estimates.
LGD is the amount of loss if a payment default occurs.
LGD  parameters are estimated historically based on the recovery rate of claims against defaulting debtors.
LGD is also observed by considering cash collateral which is an integral part of the outstanding financial assets as well as costs incurred in the recovery process.
EAD represents the estimated exposure in the event of default.
The EAD of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount.
For loan commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD includes the amount that has been drawn, as well as the potential future amount to be drawn, estimated based on historical observations.

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding MRK Techniques (CRC) In calculating credit risk RWA using a standard approach, the Bank  considers the use of Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques (Enterprise Risk Management-ERM) in accordance with FSA regulations.
The ERM techniques used by the Bank are the ERM-Collateral technique and the ERM-Guarantee or Credit Insurance technique.
The ERM-Collateral technique used is collateral in the form of cash (cash collateral) stored at the Bank and gold stored at the Subsidiary.
Meanwhile, the ERM-Guarantee or Credit Insurance technique is used for loan guaranteed by credit insurance from an Insurance Company with SOEs status.
Loans guaranteed by an insurance company which is a Bank Subsidiary is not counted as a guarantor in the ERM technique because it is a party affiliated with the Bank.
Collateral is tied to mortgage rights, power of attorney to sell, current accounts, savings, time deposits or other collateral generally accepted by banks as well as collateral in the form of gold (subsidiaries).  2.
Determining the value of collateral must be based on considerations of appraisal, binding, control, security and utilization. 3.
Collateral appraisal must be carried out objectively, honestly, responsibly and present a fair value.  4.
Collateral reviews are carried out to see the adequacy of collateral compared to the debtor’s total obligations, including:a.
Collateral condition at the time of review b.
Securing collateral (storage, binding and validity of collateral) d.
Other information relevant to assessing collateral adequacy 5.
The collateral review period is carried out as stated in the loan terms and conditions, but must be carried out at least once a year along with the loan review as regulated in each business sector.
The collateral review period can be set differently if specifically regulated by the regulator (BI, FSA or other related agencies).
For the purposes of calculating RWA, specifically for consumer loans backed by residential homes, collateral valuation must be carried out periodically for a minimum of 30 (thirty) months.

In addition to the standard method above, currently BRI also  calculates market risk using an internal method with a Value at Risk (VaR) calculation which showed a value that describes the maximum potential loss experienced by the Bank as a result of market movements that affected the Bank’s risk exposure in normal market conditions with a 99% confidence level.
The methodology used in calculating VaR currently used the historical VaR method.

In calculating interest rate risk, BRI applies guidelines in  accordance with SEOJK number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 concerning “Implementation of Risk Management and Risk Measurement Standard Approaches for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book for Commercial Banks”.
The method used by banks in measuring IRRBB Risk is as follows:1.
Measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity or ∆EVE, namely a method that measures the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of Bank equity; And 2.
Measurement based on changes in net interest income or ∆NII, which is a method that measures the impact of changes in interest rates on Bank income.

The risk of movement in BRI interest rates occurs because asset interest rates adjust more slowly than liability interest rates.
This risk is due to BRI’s asset composition which is dominated by fixed interest rates and has longer repricing maturities.
In mitigating IRRBB risk, BRI formulates a strategy for managing the impact of interest rate movements through the Asset and Liability Management  (ALCO) and Risk Management Committee (RMC) committees.
ALCO is held every month to discuss asset and liability management strategies, including balanced pricing, assets allocation, funding mix, gap management and capital management.
RMC is carried out regularly every month with discussion of updated market conditions, market risk profiles and the latest risk issues.
BRI calculates IRRBB quarterly using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) methods.
The EVE method used a long-term  perspective in calculating the sensitivity of interest rates to BRI Tier 1 capital.
This EVE method has been in accordance with the guidelines from the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan.
Meanwhile, the NII method applies a short-term perspective in calculating the sensitivity of interest rates to BRI’s estimated income in the next year.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 339 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance Qualitative Analysis The scenario used in calculating IRRBB was as follows: a.
Parallel Down (400 bps) c.
Short Rate Up (500 bps) f.
Short Rate Down (500 bps) In calculating IRRBB, BRI applies the following main modeling and parametric assumptions:a.
Cash flow calculations, instruments with floating interest rates use risk free sourced from Government Bonds IDR and Government Bonds USD.
The margin used was sourced from the average margin of each instrument.
Meanwhile, instruments with fixed interest rates used the effective interest rate as the basis for determining cash flow.
Non Maturity Deposit (NMD) accounts consisting of current accounts and savings were placed in the overnight time bucket, 3 - 4 year time bucket and 4 - 5 year time bucket in accordance with the maximum caps determined by the regulator.
NMD placed in the longest time bucket becomes a BRI core fund which has a lower interest rate sensitivity than non-core funds placed in the overnight time bucket.
Determining prepayment risk based on historical data according to loan segments and products within a period considered adequate.
The baseline calculation of the prepayment percentage is the average of the total loan balances paid off before maturity to the total loan balances in each segment.
Meanwhile, in determining early redemption, the method uses a historical approach to the report position to determine the deposit balance paid off before maturity within a certain period of time against the total deposit balance for the current month.
Apart from modeling prepayment risk and early redemption, BRI also determines internal modeling for NPL accounts.
Commercial Retail NPL with a maximum ceiling of IDR5 billion was placed in a time bucket of 3.5 years.
Meanwhile, Medium Corporate NPLs with a ceiling above IDR5 billion were placed in the 3 year time bucket.
NPL accounts were non-rate where the estimated cash flow did not take interest into account.
IRRBB calculations used rupiah and USD.
Foreign currencies other than these currencies were aggregated into the USD calculation.
Qualitative Analysis Current accounts and savings are savings that do not have a term and contractually have an overnight maturity.
Meanwhile, behaviorally, BRI places current and savings accounts in the overnight time bucket, 3 - 4 year time bucket and 4 - 5 year time bucket.
Distribution of BRI Non Maturity Deposits according to the time period of December 31, 2023:a.
Current Account; Overnight time bucket (61.51%), 3 - 4 year time bucket (29.15%) and 4 - 5 year time bucket (9.33%).
Savings; Overnight time bucket (18.66%) and 4 - 5 year time bucket (81.34%).

The risk of movement in BRI interest rates occurs because asset interest rate adjustments are slower than liability interest rate adjustments due to BRI’s asset composition being dominated by fixed interest rates and having longer repricing maturities. 2 In mitigating IRRBB risk, BRI formulates a strategy for managing the impact of interest rate movements through the Assets and Liability Management (ALCO) committee and the Integrated Risk Management Committee (RMC).
ALCO is held every month to discuss asset and liability management strategies, including balanced pricing, assets allocation, funding mix, gap management and capital management.
Meanwhile, Integrated RMC is carried out bank wide with subsidiary companies to discuss market risk profile assessments and the latest risk issues. 3 BRI calculates the Consolidated IRRBB semi-annually using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) methods.
The EVE method uses a long-term perspective in calculating interest rate sensitivity to BRI Tier 1 capital and has been adjusted to the guidelines from the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan.
Meanwhile, the NII method uses a short-term perspective in calculating the sensitivity of interest rates to BRI’s estimated income in one year. 4 The scenario used in calculating BRI’s IRRBB is as follows:a.
Parallel Down (400 bps) c.
Short Rate Up (500 bps) f.
Short Rate Down (500 bps) 5 a.
In calculating cash flows, instruments for assets and liabilities with floating interest rates use risk free sources from Government Bonds IDR and Government Bonds USD.
The margin used comes from the average margin of each instrument segment.
Asset and liability instruments with fixed interest rates use the yield reference charged on the instrument as the basis for determining cash flow.
Non Maturity Deposit (NMD) accounts, namely current and savings accounts placed on an overnight period, a time scale of 3 - 4 years and 4 - 5 years in accordance with the maximum caps determined by the regulator.
NMD placed on the longest time scale is a BRI core fund which has a lower interest rate sensitivity than non-core funds placed on an overnight time scale.
Determining prepayment risk based on historical data according to loan segments and products within a period that is considered adequate.
The baseline calculation of the prepayment percentage is the average of the total loan balances paid off before maturity to the total loan balances per each segment.
Meanwhile, in determining early redemption, use a historical approach with adequate data sources and other relevant approaches.
The baseline percentage used in early redemption is the deposit balance that is paid off before maturity within a certain period of time against the total deposit balance for the current month.
IRRBB calculations use rupiah and USD.
All currencies other than these currencies are aggregated into the USD calculation.
Quantitative Analysis 1 Current accounts and savings are savings that do not have a term and contractually have an overnight maturity.
Behaviorally, BRI consolidatedly places current and savings accounts as of December 31 2023 in 3 separate time buckets, namely:a.
Overnight (non corefund), Current Account (61.53%) and Savings (18.77%) b. 3 - 4 years (corefund), Current Account (29.16%) and Savings (0.03%) c. 4 - 5 years (corefund), Current Account (9.31%) and Savings (81.20%) In addition to disclosing IRRBB exposure, exchange rate risk disclosure  is also carried out.
Exchange rate risk arises due to movements in market exchange rates that are contrary to BRI’s foreign exchange position.
Exchange rate risk originates from assets and liabilities on the Bank’s balance sheet in foreign currency, foreign exchange transactions with customers and counterparties which result in open positions in foreign currency, as well as structural positions in foreign currency due to capital investments.
BRI managed exchange rate risk by monitoring and managing Net Foreign Exchange Position (PDN) in accordance with risk limits and regulations with the actual position as of the end of December 2023.
BRI’s absolute PDN was 0.76% of capital.

- Unrestricted assets amounted to IDR30.86 trillion or 7.56% of total assets.
Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk management is described as follows: 1.
BRI manages liquidity risk so that it can fulfill all agreed financial obligations in a timely manner, and can maintain adequate and optimal levels of liquidity.
The formulation of the level of risk to be taken (risk appetite) and risk tolerance (risk tolerance) related to liquidity risk has been carried out in line with the bank’s overall strategic and business targets.
BRI periodically reviews the risk appetite statement and risk limit parameters for corporate level (bank wide) as stipulated in the Circular Letter concerning Risk-Based Bank Soundness Assessment of PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero), Tbk.
The liquidity risk management strategy is in line with the level of risk to be taken and risk tolerance in accordance with RBB 2023 - 2025, that BRI manages liquidity risk so that it can fulfill every financial obligation that has been determined in a timely manner and can maintain adequate and optimal levels of liquidity.
In managing liquidity risk, the Treasury Business Division is responsible for managing national liquidity, while the Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division is responsible for compiling and reviewing liquidity risk management policies.
Funding Strategy a.
Funding Diversification  Carried out by taking into account the characteristics of the source and term of funding as well as the Bank’s Business Plan, taking into account the counterparty, conditions for the existence of collateral, type of instrument, type of currency, as well as the geographical location of the funding source market.
Stabilization of Fund Growth  This is maintaining the stability of Third Party Funds so that the growth trend is positive, including through pricing strategies, issuing and/or developing savings products, increasing quality marketing that supports the stability of fund growth, as well as reviewing product development and marketing policies.
Evaluation and Analysis of Funding Strategy  This activity is carried out periodically at ALCO meetings/other related meetings by paying attention to changes in internal and external factors.
Treasury Business Division, Asset and Liabilities Management Desk together with related divisions identify, monitor and evaluate the main factors that influence BRI’s ability to obtain funding, including alternative sources of funds that can strengthen capacity to survive crisis conditions.
Maintain Market Access  Maintaining rupiah and foreign exchange market access includes: expanding the market for asset sales or increasing the number of standby facilities with/without collateral, actively transacting in the market in line with funding strategies, and maintaining good relationships with fund providers so that funding sources can be properly diversified. 3.
Liquidity risk identification activities are carried out by each operational unit by identifying liquidity risks originating from banking products and activities that can affect the source and use of funds, both in asset and liability positions and administrative accounts as well as other risks that can increase Liquidity Risk (for example credit risk, market risk and operational risk), both for current and future risk exposures.
Liquidity risk is measured, among other things, periodically using cash flow projections, maturity profiles, liquidity ratios and liquidity stress testing.
Monitoring and controlling risk measurement results is carried out by the Treasury Business Division (example: GWM monitoring, quarterly evaluation of national cash ratio achievement, LHBU and LBBU reporting) and the Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division (example: liquidity coverage ratio, net stable funding ratio) to monitor compliance with established limits.
Monitoring results and liquidity risk are presented in the form of periodic reports (liquidity risk dashboard) which are submitted to BRI’s Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners.
Regarding monitoring results that show indications that liquidity risk has the potential to increase, recommendations are made for mitigating liquidity risk exposure as well as decisions on follow-up actions to control it.
A liquidity risk profile dashboard is prepared periodically or can be adjusted to suit business strategy needs.
The information system technology used to provide the latest and timely information regarding liquidity at BRI is BI-RTGS, BRINets, BRISIM, Treasury and Market Risk System, SKNBI, Swift, LHBU and LBBU Portals, as well as other applications developed for monitoring BRI assets and liabilities. 4.
Contingency Funding Plana.
Contingency funding plan (emergency funding plan) is a plan and strategy for dealing with crisis conditions that impact liquidity to ensure BRI’s ability to obtain the required funding sources in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
The contingency funding plan has been regulated and adjusted in Decree Number PP. 11-DIR/MPE/12/2020 Chapter 9 which regulates the Objectives, General Provisions, Methodology and Authority and Responsibilities for implementing the Contingency Funding Plan.
CFP Trials are carried out regularly at least once a year and are coordinated by the ALM Desk as ALCO Secretary.
Testing of emergency funding plans is carried out using a walk on paper based method, where all business units related to emergency funding (Liquidity Crisis Management Team) gather to run test scenarios on paper without carrying out transactions on the financial market.
The Market, Portfolio and Enterprise Risk Division monitors the parameters in the Contingency Funding Plan which are contained in the daily liquidity dashboard. 5.
Stress Testing Liquidity Riska.
Stress testing is carried out to measure BRI’s ability and resilience to meet liquidity needs in crisis conditions (stress conditions).
Liquidity risk stress testing is carried out in accordance with BRI’s internal policies and needs and/or regulator requests.
Stress Testing is also reported periodically to the Board of Directors through the Risk Management Committee (RMC).
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 363 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance c.
The implementation of stress testing is carried out  using stress test scenarios which are developed by considering business aspects and the level of risk managed by BRI.
The stress test results show the implications of each scenario used to show BRI’s liquidity resilience, including those expressed as the number of days (liquidity surviving days). 6.
Funding Concentrationa.
BRI sets a limit on the ratio of the 50 largest depositors to third party funds with a limit of >21.95% - 23.28% on a moderate risk profile, > 24.61% on a high risk profile.
BRI sets the Rupiah Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) parameter limit with a limit of 94.32% - 97.22% on a moderate risk profile and >98.67% on a high risk profile.
BRI sets the parameter limit for the Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) with a limit of 85.99% - 88.54% for a moderate risk profile and >91.09% for a high risk profile.7.
Maturity Profilea.
The potential liquidity risk that BRI will face in the future is measured through liquidity gap analysis, which is a projection of excess and shortage of liquidity based on the maturity of assets and liabilities, after taking into account the need for business expansion.
This information is taken into consideration in planning and managing liquidity, including business expansion needs.
By implementing effective liquidity management, it is hoped that BRI can minimize liquidity risk while increasing the stability of the banking system as a whole.
BRI sets a maturity profile limit of < 1 year (assets due < 1 year/ liabilities due < 1 year) with a limit of > 88.60% - 76.00% in the moderate to high risk profile and < 63.40% in the risk profile high.
Maturity profile is reported regularly by bucket division- ≤ 1 week - >1 - 2 week - >2 week - 1 month - >1 - 3 month - >3 - 6 month - >6 - 12 month - >12 month Operational Risk QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 1 The preparation of BRI’s operational risk management framework refers to OJK Regulations Implementation of Commercial Bank Risk Management  No. 18/ POJK.03/2016 dated 16 March 2016 concerning Implementation of Commercial Bank Risk Management and best practices.

In this regard, an Operational Risk Management Unit was in managing operational risk at BRI.
Operational Risk Management Unit was directly responsible to the Director of Risk Management, and Operational Risk Management Unit consisted of the Digital Risk Division and Operational Risk Division which were divisions of the DOR Division, with respective approvals:1.
The Digital Risk Division was formed in accordance with the Decree of the Board of Directors No. 628-DIR/PPM/10/2021 dated September 1, 2021. 2.
The Operational Risk Division was formed in accordance with the Decree of the Directors No. 697-DIR/PPM/11/2021 dated November 15, 2021.
Along with the development of digital transactions and services and to anticipate increasing cyber threats, the Digital Risk Division has the task of managing digital risks, including formulating policies, implementing risk management processes, and monitoring and evaluating digital risks and their control throughout the Bank’s activities.
The Operational Risk Division focuses on risk management in the operational sector which includes developing and implementing an operational risk management framework, preparing policies and implementing Business Continuity Management (BCM) and SMK3, and controlling fraud.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 364 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Implementation of operational risk management was strengthened by the establishment of a Regional Risk Management (RRM) Department  organization as part of the Operational Risk Division.
The RRM Department has the main task of maintaining the portfolio and credit quality as well as ensuring the implementation of operational risk management and compliance at the regional level.
Taking this into account, the organizational structure of the RRM Department consists of an RRM Head who supervises Risk Management and Compliance (RMC) and a Credit Risk Analyst (CRA).
Meanwhile, RMC which is located in the regional office supervises Branch Risk and Compliance (BRC) and BRI Unit Risk and Compliance (URC) which is located in Branch Offices and BRI Units.
Apart from that, to strengthen the implementation of GCG and the implementation of POJK No.39/POJK.03/2019 dated December 19, 2019  concerning the Implementation of Anti-Fraud Strategies, in accordance with Directors’ Decree No. 697-DIR/PPM/11/2021 dated November 15, 2021, the Bank established a Fraud Risk Management and Recovery Desk which has the task of preparing anti-fraud strategy policies, ensuring the implementation of anti-fraud strategies which include prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and sanctions, as well as monitoring, evaluation and follow-up with the aim of preventing the risk of fraud incidents and carrying out recovery efforts for fraud losses.
The current organizational structure of the Operational Risk Division is as f ollows: Operational Risk Divition Division Head Regional Risk Management   Department Regional Risk Management  HeadFraud Management   & Recovery Disk Desk Head •  Fraud Strategy & Analysis •  Fraud Governance & SAF  terintegrasi •  Fraud Detection & System Support •  Fraud Response & Remediation •  Fraud InvestigationBCM & K3   Department Department Head • BCM Policy, Implementation & Monitoring •  K3 Policy, Implementation & MonitoringOperational Risk Strategy   Department Department Head •  Ops Risk Policy & Strategy •  Ops Risk Analysis & Culture, Implementation •  Ops Risk Support (RRM, RMC & UKLN) •  Ops Risk Support System & Technology •  Ops Risk CRA Support BRC Kanca BRI Unit Risk & ComplianceRMC BRCCRA In order to implement the three line model, the form of collaboration with the Internal Audit Unit (IAU) as the third line model has an important  meaning in implementing operational risk management.
The Internal Audit Unit functions as an enabler tasked with providing assurance in the implementation of risk management.
Apart from that, IAU also contributes in providing support in the form of tools to make it easier for the RRM Team to carry out control testing and fraud detection.
Furthermore, SKMRO as the second line was also asked to provide data and information sources in the form of risk maps to assist the IAU in carrying out risk-based audits.  3 Explanation of the measurement system for operational risk (covering systems and data used to calculate operational risk in order to estimate the capital charge for operational risk).
In connection with the Bank’s obligation to estimate capital charges for operational risk by calculating Operational Risk RWA using the Standard Approach in accordance with SEOJK No.6/SEOJK.03/2020, BRI carried out measurement and calculation of operational risk as a part of the operational risk management pr ocess, namely identification, measurement, control, and monitoring.
The operational risk management process was carried out in accordance with the governance set out in the operational risk management framework and used tools in accordance with regulatory provisions and best practices.
The process of measuring and calculating operational risk was carried out through the following activities:a.
Penilaian Risk and Control Self Assessment (RCSA)  Risk and Control Self Assessment became a qualitative and predictive risk management tool used to identify and measure risk based on the dimensions of impact and likelihood.
RCSA in BRI was implemented at the BRI Head Office Division/Desk, regional offices, special branch offices, Overseas Business Units, regional internal audit, regional campus, branch offices that also represented BRI Units, sub-branch offices and BRI Prioritas service centers.
Risk and Control Self Assessment was intended to assist business units in independently identifying and measuring operational risk in every operational and business activity, including monitoring and determining corrective steps/follow-up future plans.
Risk issue and control updates on RCSA were carried out by considering BRI’s business developments which included the implementation of new products and or activities, new market segments and business competition, changes in internal/external regulations, and other changes that affected BRI’s risk exposure.
The assessment was carried out by considering Incident Management/Loss Event Database data, Main Key Risks/ Key Risk Indicators (KRI) and Audit Reports (LHA).
RCSA was carried out periodically every semester, and the frequency increased if there was a significant change in risk exposure.
Penilaian Kecukupan Pengelolaan Risiko Produk Bank Baru (PBB)  The application of the risk management process for each New Bank Products issuance plan at BRI was carried out through the implementation of New Bank Products Risk Self Assessment by the Product Owner and requesting an adequacy assessment of New Bank Products risk management from the Risk Management Unit to then be recommended to the BRI Risk Management Director in order to obtain approval.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 365 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS c.
Recording Operational Risk Losses in the Loss Event Database (LED)  LED BRI included the process of recording loss event data for each type of financial and non-financial loss which included actual loss, potential  loss including corrective measures and incident handling.
Based on the loss event data on LEDs, an analysis of loss events could be performed based on the cause, functional activity, event category (event type) and BRI’s business lines.
This information system could be used to determine preventive risk control measures based on documenting incident handling/settlement processes both from a non-financial perspective, financial losses and loss recovery as well as litigation processes.
In order to calculate the capital charge and Operational RWA, BRI used the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) method implemented since 2010 in accordance with regulatory provisions.
However, BRI made preparations for implementing the Standard Approach Minimum Operational Risk Capital Measurement (MMRO) guided by the Basel III Framework.
Provisions for Operational Risk RWA with a standard approach are regulated through Directors’ Circular Letter No.
SE.66 DIR/MPE/12/2022 Book 2 concerning Operational RWA Calculations.
Key Risk Indicator Monitoring (KRI)  KRI was a Risk Management tool in the form of a quantitative indicator that could provide early information on increasing or decreasing risk and or decreasing the effectiveness of controls against predetermined thresholds.
KRI could be leading or lagging.
Risk monitoring through KRI aimed to determine follow-up plans related to risk control so as to prevent or minimize the impact of losses.
BRI identified key risk indicators for all types of risk and established risk limits that reflected BRI’s risk appetite and conditions.
Identification of key risk indicators and determination of KRI thresholds was carried out using best judgment by considering BRI’s risk exposure and risk appetite.
The threshold determination involved internal audit, risk owners and other related units.
BRI’s main risk indicators were reflected in the bankwide risk profile report and regional office risk profile monitored regularly and reported to management every month.
Risk Assessment Plan (RAP)  RAP was a form of risk strategy preparation activity carried out by RRM with output in the form of a list of main risks, business unit priorities based on risk and risk control activity plans.
Disaster Threat Risk Assessment  BRI implemented Disaster Threat Risk Assessment as an implementation of Business Continuity Management (BCM) to protect the security and safety of employees’ lives, protect the lives of customers and other stakeholders within BRI’s operational units (disaster management plan), and maintain the continuity of business/operational activities.
most importantly, safeguarding BRI’s assets and having an adequate response in disruption/disaster situations (business continuity plan).
Disaster Threat Risk Assessment aimed to identify the resources needed in order to prepare for threats/disasters in each unit.
As one of the implementations of BCM, BRI already had guidelines for an Emergency Response Plan (ER Plan) and a Business Continuity Plan (BC Plan) policy for Critical Business Units. 4 Operational risk management was reported regularly to management, business unit heads, and other interested parties as a monitoring tool.
The ORD Division submitted operational risk reports, both mandatory and for internal reporting purposes.
The scope and form of operational risk management reports included: a.
Bank Operational Risk Profile  The Bank’s operational risk profile was submitted to Regulators, Directors and Commissioners on a quarterly basis coordinated by the MPE Division.
The operational risk profile included risk parameters which became the focus of monitoring the Bank’s operational risk exposure.
The Bank’s operational risk profile report was also submitted to the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and the Risk Management Oversight Committee b.
Regional Risk Profile  The regional risk profile contained parameters for 7 (seven) types of risk, one of which was operational risk.
The preparation of the operational risk profile was coordinated by RRM and submitted to the Regional Chief Executive Officer (RCEO) through the Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) forum every month.
Operational Risk News (OPEN)  OPEN was submitted to the Director of Risk Management and other Directors on a monthly basis.
The scope of OPEN included operational risk profile reports, achievement of risk appetite statements (RAS), incidents of human error and fraud incidents, as well as improvements to implemented controls, risk management forum activities, BCM and OHS activities, regional risk management activities, risk assessment of Bank products New (UN), RRM SMART, and external event information.
BRC/URC risk analysis report  The BRC/URC risk analysis report contained a list of control weaknesses that occured in the Unit according to the results of the verification conducted by the BRC/URC.
This report was submitted by BRC/URC to Business Unit Leaders held at the Business Unit MR Forum every month. 5 The risk mitigation process became part of the risk management process, namely risk control.
Risk control was carried out in order to prevent risk events and minimize the impact of risks.
Risk mitigation measures were adjusted according to the results of an analysis of the causes of events or potential risks.
In accordance with this, risk mitigation was generally grouped into 3 (three) subs, namely:a.
PeopleMitigation of the people aspect was carried out in terms of quantity and quality, including:• Determine and review the need for employee formation to carry out business processes in business units.
• Establish requirements, mechanisms, and background checks in the employee recruitment process.
• Carry out the fulfillment of employee formation in the Business Unit.
• Improve worker capabilities, among others by:- Education and training of workers in accordance with the position level.
- Review curriculum and educational methods.
- Provide certification for workers with certain specialists.
• Encouraging the implementation of risk culture through risk culture internalization programs, including:- Culture Activation Program (CAP)  Each business unit has established a CAP to form the behavior needed to achieve KPIs prudently through the activities specified in the CAP.
- Building Risk Awareness of Workers in Business Units  Risk Management Unit routinely delivers risk awareness media in the form of letters, infographic media, webinars, podcasts, e-learning, official Bank social media accounts and email/WA/SMS blasts.
- Empowering Risk Officer  The involvement of the Risk Officer as the Transformation Driving Team is required in internalizing and ensuring that the implementation of risk culture is implemented.
Thus, the RM function is strengthened through adjusting operational procedures and upgrading knowledge and technical skills through education/socialization.
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 366 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS - Early Detection  The implementation of a risk culture needs to be supported by Early Warning System tools which can help mitigate or correct risk events  early.
- Business Process Review  Risk culture activities are reflected through the implementation of daily banking operational procedures.
Hence, it is necessary to review the adequacy of control over operational procedures.
Process Risk mitigation in the process aspect, namely:• Develop policies and standard operating procedures (SOP) for each product and activity of the Bank which includes business processes, internal control, and the duties and responsibilities of workers as makers, checkers, signers.
Each draft policy and SOP before being ratified must obtain an assessment of the adequacy of risk management from the Risk Management Unit.
• Risk mitigation was also carried out by transferring risk to a third party, namely an insurance company that bore the Bank’s losses or to a labor service provider which of course had taken into account the principles of bona fide and integrity of the service provider as regulated in the Cooperation Agreement (PKS) in every cooperation with third parties.
Technology In principle, digital risk control was closely related to the Bank’s efforts to secure its assets, including providing protection for customer data/information.
Digital risk management in IT management activities/IT services includes, but was not limited to:• Development, updating and deletion of electronic/digital banking services.
• Development, updating, and deletion of IT infrastructure (computing, network, satellite) and security.
• Development, renewal and deletion of the Bank’s internal services.
• Procurement of IT service providers.
• IT service provider by the Bank.
• IT operational activities.
• Development and/or review of Fraud Detection System (FDS) rules.
Furthermore, to strengthen digital risk control, each application development was accompanied by the Digital Risk Division.
Calculation of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA ) Operational Risk In accordance with SEOJK No. 6/SEOJK.03/2020, Calculation of Operational Risk RWA using the Standard Approach as of January 2023  has been implemented.

The purpose of the arrangement is to provide a detailed description of the implementation of the procurement work to the provider of the goods, which is binding and contains the terms and conditions that the parties must meet.
To speed up the process of procuring goods primarily by using  the direct purchase method and self-management following best practice without requiring an SPK, the procurement committee only needs to issue a Purchase Order (PO) or a letter of request for a quotation, or it is sufficient to prove it with a purchase receipt/ purchase receipt.
The general principle of procurement of goods within the company must refer to the guides of efficient, effective, competitive, transparent, fair and reasonable, accountability, standardization of goods, centralization, and decentralization.
These have been determined in the Company’s Budget Work Plan (RKAP).
Source of Funds The source of funds uses the budget within the BRI Company that has been allocated (breakdown) following the budget items specified in the Company’s Work Budget Plan (RKAP).
Denominated Currency and Planned Steps to  Hedge Risk from Foreign Currency Positions All procurement uses rupiah currency, and it is required that all  procurements, agreed in foreign currencies, will be adjusted in SPK and PKS to use rupiah currency.
Thus, BRI will not hedge due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 369 Management Discussion and Analysis  on Bank Performance The economies of developed countries, including the United  States and Europe, were projected to slow down due to a decline in manufacturing activity and consumption.
Meanwhile, China’s economy is relatively slow due to weak momentum in domestic consumption and the manufacturing industry, as well as in particular the ongoing crisis in the property sector.
This slowdown was driven by a decline in supply and demand side performance where industrial activity and global consumption slowed down overall.
Moreover, there were several risk factors (downside risk) predicted  to contribute to the global economic slowdown, including the trend of global inflation which was high even though it is in a slowing trend which caused monetary policy to remain relatively tight.
Apart from that, high geopolitical volatility has put pressure on the performance of financial markets and the global real sector, especially developing countries.
Global economic dynamics were predicted to also have an impact  on the Indonesian economy.
In 2024, it is predicted that the Indonesian will grow, although at a relatively slow rate (4.81%-5.10%).
Global economic uncertainty and high geopolitical tensions are predicted to cause the outlook for Indonesian trade activity and foreign capital flows to be relatively limited and volatile.
As a result, the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate will remain relatively fragile and encourage Bank Indonesia to maintain the BI 7 days reverse repo (BI 7DRR) benchmark interest rate at a relatively high level.
Material Information and Facts After the Accountant’s Report Date Until the end of the Annual Report, there is no description of important events after the date of the accountant’s report, including their impact on future business performance and risks.
Details of Problems Arising During the Fiscal Year Which Affected the Business Activities of  SOEs  In 2023, there are no details of significant problems that arose during the financial year that affected BRI’s business activities.
Business Prospects and Future Strategies The international institution, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), projects that the global economy will slow down in 2024, deaccelerating the  economies of developed and developing countries.

Volatility of global financial markets and fluctuations in the Rupiah exchange rate can have an impact on the value of domestic financial assets and the quality of banking loans.
Meanwhile, the slowdown in global demand and the slowdown in the domestic economy lead to a slowdown in banking loans growth.
In 2024, it is predicted that loans growth will be in the range of 7.2%-8.6% yoy, a decrease compared to 2023 of 10.4%.
Meanwhile, banking deposits are projected to grow by 6.2%-7.0% yoy in 2024, a slight increase compared to 2023 of 3.8% yoy.
The challenging macroeconomic situation combined with increasingly tight competition in the banking industry means that BRI needs to respond with the right strategy to continue to increase BRI’s market share in the future.
Internally, BRI faces performance optimization challenges related to the Company’s capabilities in accelerating retail and consumer businesses, Subsidiary Entity businesses, as well as controlling costs.
BRI’s performance in general is supported by credit activities, so the ability to generate non-interest income needs to continue to be improved.
BRI’s innovation and exploration of new sources of growth  have implications for the Company’s increasingly complex business.
Internal dynamics and the business environment require BRI to be agile in responding to challenges so as to be careful in optimizing business opportunities both now and in the future.
Thus, oriented towards the company’s long-term aspirations, 2024-2026 for BRI will be a period of amplifying market control towards achieving BRI’s long-term aspirations in 2025 by: 1.
Improving business fundamentals and enablers,  2.
Expanding business scope (scope up) through development of supporting businesses (beyond banking),  3.
Increasing the scale (scale up) of new growth engine businesses, as well as  4.
Cohesive synergy between intra Group entities as an enabler of solid sustainable growth.
Based on these things, BRI has determined that business development will focus on: 1.
More productive management of Assets and Liabilities  Continuing stable and sustainable CASA accumulation, selective expansion in assets with high yields, as well as improving asset quality in the Micro and Small segments.2.
Diversify sources of growth  Encouraging stronger revenue generation through strengthening the capabilities of the Retail segment (Consumer, SME), focusing on integrating the UMI holding, as well as strengthening the business of Subsidiaries as a source of consolidated growth. 3.
Reliability of operational support  Focus on strengthening Human Capital competencies and digital capabilities, improving customer experience, risk management and data analytics, as well as operational excellence. 4.
Implementation of ESG principles  Committed to managing business in line with the principles of good business governance in order to provide positive value for the environment (deliver value beyond profit).
These strategic responses encourage BRI to continue to grow sustainably to realize BRI’s vision as “Most Valuable Banking Group in South East Asia & Champion of Financial Inclusion”.
Thus, strategic focus can run well and BRI can take advantage of  its strengths and opportunities, such as:1.
The largest and most widespread BRI network. 2.
BRI’s capabilities in micro business. 3.
Complete financial products and services as well as strong brand positioning in Indonesia. 4.
A large customer base which was added to by the formation of Ultra Micro Holding as one of BRI’s new sources of growth. 5.
Bank with strong capital 6.
Digitalization of loan processing 7.
First mover Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. 8.
Technological developments, digital trends, and revolutions in lifestyle and people’s behavior. 9.

BI 7 Days Rate 5.25 PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. 2023 Annual Report 374 BRI’s future asset growth will continue to be driven by loan  growth in the MSME segment.
The SME and Consumer segments are encouraged to become growth engines outside the Micro segment in line with BRI’s 2024 focus on strengthening capacity in the retail banking segment in order to build a retail ecosystem.
Non-loan assets are projected to grow lower as a result of the growing role of the loan business, especially MSMEs, which will increase, including optimizing portfolios to maximize profits.
On the liabilities side, deposit growth continues to increase, with the main driver being savings growth which focuses on increasing CASA.
BRI’s profitability in 2024 will come under pressure from  an increase in the Cost of Funds (CoF) and a decrease in the Net Interest Margin (NIM).
However, BRI is optimistic that BRI’s profitability will continue to grow, which comes from strengthening the growth of loans that provide high yields, increasing CASA, maximizing operational income such as FBI and Recovery, and efficiency in OHC supported by reducing provision costs in line with improving asset quality.
From several financial ratios, the quality of gross NPL in 2024 is directed to be better in line with efforts to improve asset quality and economic recovery.
CoF has increased to provide room for interest rate increases that will continue until 2024 and NIM will be maintained at the same level by focusing credit distribution on High Yield products.
Yield is optimized in line with the increase in BI7DRR.

Policy synergy between BI and the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) is also strengthened in order to maintain financial system stability and encourage credit/financing to the business world, especially in priority sectors.
Various policy steps taken by BI throughout 2023 have had a positive  impact on national banking.
In general, banking intermediation is quite good, although relatively slow compared to the position at the end of 2022.
Credit growth in October 2023 was recorded to have increased to 8.99% yoy from 8.96% yoy in the previous month.
However, this figure is lower than the position at the end of 2022 of 11.35% yoy.
On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Industry’s credit  growth also only grew by 7.47% until October 2023, lower than the same period last year of 9.80%.
Even though credit growth is in a slowing phase, credit quality is relatively well maintained and stable.
In October 2023, the gross non-performing loan (NPL) value was recorded to move steadily and was below 3%, namely 2.42%.
Meanwhile, banking industry liquidity is increasingly limited and tends to tighten.
Growth in Third Party Funds (DPK) slowed to 3.43% yoy in October 2023, from 6.54% yoy in the previous month.
Meanwhile, in terms of resilience, banking resilience remains well  maintained, this is reflected in strong capital and low credit risk.
The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was recorded at a high level of 27.86% in November 2023.
Credit risk also remains under control, reflected in the low non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 2,19% (gross) and 0,75% (net) in December 2023.
BI stress-test results show that national banking resilience remains strong in the face of global pressure.
BI will continue to strengthen policy synergies with KSSK in mitigating various risks that have the potential to disrupt financial system stability.
In response to the increase in BI’s benchmark interest rate and  monetary policy by the FED, BRI selectively adjusted its funding interest rates and credit interest rates (especially short-term credit).
However, for the Basic Credit Interest Rate (SBDK), as of December 2023, BRI’s SBDK has not undergone any changes with the following details: Table of Basic Credit Interest Rate (dalam %) Interest rateCorporate  LoansRetail Loans Micro LoansConsumer Credit Housing Loans   (Mortgage)Non-Housing Loans   (Non-Mortgage) Desember 2023 8.00% 8.25% 14.00% 7.25% 8.75% Prohibitions, Limitations and/or Significant Obstacles to the Legal Lending Limit  Between Banks and Other Entities in a Business Groups   In carrying out its business activities, BRI established a policy  that includes limits on providing funds to related parties in accordance with the Regulation of the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan of the Republic of Indonesia Number 32/POJK.03/2018 concerning Legal Lending Limits (BMPK) and Provision of Large Funds for Commercial Banks and POJK No. 38 /POJK.03/2019 concerning Amendments to POJK No. 32/POJK.03/2018 Concerning LLL and Provision of Large Funds for Commercial Banks.
Provision of Funds to Related Parties and  Large Amount of Funds One of the causes of the failure of the Bank’s business is the  Legal Lending Limit that is not supported by the Bank’s ability to manage the concentration of Legal Lending Limit effectively.
To reduce the potential for Bank business failure as a result of concentration on Legal Lending Limit, Banks are required to spread and diversify the portfolio of Legal Lending Limit, especially through limiting Legal Lending Limit, both to Related Parties and other than Related Parties in the amount of a certain percentage of Bank Capital or Core Capital (Tier 1) Banks, known as BMPK and Provision of Large Funds.
Furthermore, in order to increase Indonesia’s economic growth and national competitiveness, efforts are needed to encourage the banking intermediation function by providing concessions or exceptions in the application of LLL and Large Fund Providers while observing the principle of prudence.
