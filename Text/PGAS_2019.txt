The dynamics of the industry climate during the course  of 2019 which impacted the performance achievement  success of 2019 were attributed to the following factors: • PGN succeeded in responding to the competitive  natural gas commerce activities in several areas that  constitute PGN’s existing natural gas market which  includes the di RD II (Eastern Java) and other areas of  Western Java namely Bekasi, Karawang, Jakarta, Bogor,  Tangerang and Cilegon.
• PGN was able to respond to the policy issued by PT PLN  (Persero) in terms of power plant cost efficiency as well  as the electricity merit system policy, thus distribution  of PGN’s natural gas to PT PLN (Persero) as well as to  the private sector remains optimal.
• The Indonesian Government’s protection efforts to  maintain the national industry competitiveness for,  among others, the chemical and ceramics sectors.
The  Government has included the chemical industry in the  RIPIN 2015-2035 and issued Regulation of the Minister  of Finance Number 119/PMK.010/2018 on  Imposition  of Import Duty Tariff to Safeguard Imports of Ceramic  Tiles thus opening opportunities to domestic industries  to increase their productions. 152 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    151 20.0% -1.4% -7.5% -18.3%-3.8%15.7% -1.1% -2.6% -15.4%-8.4%-3.2%14.3% -1.2%8.4% -28.7%10.0% -20.0%0.0% -40.0%15.0% -10.0%5.0% -30.0%-5.0%  INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMER GROWTH 2018 - 2019 FoodChemicalBasic MetalWood Glass OthersCNGTextile CeramicFabricated MetalPaperCementPower PlantLifting Oil This increase of the sales volume is also triggered  by the increase of natural gas distribution pipelines  infrastructure which, in 2019, reached a length of 5,418  km, constituting a growth of 76 km or 1.4% compared to  2018’s length of 5,343 km.

This increase was primarily  contributed by a rise in the number of household  customer segment.
Performance of Transmission Business Segment At the end of 2019, the volume of natural gas transported  though PGN transmission pipes was 2,046 MMSCFD,  showing a decrease of 55 MMSCFD or -3% compared to  that of 2018 which was 2,101 MMSCFD.
The total volume  transmitted by PGN includes natural gas transmission through PGN’s Afiliates namely TGI and KJG.
In 2019,  TGI and KJG distributed  natural gas in the volume of,  respectively, 676 MMSCFD and 19 MMSCFD, showing  an increase of 22 MMSCFD for TGI and a decrease of 27  MMSCFD for KJG compared to that of 2018. 152 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    151 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference Discussion of the Increasing / Decreasing  Transmission Performance The transmission distribution volume has decreased due  to a decline in production in oil and natural gas fields  that represent the main supply source for shippers of   PT Pertamina Gas.
In addition, there has also been  a decrease of upstream supply distributed through  transmission pipelines of Kepodang – Tambak Lorok  operated by KJG.
Since the 4th quarter of 2019, KJG has  ceased the natural gas flow because of no supply of  natural gas from the Kepodang Field.

In 2019,  revenue from the distribution/commerce business  segment reached USD2,974 million showing a decrease  of 7% or equivalent to USD183 million compared to 2018  which was USD2,791 million.
This increase of revenue is  related to the increased commerce volume distributed to  the industry and commerce segments.
While in 2019, revenue from the transmission business  segment reached USD246 million showing a decrease  of 1% or equivalent to USD3 million compared to 2018  which was USD249 million.
This decrease of revenue  related to the decrease of volume distributed by PGN and  PT Pertamina Gas.
In terms of contribution of revenue from Affiliates namely  KJG and TGI, presentation in the consolidated financial  report is recorded as Financial Lease for KJG, while for  TGI it is recorded as portion of profit from joint venture.
In 2019, they respectively attained USD18 million and  USD157 million showing that KJG had a decrease of  52% and TGI had an increase of 2% compared to their  achievement in 2018 which was USD39 million and  USD153 million respectively.
Profitability from the distribution/transmission segment  in 2019 reached USD792 million showing a decrease of  USD47 million equivalent to minus 6% compared to 2018  which was USD839 million.
This decrease was due to  increased expenses of purchase of natural gas as a result  of a higher purchase price of natural gas from suppliers. 154 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    153 OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  BUSINESS SEGMENT The oil and gas exploration and production business  segment is the business and investment activities of PGN  in the sector of upstream oil and natural gas that covers  exploration, exploitation and business development in oil  and  natural gas.
This business segment represents PGN’s  concrete efforts to expand its portfolio in the energy  business chain through PT Saka Energi Indonesia (SEI).
In this business segment, SEI gains revenue originating  from lifting of oil.
Gas, LPG and LNG.
In terms of cost  of revenue needed for this business activity includes production and lifting costs, oil and gas depreciation  costs as well as cost allocations related to exploration and  exploitation.
In 2019, SEI managed 11 oil and natural gas block portfolio  where 6 blocks are already in production while 5 blocks  are still in the exploration phase, 10 blocs are located in  Indonesia and 1 block is located in the United States.
The  oil and natural gas portfolio in 2019 has been reduced  by two blocks if compared to 2018 due to termination of  the SEI production sharing contract for the Sanga-Sanga  block in August of 2018 and the South East Sumatera in  September 2018.

These activities have produced a number of commodities oil, gas, LPG  and LNG.
The lifting volumes of the respective products  are as follows: SEI Lifting Performance2019 2018 ∆  Amount Amount Amount % Crude Oil (in barrels per day) 4,818 7,840 -3,022 -39 Natural Gas (in bbtud) 84 117 -33 -28 LPG (in metric ton) 68 96 -28 -29 LNG (in bbtud) 48 60 -13 -21 Total Lifting (in MMBOE) 10.33 14.43 -4.11 -28LIFTING VOLUME OF UPSTREAM OIL & GAS Increasing/Decreasing Performance of Oil  and Gas Exploration and Production Business  Segment The decline in SEI’s lifting volume was primarily caused  by termination of the production sharing contract in the  Sanga-Sanga block and South East Sumatera block in the  third quarter of 2018.
Contribution from those 2 blocks in 2018 was 12% of total lifting.
In addition, there was a  cessation of production in the Muriah block in September  2019 due to an unexpected decline from their well.
The  natural gas price in the United States was quite low and  this also caused the decrease of lifting in the Fasken block.
The low price of natural gas caused the operator to delay  drilling for economic reasons.

This decline is related  to the decrease of lifting volume due to the termination of  the production sharing contract for the Sanga-Sanga and  South East Sumatera blocks in the third Quarter of 2018.
In addition there was a decrease in the oil price from  USD67/barrel in 2018 to  USD62/barrel in 2019.
Profitability of the exploration and production of oil and gas  business segment reached USD33 million or a decrease  of 77% or equivalent to USD109 million compared to  2018 which was USD142 million.
This was caused by  the decreased lifting volume due to the termination of  the production sharing contract of the Sanga-Sanga and  South East Sumatera blocks as well as the write-off of SEI’s  subsidiary investment in the Unimar joint venture at the  end of 2018 in concurrence with the termination of the  Sanga-Sanga block production sharing contract.

KJG’s main business is  transmission of natural gas.
However the impact of the  implementation of PSAK No.30 on Lease and ISAK No.8  on interpretation of transactions containing lease has  caused KJG’s transmission revenue generated in 2019  to be presented as financial lease in other businesses  segment revenues.5.
Oil Transportation and Gas Processing  Since the incorporation of PT Pertamina Gas into  PGN’s business line, there has been an addition of new  business namely oil transportation and gas processing.
In the oil transportation business PT Pertamina Gas  receives toll fees for distribution of oil through its  pipeline infrastructure.
While for gas processing,   PT Pertamina Gas produces LPG which is used to meet  LPG demand for Indonesia’s market (domestic market).
Operation/Production Related Performance of  Other Business Segments The other business segments performance also  contributes to the company’s business.
Some business  sectors experience an increase in performance namely  the telecommunication sector, oil transportation,  construction/EPC, operations and maintenance as well as  management facilities.
At the same time there has also  been a decline in performance in financial lease sector  and gas processing.
In general, other business segments  performance can be shown in the following table: Description2019 2018 Δ Amount Amount Amount % Telecommunication (MBPS) 4,524,372 3,410,276 1,114,096 33% Financial Lease – Transmission Volume (MMSCFD) 19 47 -27 -59% Gas Processing (TPD) 716 787 -71 -9% Oil Transportation (Barrel) 3,746,265 3,713,115 33,150 1% Construction/EPC & Operations and Maintenance  (Number of Projects Under Contract)859 669 190 28% Facilities Management and Asset Management Service  (Size of Area in Thousand Unit M2)305 126 179 141%OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS – OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 158 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    157 Description on Increase/Decrease of Other  Business Segments Performance  The telecommunication sector performance in 2019  experienced an increase of 33% compared to 2018.
This increase was primarily due to an increase of the  bandwidth sale capacity to external customers.
The  finance lease in this case translates to KJG transmission  volume in 2019 that shows a decline of 59% compared to  2018 due to an unexpected decline from suppliers and  the cessation of distribution in September 2019.
The gas  processing sector in 2019 also underwent a decline of 9%  compared to 2018 which was caused by an unplanned shutdown at the LPG MKS and only recommenced  operations (onstream) in the month of November 2019.
The oil transportation in 2019 increased by 1% compared  to 2018 related to the increased volume of oil transported  by PT Pertamina Gas.
The construction/EPC sector  and operation maintenance also had a performance  increase of 28% in 2019 compared to 2018, as a result of  expansion of the EPC project managed by  PGASSOL and  SENA.
While facility management service also increased  by 141% in relation with the additional areas managed by  Permata’s subsidiary.

This increase was primarily caused by  higher revenue from the Construction Sector carried  out by PGASSOL which is in line with an increase in the  number of contracted projects, and also an increase in  regasification services revenue and fiber optic leases.
While on the other hand there is a decline from the  Financial Lease segment due to a termination of natural  gas Traansportation through the Kepodang – Tambak Lorok transmission pipes in September 2019 operated  by KJG.
In addition, there was also a decline in revenue  of gas processing as a result of damage to the LPG Plant  operated by PT Pertamina Gas.
Profitability from other business segments also declined  by 185% from USD36 million in 2018 to USD-31 million in  2019.
This decline is related to the description regarding  the decline of revenue as referred to above. 158 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    157 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference DESCRIPTION  OF FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE In 2019, PGN’s business activities went well and were  relatively stable with the exception of the exploration  and production of oil and gas segment.
PGN’s financial  performance of 2019 from the distribution and  transmission segment which constitutes PGN’s core  business segment saw an increase of USD192.8 million  or 6.3% compared to 2018.
However, there were  some non-core factors that needed to be adjusted  in referrence to the applicable Financial Accountancy  Standards.
This had a significant impact on PGN’s Net  Profit of 2019 which was recorded at USD67.6 million  where it was lower to that of 2018 which was USD304.9  million showing a decline of 77.8%.
The factors impacting the Net Profit were asset value  provision compared to recovered asset values in  accordance with PSAK 48.
This was found in Pipe  Transmission asset of Kepodang – Tambak Lorok due to  cessation of use of natural gas from the Kepodang Blok  Muriah Field developed by PC Muriah Ltd (PCML) since  September 2019 causing the Company, in compliance  with the applicable accountancy standards to conduct a  provision in the Financial Report.
However, in order to obtain the rights of the Company on  its invesment, measures are currently being undertaken  using the arbitrage law by KJG to PCML to restore rights  that the KJG should receive from PCML.
At the same time, there was a tax dispute amounting to  USD127.7 million where the Supreme Court, through  Decision Number 4003/B/PK/Pjk/2019 in referrence to the  PSAK 57, ruled that the Company must make a provision  it the Financial Report.
The management is taking legal  measures regarding this tax dispute in accordance with  the prevailing laws and regulations.
The Management  remains confident that that the tax expense of USD127.7  million can be recovered in the future.
Aside from the above mentioned matters regarding the  provisions to apply the  PSAK 48 and PSAK 57, PGN’s  business activities have been running well and are  relatively stable except for the exploration and oil and gas  production business segment due to the termination of  the period of validity of the production sharing contract  for 2 (two) oil and gas blocks, namely the South East  Sumatera Block and the Sanga-Sanga bloc in the second  semester of 2018.
PGN’s financial performance in 2019  from the distribution and transmission business segment,  which constitutes PGN’s core business segment, has  increased to USD192.8 million or 6.3% compared to  2018.
In addition, its business segments outside of the  Lease Revenue also saw an increase of USD16.9 million  or 26.6% compared to the previous year, primarily from  the telecommunication sector and construction services.
INCOME STATEMENT This Net Revenues originate from three business segments of  PGN namely distribution/transmission, oil and gas exploration  and production, and other business segments which are  (1) gas processing, (2) financial lease, (3) oil transportation/ transmission, (4) fiber optic lease and (5) others namely:  construction and operations and maintenance.  160 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    159 Contribution from each business segment to Company’s Revenues in 2019 are as follows: BUSINESS SEGMENT2019 2018 ∆ Million USD % Million USD % Million USD % Gas Distribution/Commerce 2,973.94 77.3 2,790.90 72.1 183.04 6.6 Oil Transportation/Transmission 269.69 7.0 259.87 6.7 9.82 3.8 Oil and gas 374.35 9.7 585.52 15.1 (211.17) -36.1 Others Gas Processing 115.03 3.0 131.58 3.4 (16.55) -12.6 Financial Lease 18.39 0.5 38.62 1.0 (20.23) -52.4 Oil Transportation/Transmission 20.18 0.5 24.72 0.6 (4.54) -18.3 Fiber Optic Lease 18.36 0.5 13.90 0.4 4.45 32.0 Others (Construction and O&M) 58.78 1.5 25.16 0.7 33.62 133.6 Total Revenue 3,848.72 100.0 3,870.27 100.0 (21.55) -0.6 Total Cost of Revenues (2,621.35) 100.0 (2,560.77) 100.0 (60.58) 2.4 Total Gross Profit 1,227.37 1,309.50 -82.13 -6.3REVENUES CONTRIBUTION During 2019, PGN has recorded net revenues of USD3.84  billion, a decline of 0.6% compared to its revenues  in 2018, which was USD3.87 billion.
This decline in  revenues was compensated by positive contributions  from the distribution/commerce business segment that  showed an increase and from other business segments.
It is recorded that the distribution/commerce business  segment in 2019 was USD183 million showing an increase  of 6.6% compared to 2018.
Income from the distribution/ commerce business segment contributed to 77% towards  the consolidated revenues.
Increase of the distribution/commerce business  segment was due to an increased volume of natural gas  distribution to customers during the course of 2019.
Natural gas volume of 2019 was 990 BBTUD, an increase  of 3% compared to 2018 which was 960 BBTUD.
With this  increased volume of gas sale that occurred during 2019,  PGN was able to increase its overall revenue.
In terms of the transmission business segment, PGN  recorded an revenues from the natural gas transmission,  including income from regasification of USD269.7 million  during 2019, an increase of 3.8% from 2018 which was  USD259.9 million.
This increase was due to increase in  regasification revenue.
The oil and gas exploration and production business  segment in 2019 contributed a revenue of USD374.35  million or a decline of 36.1% compared to 2018 which  was USD585.52 million.
This condition was due to the  termination production sharing contract of the Sanga- Sanga Block and South East Sumatera Block in the third  semester of 2018.
In 2019, revenue from the gas processing business  segment that is part of other business segments was  USD115 million showing a decline of 12.6% compared  to 2018 which was USD131.58 million.
This condition  was primarily due to a decline in the revenue from PT  Pertamina Gas and PT Perta Arun Gas. 160 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    159 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference PGN recorded a revenue from oil transportation business  segment of USD20.2 million during 2019 which is a  decline of 18.22% compared to 2018 which was USD24.7  million.
This decline was caused by lower volume of oil  transmission of PT Pertamina Gas.
In 2019, KJG’s distribution volume saw a decline that  caused a lower revenue from financial lease which  was USD20.2 million.
This decline  was caused by the  cessation of gas transportation from the oil and gas field  of Kepodang - Muriah Block in 2019.
Due to the cessation  of gas transportation, KJG is currently undertaking an  arbitration process to obtain their rights according to the  prevailing legal provisions.
PGASOL and PERMATA contributed a revenue of USD77.14  million or an increase of 97.49% compared to 2018  which  was USD39.06 million.
This condition was due to increased  revenue from the construction of gas pipelines in PGASOL.
From the total consolidated net revenue, 38.36% was  due to a sale transaction to related entities with the  Government for the year ending on December 31st, 2019.
COST OF REVENUES PGN’s cost of revenue for 2019 comprise of purchase of  gas from suppliers, costs for production of oil and gas,  purchase of LNG and operation of FSRU, costs related  to gas processing and other revenue costs consisting of:  revenue costs for construction and management of gas  pipeline, lease of building and equipment, which in total  increased to USD2,621.4 million compared to 2018 which  was USD2,560.8 million.
The cost of revenue increased by 2.4% or equivalent  to USD60.6 from that of 2018.
The increase in the  revenue cost was primarily caused by purchase of gas  from suppliers amounting to USD152.9 million.
In 2019,  there were other revenue costs from construction and  services amounting to USD27.9 million due to asset  construction by PGASOL and other services by PERMATA  to third parties.
On the other hand, there was a decline in upstream oil  and gas operating costs amounting to USD103 million  which was primarily caused by a decline in production and  oil and gas lifting costs by SEI as well as a decline in gas  processing costs of USD15.03 million.

The increase of the cost of  purchase of gas amounting to USD152.9 million was  due to an increase in the volume of gas purchase from  suppliers which were undertaken in line with increased  volume of gas distribution to customers.
As a consequence of increased volume of gas distribution  to customers, PGN had to compensate for that increase  by purchasing gas from suppliers at higher purchase  price which ultimately increased the blended price in the  revenue cost of oil purchase.

In 2019, the cost of revenue for oil and gas was USD328.6  million which was a decline at 23.9% compared to 2018 which was USD431.68 million.
This condition was  caused bu a decline in oil and gas lifting volume, and  LPG from the oil and gas working are of SEI that was  already producing.
In addition, there was a revocation  of investment in SEI for the Unimar joint venture at the  end 2018 in line with the termination of the Sanga-Sanga  block production sharing contract.

This USD82.1 million decline was  caused by a decline in revenue from the oil and gas  exploration and production, gas processing, financial  lease and oil transportation.
DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION EXPENSES In 2019, the Distribution and Transmission Cost saw an  increase of 0.31% to become USD439.1 million compared  to 2018 which was USD437.8 million.
This USD1.3 million  increase was primarily caused by an increase in repair  and maintenance costs which was USD8.7 million,  salaries, remuneration, post service and other long terms  amounting to USD9.4 million, and general services which  was USD10.2 million.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In 2019, General and Administration Expenses saw an  increase of 7.2 % or equivalent to  USD18.1 million to  become USD269.8 million compared to 2018 which  was USD251.7 million.
In general, expense elements in  the General and Administration Expenses underwent a  decline compared to the previous year.
However, there  was a significant change in an increase to the allowance  for impairment losses for receivables and valuation of fair  value for accounts receivables in the amount of USD43  million where it was primarily caused due to provision of  impairment on lease receivables in KJG as a consequence  of the cessation of oil and gas transportation from the  Kepodang field developed by PCML to the Tambak  Lorok power plant through PT Kalimantan Jawa Gas (KJG) transmission pipes.
Regarding the cessation of  transportation of natural gas KJG is currently undertaking  an arbitrage process to gain their rights in accordance  with the provisions of the prevailing laws.
OTHER INCOME In 2019, other revenues saw a decline of 29.58% of  USD62.1 million compared to 2018 which was USD88.2  million.
The USD26.1 million decline was primarily caused  to the fact that there were no other revenues in 2019  received by PGN as was the case in 2018 that included  revenues such as tax refund from the Pangkah block  which was received in 2018 in the sum of USD37.6 million,  accrued refund in 2017 that was recorded in 2018, and  receipt of tax paid of the PLI Subsidiary Entity for tax  audits in 2015 which was received in 2018.
Those other  revenues in 2018 were not part of routine revenues thus  those other revenues were not recorded in 2019.
This  caused PGN’s other revenues in 2019 to show a decline.
OTHER EXPENSES In 2019, other revenues saw a decline of 6.8% of USD34.2  million compared to 2018 which was USD36.7 million.
OPERATING PROFIT In 2019, PGN suffered a decline in operational profit  amounting to 18.64%  to become USD546.3 million  compared to that of 2018 which was USD671.5 million.
This USD125.2 million decline was primarily caused by a  decline in gross profits, an increase in the Distribution/ Transmission business segment expenses, increase in  Administration and General expenses, and a decline in  Other Revenues. 164 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    163 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference FINANCE INCOME In 2019, the financial revenue saw a decline of 13.0% to  become USD30.1 million compared to 2018 which was  USD34.6 million.
The USD4.5 million decline was primarily  caused by a lower interest rate of the time deposit in 2019.
FINANCE COST The Financial Expenses of 2019 saw an increase of  12.46% to become USD172.5 million compared to 2018  which was USD153.4 million.
The increase of the Financial  Expenses in the sum of USD19.1 million was primarily  caused due to interest expenses on promissory notes of  USD11.1 million, and an increase in the interest increase  expenses on loans to banks amounting to USD6.9 million.
LOSS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE-NET In 2019, there was a loss of foreign exchange amounting  to USD28.0 million, an increase of 48.7% when compared  to the loss of foreign ex chance of 2018 that amounted to  USD18.8 million.
The increase was primarily caused by a  strengthening of JPY exchange rate to the USD aside from  a strengthening of the IDR to the USD thus causing a loss  of foreign exchange due to translation of liability of the JPY  as well as the IDR into USD.
The position of the USD to the  Japanese Yen on December 31st, 2018 was JPY 110.4/USD  strengthening to JPY 108.6/USD on December 31st, 2019.
The position of the USD to the Rupiah on December 31st,  2018 was Rp14,481/USD strengthening to Rp13,901/USD  on December 31st, 2019.
GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF  DERIVATIVES In 2019, there was a profit on change in fair value of  derivatives amounting to USD45 thousand while in 2018,  a profit on change in fair value of derivatives amounting  to USD4.6 million.

In the event of such an indication during  the impairment testing, the Company makes a formal  estimation on the amount of assets recovered.
The  recovered amount determined for individual assets is  the higher total between the asset fair value or the Cash  Generating Unit (CGU)  minus the sale expenses for sale  with its value in use, unless those assets do not generate  cash inflows which are mostly independent of assets or  groups of assets.
If the  Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is  higher than the amount of the recovered asset, then  the asset is deemed as having been impaired and the  carrying value of the asset is lowered to be equal to the  recovered amount.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated net future cash  flow is discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflect current market assessments of  the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
In  determining fair value less costs to sell, the recent market  transactions are taken into account, when available.
If no such transaction can be identified, the Company  uses an appropriate valuation model to determine the  asset’s fair value.
These calculations are corroborated by  valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.
This assessment is made at the end of reporting date  to determine as to whether there is any indication that  previously recognized impairment losses may no longer  exist or may have decreased.
If such indications as mentioned above are identified, the  entity estimates the amount recovered of assets or the  CGU.
Recognized impaired losses during the previous  period/year for non-goodwill assets are reversed only if  there are changes to the assumptions used to determine  the recovered amount of assets since the last recognized  impaired losses.
In this case, the carrying amount is increased in terms of the recovered amount.
The reversal  is limited so that the asset carrying amount does not  exceed the recovered amount or the carrying amount, net  after depreciation, whtere there is no impairment losses  are recognized for those assets in the previous period/ year.
Reversal of impairment losses is recognized as profit  or loss.
Following the reversal, the asset depreciation  is adjusted to the coming period on a systematic basis  during the useful life of the asset.
In 2018, PGN recorded impairment losses for the oil and  gas property in the Pangkah working area of USD26.22  million that was caused by a decline in oil price at the  end of 2018.

There  were circumstances that stymied the achievement of the  target set in the year earlier.
The following is summary of  PGN’s performance target in 2019.   180 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    179 REVENUE COGS GROSS PROFIT OPERATING COST  OPERATING  PROFITNET INCOME 4,086.29 2,808.47 1,277.81 674.57 618.17 310.01 3,848.72 2,621.35 1,227.37 708.93 546.33 67.584.000 3.000 5002.0003.500 1.0002.500 -1.500TARGET ACHIEVEMENT 2019 (IN MILLION USD) RKAP 2019 REALIZATION 2019 ANALYSIS OF THE OPERATION/PRODUCTION  AND MARKETING REALIZATION The realization of gas management in 2019 includes  distribution/commerce with 990 BBTUD or 99% of the  Budget and Work Plan (RKAP) in 2019 and transmission  with 1,369.85 MMSCFD or 94.3% of the RKAP 2019.
The mistargeted operational performance was due to  external factors.
The decrease in gas distribution was  caused by the cutback in processed gas volume as a result of the lowering performance of LPG dehydrator  belonging to PT Media Karya Sentosa (MKS).
The  dwindling gas transmission volume was mainly due the  volume decrease in some transmission segments run by  PT Pertamina Gas such as inactivity in ammonia plant  run by Pupuk Iskandar Muda, slashed gas absorption in  Pupuk Kujang due to shut down in plant 1A, and dropped  rate of gas use in Pupuk Sriwidjaja as only three out of  four plants were in operation. 180 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    179 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference Target Comparison & Realization of OperationsTarget  2019Realization 2019∆ Amount Amount Amount % Distribution Volume (BBTUD) 998 990 8 -1 Transmission Volume (MMSCFD) 1,456 1,369 87 -6 Oil & Gas Lifting (MMBOE) 10.8 10.3 1 -7 Gas Processing (TPD) 753 716 37 -5 Oil Transportation (MMBOE) 4.36 3.74 1 -14 Regasification (BBTUD) 130 120 10 -8   ANALYSIS OF THE REVENUE REALIZATION Net income in 2019 amounted to USD3,848.7 million or  94.2% of the RKAP 2019 which was mainly determined  by the decrease in the company’s operating volume and  delay in gas price increase according to Minister of Energy  and Mineral Resources Letter No.482/12/MEM.
M/2019  on the Postponement of Gas Price Readjustment of   PT PGN for Commerce and Industrial Customers which  was initially scheduled to take place on July 2019.
The  contracting net revenue affected operating profit which  reached USD546.33 million or 92.5% of the RKAP 2019.
ANALYSIS OF THE PROFIT REALIZATION Profit of the Current Period in 2019 reached USD67.6  million or 21.8% of the RKAP 2019 which was mainly shaped  by the non-cash items like provision for SEI tax dispute  and impairment of assets on transmission pipelines as  well as provision for KJG leasing receivables in keeping  with the cessation of gas distribution from Kepodang- Muriah Block field; loss on foreign exchange translation  due to appreciation of JPY against USD in account payable  balance in JPY; Rupiah foreign exchange difference over  the acquisition transaction of PT Pertamina Gas; and  delayed increase of gas price.
ANALYSIS OF THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN  RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT In order to accomplish the vision and mission and support  PGN’s role as Gas Subholding, the Company keeps on  setting up comprehensive capacity building programs  for the employees which consistently parallel to either  in-house and public training, certification, knowledge  sharing, and courses.
The programs are systematically  designed to adapt to the company’s growth in that PGN  employees could make the grade and work professionally.
PGN is committed to build the capacity of its employees  so as to fill the capability gap among employees.
PGN is  prepared with programs to develop technical proficiency  and managerial skill through in-house and public training  as well as certification.
In 2019, PGN set 80 programs  of in-house technical proficiency of which realization is  83 programs.
PGN also set the implementation target  of in-house managerial skill at 20 programs of which  realization was 26 programs.
The participation rate in the  development program stood at 87% of the targeted 80%. 182 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    181 LEARNING  DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM in 2019TARGET REALIZATION 1In-house training  program of technical  proficiency75 programs 83 programs 2Workers’ Participation  Rate 80% 87% 3In-house Training  Program of  managerial skill20 programs 26 programs TARGET FOR INCOMING YEAR Macro Assumption Global growth was projected to rise from an estimated  3.0% in 2019 to 3.4% in 2020 as predicted in the World  Economic Outlook (WEO) of October 2019.
The projection  reflects the economic activities in a few emerging markets,  notably India, which is forecasted to reach 7.0% from 6.1%  in 2019, and ASEAN countries which are estimated to  increase from 4.8% in 2019 to 4.9% in 2019.
Meanwhile,  advanced economies like China and the U.
were seen  as gradually slowing.
The U.
S is predicted to slow by 2.1%  in 2020 from 2.4% in 2019, while China decelerated from  5.8% in 2020 from 6.1% in 2019.
GDP in Indonesia is estimated by LPEM FEB of Universitas  Indonesia to rise between 5.0% and 5.2%, slower than  that in 2019.
Several external blows including geopolitical  turmoil and plunge in commodity prices, made worse  by weak domestic economy, making an early sign that  further decline will occur in 2020.
In the said year, export  performance is deemed sluggish due to disproportionate  dependence on raw commodities especially palm oil and coal, not to mention the weak manufacture that is  still highly reliant on imported raw material and capital  goods all of which is expected to prolong Indonesia’s  trade deficit.
Based on the 2020 State Budget Book, the Indonesia  crude price (ICP) is likely set at US$63 per barrel, which  remains leveled with the 2019 outlook.
However, the  fluctuating demand of world crude oil may shake global  oil prices in 2020.
In addition to ICP, regulations will be the  main focus as regards natural gas business sustainability.
Supported by acceptable policy and passion to channel  good energy, PGN is consistently committed to support  the government programs through infrastructure  development and gas distribution to various places in  Indonesia for better wellbeing of the Indonesian people.
Marketing and Operational Targets The national economic growth in 2020 which is projected  to reach between 5.0% and 5.2% will certainly affect the  Company’s performance in 2020.
However, the company  is hopeful that its performance will improve through  increase in volume: Description Real  2019Target  2020 Distribution Volume (BBTUD)*949 982 Transmission Volume (MMSCFD)**1,369 1.377 Oil & Gas Lifting (MMBOE) 10.3 11 Gas Processing (TPD)*** 64 66.4 Oil Transportation (MMBOE) 3.74 3.65 Regasification (BBTUD) 120 126 *       Exclude Processed Gas **    Exclude TGI & KJG *** Exclude Perta Samtan 182 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    181 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference Revenue and Profit Targets Income and Profit Target in 2020 is expected to  complement the increase in operational volume as  mentioned above.
PGN focuses on its core business while reinforcing  the diversification of non-gas businesses to shore  its performance.
PGN expands to construction and  engineering, telecommunication, electricity, and property  through subsidiaries and affiliations aiming at achieving  the projected income and profit.
The Company sets Strategic Imperatives to achieve the  above performance target that will serve as a model for  the internal stakeholders in PGN Group to keep being  integrated and directed in achieving the Company’s  targets:  1.
Upstream  The company will keep optimizing the assets portfolio  of the existing upstream natural gas to pump up  added-valued to the Company as well as streamlining  the unit cost of production. 2.

BUSINESS PROSPECT In 2019, the government issued Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation Number 14/2019 which  specifies the Amendment of Minister of Energy and  Mineral Resources Number 58/2017 concerning Selling  Price of Natural Gas through Pipelines.
In downstream  oil and gas businesses, the management cost for natural  gas infrastructure is set at 11% (eleven percent) at best  in US Dollar.
In terms of infrastructure development by Oil and  Natural Gas Business Licensee Enterprise in areas where  pioneering natural gas market and its infrastructure is,  the Oil and Natural Gas Business Licensee Enterprise  may propose the highest IRR at 12% (twelve percent) in  US dollar.
Under certain condition, the IRR is subject to  evaluation and revision by the Minister.
The natural gas volume referred in the early economic  calculation equals the allocated natural gas owned  or 60% (sixty percent) of the capacity of the designed  pipelines.
The economic span of the project is measured,  at the slightest, 30 years since the first selling price of  downstream natural gas is set.
Through Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources  Regulation Number 04/2018, an enterprise is granted  exclusive Limited Trading Area until a guarantee of  investment return is locked at a certain extent of time.
The aforementioned regulation also particularly specifies  the appointment of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN)  in constructing and operating Transmission Pipelines  and/or Distribution Network Area so as to accelerate  infrastructure development.
Challenges that PGN will be  dealing with going forward include massive development of  gas infrastructure in 2020, household gas pipeline network  development originating from the State Budget of 266,070,  and improvement in PGN capacity as a global player taking  into account its status as the national subholding company  of midstream and downstream natural gas.

Myanmar is  targeted in the LNG trading with projected demand of 0.5  metric ton per year (mtpa) or equals 9 cargoes per year.
The next target in 2023 is the Philippines.
Based on the external and internal conditions, as well  as concerning the direction of the government policy on  domestic gas utilization, PGN sees sound outlook on its  international business in the years ahead.
BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT The Company has prepared various business plans to  expand its business in all chains of natural gas sector  in Indonesia.
As a gas subholding, the Management  clearly steers direction of its business to stronger natural  gas management going forward.
Initiatives have been  formulated to dominate the natural gas market share not  only domestically but also globally.

The domestic gas business is highly dependent on the  realized gas demand for industry, electricity (PLN), and  oil refinery in that other business portfolios overseas are  required to support business growth.
LNG Business Unit mainly accounts for initiating the  business development of LNG infrastructure in 62omesti  of Southeast Asia and America, LNG supply for PGN  Group, LNG Trading, business development related to  the LNG infrastructure in 62omestic, and aligning LNG  business in PGN subsidiaries/affiliations.
As for LNG Technical Support, it has contributed  to technical support and project management for  operational & maintenance as well as developing  infrastructure and businesses of LNG Pertamina Group,  PGN Group and its subsidiaries.
ACQUISITION OF GAS BASED POWER PLANT In order to step up the natural gas business portfolio,  especially downstream, the Company focuses on electric  power industry particularly gas-based power plant.
For  the time being, the Company has affiliated to an entity  on electricity named Widar.
The Company chose Widar to  supply electricity and other supporting services so as to  maintain and create gas market and boost the Company’s  overall income.
In line with the Company’s articles of  association, Widar’s business includes electricity supply  and supporting electricity services.
However, the current electricity portfolio proves  inadequate to lead the market and improve the Company’s  core business in natural gas.
The Company’s strategy to  penetrate the business aims at both organic and inorganic  188 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    187 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference business developments.
Pursuant to the plan, a number of  business opportunities have been secured and followed  up.
The Company’s participation in gas-based power plant  is scheduled to be executed by 2020.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Based on the long-term business plan of State Gas  Company (PGN) 2019 – 2024, the Company sets Corporate  Target in 2024 as follows: distribution volume of 2,400  BBTUD, USD8 billion of income, and USD1 billion of net  profit.
PGN has designed the business development  plan for its core and derivative businesses.
The target  nonetheless will not be achieved if the only focus for  growth is domestic market.
Therefore, PGN intends to  penetrate to the international market to compensate for  the gap in the target.
To carry through with the business development  overseas, PGN has classified countries that are  potential for partnership.
Turkey as one of the targeted  countries is selected because of its quite high— and increasing—demand of natural gas, adequate  gas infrastructure, and opportunity for investors or  external parties to develop business in the country  thanks to local regulations and policies.
WASTE TO ENERGY Waste has been a growing concern especially in cities  where population growth concurs with urbanization  and changes in consumption patterns from natural  ingredients to man-made.
Reckless handling of waste  may lead to poor environment (land, air, and water  pollution) and public health.
Waste that does not easily  decompose will pollute the soil, while open burning of waste will result in the release of toxic pollutants into  the air.
In addition, water from decomposed waste will  contaminate ground water.
Some government policies that support the Waste  to Energy program open the way for the Company to  get to the field.
All these years, the paradigm in waste  management in Indonesia has been limited to collect- transport-dump principle which only adds pressure  to landfill.
On the other hand, cities often deal with  limited land.
For this reason, a breakthrough in the  development of waste management technology and  business, such as the implementation of Waste to  Energy program, is required.
PREMIUM CITY GAS The government, through Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources has authorized PGN to operate the gas  distribution network for households as the Company  is deemed competent for such task.
The green light for  PGN involves work that is concerned with running and  maintaining the gas network for households as well as  supplying and distributing gas to households.
Nonetheless, a number of issues concerning the feasibility  of the distribution network especially household users still  impede the business development.
Such issues include  high investment, low volume of household gas use, and  high operation and maintenance costs.
Consequently,  PGN is preparing Premium Gas Network, a business  model that may solve the said problem.
It is expected  that the scheme will avoid Household Gas Network from  burdening the Company, but contributing more to its  income growth.  190 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    189 ISOTANK MANUFACTURED Industrial gas is resulted from a separation process and  production process.
The separation process produces  Oxygen (O2), Nitrogen (N2), Argon (Ar), and Helium (He).
Acetylene (C2H2) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) occur in a  chemical reaction whose process requires Calcium  carbide (for Acetylene) and Ammonium Nitrate (for Nitrous  Oxide).
As for Hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2),  the chemical reaction and separation need Hydrocarbon.
Industrial gas serves consumers from industries as  diverse as food and beverage, chemical, cosmetic,  hospital, steel, automotive, to name but a few.
Normally,  the product takes the form of gas,  but it is distributed in  gas or liquid depending on the volume of gas utilization  and distance between consumers and the producer.
For consumers with relatively high gas consumption, the  industrial gas producer may distribute the product in  liquid gas through transportation line.
As for those with  low industrial gas consumption, the product is distributed  through gas cylinder (ISO tanks).
Air Separation Plant  (ASP) which produces Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Argon are  the largest market for industrial gas.
The market shares at  least 45% of the total industrial gas market in Indonesia.
Asetilen, Carbon dioxide, Hydrogen, and Nitrous oxide are  products having fairly high demand.
ISO Tank is a possible choice for distributing liquid gas,  and it is built with the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO) standard.
ISO tank is made of stainless  steel and carbon steel covered by various protective layers.
Isolations may differ depending on the content.
ISO tank  has cylinder-like shape with varied dimensions.
Average life  of each tank is around 8-16 years.
Today, four companies  supply industrial gas: Liquide Indonesia, PT United Air Products, PT Linde Indonesia, and PT Aneka Gas Industri  with 73% of market share.
Such a sizeable share is potential  for development by the Company.
MARKETING ASPECTS MARKET SHARE During 2019, natural gas production in Indonesia for  domestic consumption reached ±6,100 MMScfd and  ±2,670 MMScfd for export consumption.
In terms of  natural gas utilization, the manufacturing industry sector  contributes 26% in the utilization of national natural  gas.
In terms of utilization of natural gas for domestic  consumption, around 4,000 MMScfd is managed by the  upstream sector to be channeled directly to end users  and around 1,040 MMScfd is managed by a natural gas  natural gas business facility.
In terms of utilization of PGN  as one of the facilitated commercial gas business entities,  it controls around 92% of the commercial gas market  share through distribution pipes in Indonesia.
The market  share in 2019 increased compared with the year earlier  which stood at 89%.

The government has issued several regulations  concerning the arrangement of natural gas commerce in  Indonesia, among others:  • Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation  Number 6/2016 on Provisions and Guidelines of  Natural Gas Allocation and Pricing.
• Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation  Number 58/2017 on Selling Price of Natural Gas  through Pipelines in Downstream Oil and Gas  Business as amended by Minister of Energy and  Mineral Resources Regulation Number 14/2019  on Amendment of Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources Regulation Number 58/2017 on Selling  Price of Natural Gas through Pipelines in Downstream  Oil and Gas Business.
• Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation  Number 4/2018 on Natural Gas Exploitation in  Downstream Oil and Gas Business.
The aforementioned Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources Regulation will regulate selling prices of natural  gas in natural gas commerce.
The regulation will be  implemented not later than June 2019.
PGN has proposed natural gas selling price to  Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources to  implement the regulation on gas selling prices  through pipelines for a stipulation via letter   Number 029502.
S/PP.01.01/PDO/2019 dated 18 July  2019 on Proposed Gas Selling Price through Pipelines  in Downstream Natural Gas Business based on  Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation  Number  58/2017.
In response to the selling price readjustment, PGN has also  delivered report via letter Number 042100.
S/PP.01/PDO/2019  dated October 23rd, 2019 on Planned Readjustment of  Downstream Natural Gas Price.
Up until December 31st,  2019, the plan to readjust PGN downstream selling price of  gas had yet to be set out taking into consideration letter of  Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources to Minister of State- owned Enterprises Number 482/12/MEM.

PGN also provides one-way door facility  to tackle customer complaints through round-the-clock  Contact Center 1500645, Rely On PGN subscription  monitoring system, SMS Broadcast, and social media  channels of PGN and PGN Mobile.
In responding to customers’ needs, PGN in 2019  presented alternative solutions including repositioning  of product in which monthly flexibility program for  several customers segments is.
PGN also released Gas  Deposit—customers already pay, but not yet utilized— and Spot Gas which involves bookable gas that may be  utilized in current month.
In 2019, PGN launched Bailout Fund program in that PGN,  customers, and banks work hand in hand in cashflow  management by applying gas utilization billing scheme.
PGN also responded to demand from group  customer—type of customers who are under a  management or whose shares are owned by the same  entity—to be able to make benefit of gas by optimizing  gas use arrangement in every location where group  customers are through Multidestination scheme.
PGN Mobile Enhancement  PGN Mobile is the official application of the Company  available in Apple Store and Play Store.
The app  offers information on gas usage and billing, PGN  gas infrastructure, gas refuelling station, and other  features.
The implementation of Bank Indonesia  Regulation on the mandatory use of Rupiah in all  transactions within the territory of the Republic of  Indonesia prompted PGN to upgrade PGN Mobile  features.
Through Payment Plan feature, customers  may send information of scheduled day for paying the  bill as well as converting value of the billing to Rupiah.
Therefore, customers will be eased in paying with the  fair value.
PGN Partner Enhancement  More than 6,000 requests on technical services were  filed through PGN Contact Center 1500645 in 2019.
Most requests dealt with repair of gas equipments,  repair of gas pipe installation in homes, and technical  issue in gas distribution.

REGULATORY CHANGES In 2019, there were regulatory changes that directly and  significantly affected PGN’s business operations.
As a  state-owned oil and gas sub-holding company engaged  in natural gas transmission and distribution, PGN is  compliant with the new regulations.
A summary of the  new/updated regulations are as follows:1.
Government Regulation No. 48 Year 2019 on  Amounts and Uses of Fees Levied on Business  Entities Engaged in the Supply and Distribution  of Fuels and Transportation of Natural Gas by  Pipelines, issued on July 3rd, 2019 and came into  effect on September 6, 2019  The Government has issued the Government Regulation  No. 48 Year 2019 on Amounts and Uses of Fees  Levied on Business Entities Engaged in the Supply and  Distribution of Fuels and Transportation of Natural Gas  by Pipelines to revoke the Government Regulation No.  1 Year 2006 that governed the same matter.
The new  regulation effected changes in the following provisions: a)There is a decrease in the amount of the levy of transpo rting natural gas through pipelines as follows:: Natural gas volume transported by  pipelinesPercentage of Natural Gas Transportation Fees per MSCF PP 1/2006 PP 48/2019 Up to 100,000,000 (one hundred million)  MSCF per year3% (three percent) 2.50% (two-point five percent) More than 100,000,000 (one hundred  million) MSCF per year2% (two percent) 1.50% (one-point five percent) 206 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    205 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference 2.
Regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources No. 14 Year 2019 on Amendment to  the Regulation of the Minister of Energy and  Mineral Resources No. 58 Year 2017 on Pricing of  Natural Gas by Pipelines in Downstream Oil and  Gas Business Activities, issued on September 16th,  2019 and came into effect on January 1st, 2020  The Regulation Number 14 Year 2019 was issued  to establish calculation methods so that natural gas  remains affordable, and accounts for fair economic  value in fees associated with transporting natural gas  using pipelines for distribution (dedicated downstream).
The main change introduced by the regulation is in a  project’s economic useful life, calculated as part of the  management costs of natural gas infrastructure.
Under  the new rule, a project’s economic useful life must be at  least 30 (thirty) years since the downstream natural gas  price is first set.
The regulation requires assets in a natural gas  distribution network to be depreciated according to  the Government’s mandated economic useful life.
Consequently, a business entity in natural gas trading  has to account for depreciation, in turn affecting  natural gas pricing.
As for pricing, the Company has proposed its selling  price to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources  in accordance with prevailing regulations.
As at the  end of 2019, the Company is still coordinating with  the Ministry on implementation of the regulation.

CHANGES IN  ACCOUNTING POLICIES CHANGES IN SFAS AND IFAS  New standards, amendments and interpretations  issued and effective for the financial year beginning   January 1st, 2019,  hich do not have a material impact on  the consolidated financial statements of the Group are  as follows: • SFAS No. 22: Business Combination  The amendment clarifies that obtaining control of  a business that is a joint operation, is a business  combination achieved in stages.
The acquirer should  re-measure its previously held interest in the joint  operation at fair value at the acquisition date.
• SFAS No. 24: Employee Benefits regarding Plan  Amendment, Curtailment, or Settlement  Amendments to this SFAS require an entity to use  updated assumptions to determine current service  cost and net interest for the remainder of the period  after a plan amendment, curtailment, or settlement.
It  also requires an entity to recognise in profit or loss as  part of past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, any reduction in a surplus, even if that surplus was not  previously recognised because of the impact of the  asset ceiling.
• SFAS No. 26: Borrowing Costs  The amendment clarifies that if a specific borrowing  remains outstanding after the related qualifying asset  is ready for its intended use or sale, it becomes part  of general borrowings.
This amendment is applied  prospectively for borrowing costs incurred on or after  the effective date.
• SFAS No. 46: Income Taxes  The amendment clarifies that the income tax  consequences of dividends on financial instruments  classified as equity should be recognised according  to where the past transactions or events that  generated distributable profits were recognised.
These  requirements apply to all income tax consequences of  dividends.
• SFAS No. 66: Joint Arrangements  The amendment clarifies that the party obtaining joint  control of a business that is a joint operation should  not re-measure its previously held interest in the joint  operation.
• IFAS No. 33: Foreign Currency Transactions and  Advance Consideration  This interpretation clarifies the use of transaction  date in determining the exchange rate to be used for  initial recognition of asset, expense or income when  the entity receives or pays advance consideration in  foreign currency. 214 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    213 • IFAS No. 34: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments  IFAS No. 34 is an interpretation of SFAS No. 46: Income  Tax which clarifies and provides guidance in reflecting  the uncertainties of income tax treatment in the  financial statements.
New standards, amendments and interpretations  issued but not yet effective for the financial year  beginning January 1, 2019, are as follows: • SFAS No. 15: Investment in Associates and Joint  Ventures, Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint  Ventures  The amendment of this SFAS clarifies that companies  account for long-term interests in an associate or joint  venture to which the equity method is not applied,  using SFAS No. 71.
• Amendment SFAS No. 62: Insurance Contracts -  Applying SFAS No. 71: Financial Instruments with SFAS  No. 62: Insurance Contracts   This amendment is a consequential revision due to  the issuance of SFAS No. 71.
The amended standard  provides guidance for issuance of insurance contracts  (especially by insurance companies) to implement  SFAS No. 71.
There will be two approaches that can  be chosen by a reporting entity which are deferral and  overlay approach.
• SFAS No. 71: Financial Instruments  This new standard provides new requirements on the  classification and measurement of financial assets and  liabilities.
It also includes an expected credit losses  model that replaces the incurred loss impairment  model used currently and also new requirements  for hedge accounting.
Consequential amendments  to other standards, including SFAS No. 55: Financial  Instruments are made.
While the Group has not finalised its detailed  assessment of the classification and measurement of  financial assets, equity instruments currently classified  as available-for-sale financial assets would appear to  satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value  through other comprehensive income and hence  there will be no change to the accounting treatment  for these assets.
There will be no material impact on Group’s the  accounting for financial liabilities as the Group only has  one financial liabilities classification, that is financial  liabilities at amortised cost.
The derecognition rules  have been transferred from SFAS No. 55: Financial  Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have  not been changed.
The new hedge accounting rules will align the  accounting for hedging instruments more closely with  the Group’s risk management practices.
As a general  rule, more hedge relationships might be eligible for  hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a more  principles-based approach.
The Group does not have  214 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    213 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference hedging instruments, hence the Group does not  expect a significant impact on the accounting for its  hedging relationships.
The new impairment model requires the recognition  of impairment provisions based on expected credit  losses rather than only incurred credit losses as is  the case under SFAS No. 55.
It applies to financial  assets classified at amortised cost, debt instruments  measured at fair value through other comprehensive  income, contract assets under SFAS No. 72: Revenue  from Contracts with Customers, lease receivables,  loan commitments and certain financial guarantee  contracts.
While the Group has not finalised  its detailed assessment of how its impairment  provisions would be affected by the new model, it  may result in an earlier recognition of credit losses.
The new standard also introduces expanded  disclosure requirements and changes in  presentation.
These are expected to change the  nature and extent of the Group’s disclosures about  its financial instruments, particularly in the year of  adoption of the new standard.
• Amendment to SFAS No. 71: Financial Instruments -  Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation  This amendment deals with prepayment features  with negative compensation and allows entities to  measure particular financial assets which are called  negative compensation payments at amortised cost  or at fair value through other comprehensive income  if specific conditions are met instead of at fair value  through profit or loss.
• SFAS No. 72: Revenue from Contracts with Customers  This SFAS will replace the following standards: • SFAS No. 23: Revenue; • SFAS No. 34: Construction Contracts; • IFAS No. 10: Customer Loyalty Programmes; • SFAS No. 44: Accounting for Real Estate Development.
As a result, this SFAS will become the single standard  for revenue recognition.
The new standard is based on  the principle that revenue is recognised when control  of a good or service transfers to a customer.
The  standard may result in changes to the Group’s revenue  recognition policies.
At this stage, the Group is not able to estimate the  impact of the new standards on the Group’s Financial  Statements.
The Group is currently performing more  detailed assessments.
• SFAS No. 73: Leases  SFAS No. 73 was issued in September 2017.
It will  result in almost all leases being recognised on the  statement of financial position, as the distinction  between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the  leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are  recognised.
The only exceptions are shortterm leases  and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not change significantly.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for  the Group’s operating leases.
As at the reporting  date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease  216 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    215 commitments (see Note 39b).
The Group has not yet  determined to what extent these commitments within  the Group will result in the recognition of an asset and  a liability for future payments and how this will affect  the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows.
Some of the commitments may be covered by the  exception for short-term and low-value leases and  some commitments may relate to arrangements that  will not qualify as leases under SFAS 73.
• SFAS No. 112: Accounting for Endowments  This SFAS regulates the accounting treatment for  endowments from a corporate donor to individual and  corporate recipients.
• IFAS No. 35: Presentation of Financial Statements of  Non-profit Oriented Entities  This interpretation provides an illustrative example of  financial reporting by a nonprofit oriented entity.
• Annual Improvements 2019 SFAS No. 1: Presentation  of Financial Statements This clarifies some wording in the standard to align  with the intention in SFAS No. 1.
• Amendment to SFAS No. 1: Presentation of Financial  Statements and SFAS No. 25: Accounting Policies,  Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors  The amendment clarifies several wording and material  definitions in order to align with the definitions used in  the conceptual framework and some relevant SFAS.
The above new standards, amendments, annual  improvements and interpretations are effective  beginning January 1st, 2020, except for SFAS No. 112  which is effective from January 1st, 2021.
Early adoption  of the above standards is permitted except for IFAS No.  35, Amendment to SFAS No. 1 and SFAS No. 1, while  early adoption of SFAS No. 73 is permitted only upon  the early adoption of SFAS No. 72.
As at the authorisation date of these consolidated  financial statements, management is still evaluating the  potential impact of these new and revised standards to  the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 216 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    215 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference BUSINESS CONTINUITY Information on PGN’s business continuity in 2019 is as  follows: 1.
Description and Effects of Important Matters  in 2019 that Significantly Affect the Company’s  Business Continuity: a.
In 2019, the electric power industry remains the  largest consumer of natural gas supplied by PGN.
According to the Electricity Supply Business Plan  2019-2028 prepared by the PT PLN (Persero) and  approved by the Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources by virtue of its Decision No. 39.
K/20/ MEM/2019, electric generation is projected to grow  by 6.42% with a planned capacity of 56,395 MW.
In  the projection, 22% of electricity will be generated  using natural gas.
This provides a long-term volume  growth for PGN.
In the downstream sector, sales in the gas distribution  segment increased significantly due to higher gas  demand for electricity generation and increased  industrial consumption as a result of Indonesia’s  economic growth in 2019.
In the gas transmission  segment, there was an increase in transmitted  volume under the Gas Transportation Agreement,  particularly to supply PLN’s operations in North  Sumatra.
A similar increase was also seen under the Terminal Usage Agreement for PLN’s operations in  Jawa Barat served by the FSRU Lampung.
Following its acquisition of Pertagas in 2018, PGN  expanded its business portfolio by engaging in  oil transportation, natural gas processing, LNG  regasification, and gas compression.
• Pertagas operated the Tempino-Plaju oil pipeline  to carry out its oil transportation business.
Currently, Pertagas has renewed its pipelines  to replace its existing system that have been  in operation for more than 70 years.
The new  pipeline will supply oil to the Refinery Unit III Plaju  operated by PT Pertamina (Persero).
• Pertagas operates the refineries to process gas  into Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG).
• PT Perta Arun Gas, a Pertagas subsidiary, carries  out LNG regasification at its Offloading and LNG  Regasification Plant in Arun, Lhokseumawe, Aceh.
• PT Perta Daya Gas, a Pertagas subsidiary, has  carried out natural gas compression since 2015.
Throughout 2019, global oil prices were fluctuating.
Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) showed a steady  increase in the first quarter and second half of 2019  despite   a brief decline in the second quarter of  2019.
The fluctuation significantly affected PGN’s  upstream subsidiary, Saka Energi Indonesia, and in  turn affected the Group’s financial performance on  a consolidated basis.   218 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    217 90 70 2050 080 3060 1040INDONESIAN CRUDE PRICE (ICP) 2018 - 2019 1/1/2018 1/1/20197/1/2018 7/1/20193/1/2018 3/1/20199/1/2018 9/1/20195/1/2018 5/1/201911/1/2018 11/1/20192/1/2018 2/1/20198/1/2018 8/1/20194/1/2018 4/1/201910/1/2018 10/1/20196/1/2018 6/1/201912/1/2018 12/1/2019  Source: Bloomberg Terminal e.
The Government issued the Presidential Regulation  No. 6 Year 2019 on Supply and Distribution of Natural  Gas through Gas Transmission and/or Distribution  Networks for Households and Small Industries (Jargas).
To complement the regulation, the Government also  issued the Decision of the Minister of Energy and  Mineral Resources No. 268 K/10/MEM/2018 dated  January 25th, 2018 on Appointment of PT Perusahaan  Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk.
to Supply and Distribute  Natural Gas through Gas Transmission and/or  Distribution Networks for Households for Budget Year  2018.
The latter regulation, in particular, showed that  PGN is the Government’s strategic partner to ensure  national energy resilience and energy diversification by  fast-tracking fuel oils to gas in the household sector.
According to the Decision of the Minister, PGN is  responsible to: • Develop natural gas distribution networks for  households and small industries, along with its  supporting infrastructure in Kota Medan, Kabupaten Deli Serdang, Kabupaten Serang, Kota Pasuruan,  and Kabupaten Probolinggo.
The appointment was  financed using the State Budget for the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources for Budget Year 2018.
• Develop natural gas distribution networks for  households and small industries, along with its  supporting infrastructure in Kabupaten Bogor, Kota  Cirebon, and Kota Tarakan.
The appointment was  financed using the State Budget for the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources for Budget Year 2018.
The  appointment is financed using PGN’s internal  sources.
The appointment strengthened PGN’s  commitment to expand natural gas usage and  services across Indonesia. 218 PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    Annual Report 2019 Annual Report 2019      PT Perusahaan Gas Negara Tbk    217 Report  to The ShareholdersCompany ProfileManagement Discussion and AnalysisCorporate Social and Environmental ResponsibilityConsolidated Financial  StatementsGood Corporate GovernancePerformance OverviewRegulatory Cross Reference 2.
Adjustments Made by the Company  In 2019, the total household connections increased to  393,453 or 98.99% of PGN’s total customers.
PGN is  restructuring its organization.
As of 2019, it has formed  three units to manage its operations and achieve its  operating goals, i.
Infrastructure Business Unit (BUI)  to manage infrastructure; Gas Product Business unit to  manage natural gas commodity and customer service;  and Jargas Service Unit.
The Jargas Service Unit was to  manage operations of the Natural Gas for Households  and Small Industries, such that the Company can  achieve its operating targets more effectively and  efficiently.
The Jargas Service unit provides human  resources assistance to the Government, in this case  the Directorate General of Oil and Gas, to supervise  development of natural gas distribution networks. 3.
Management’s Assumptions During Assessments a.
Assessments are made using assumptions  described in the PGN Workplan and Budget 2019  that referred to the Amended State Budget’s  projection of 5.4% growth in the national economy  and an inflation rate of 3.5%.
In 2019, data from  Statistics Indonesia stated that the actual economic  growth was 4.97% and inflation was 2.7%.
The assumed ICP in the Workplan and Budget  2019 was projected to be US$60.8 per barrel.
The  ICP assumption was less than the actual price of  US$68.2 per barrel in 2018.
Global oil prices tended  to be weak due to declining demands and increased  adoption of alternative energy sources.
Commerce assumption for natural gas sales in  the Workplan and Budget 2019 was 948 BBTUD  (excluding processed gas), up from the 918 BBTUD  achieved in 2018.
In 2019, the actual natural gas  sales improved to 949 BBTUD.4.
Management’s Assessment and Decisions on  Such Effects a.
The Management assessed the risks on matters that  may significantly affect PGN’s business continuity.
Based on its risk assessments, PGN has taken  business continuity measures, as follows: • Prepared natural gas supply and infrastructure  to fulfil the Government’s appointment for the  Government Jargas program.
• Managed upstream production portfolio, such  as crude oil, natural gas, and LPG, according to  energy commodity prices as well as increasing  upstream production by drilling new wells in  existing production fields.
• Prepared a more competitive marketing strategy  to improve retention of existing customers using  offers such as free surcharge as well as improving  customer service and network reliability.
• Constructed pipeline networks connected to  end-users to add new subscriptions in existing  service areas and expanded to new markets.
• Synergized activities between PGN and the Group  to achieve PGN’s strategic goals with emphasis on  efficiency, effectiveness, tax saving, and through  Good Corporate Governance.
The mitigation measures enabled PGN to maintain its  sales volume amid a decline in national gas consumption.
The measures also created a solid foundation for the  Company’s growth in the future.
