The	mining	 sector,	including	 minerals	 and	coal	(minerba)	 will	 still	be	one	of	the	mainstays	 of	Indonesian	 state	revenue	 in		the	 next few years.
There will be several prime mining commodities and	Nickel,	which	is	produced	by	PT	 Vale,	is	one	of	them.
Non-Tax	 State	Revenue	 ("PNBP")	 from	mineral	 and	coal	 	 (minerba)	 sector	in	2019	decreased	 compared	 to	the	previous	 year.
Throughout 2019, the total PNBP collection  from mining sector	was	IDR45.02	 trillion,	 9.96%	lower	compared	 to	the	 number	collected	in	2018	of	IDR50	trillion.
Nevertheless, the realization of PNBP from mining sector  slightly exceeded the target set in the 2019  state budget ("APBN")	of	IDR43.26	trillion	[1].
This achievement was the result of the Government's  commitment to supporting the development and investment of mineral mining, while continuing to pay attention to environmental	 preservation.
Since	2018	mineral	 mining	 has	 shown positive growth as a result of several Government policies.
The	Presidential	 Regulation	 ("Perpres")	 No.	55/2019	 concerning	 Battery-powered	 Electric	 Vehicles	 for	the	Road	 Transportation Program, and the policy for accelerating the  low grade ore export ban to January 1, 2020 have provided positive sentiments to support the performance of nickel mining	companies,	including	PT	 Vale.
PT	Vale	Indonesia	 Tbk	is	committed	 to	long-term	 investments	 in	Indonesia.
The world needs nickel as a material for producing stainless steel, alloy, plating, batteries and other materials used in the construction, automotive and energy industries.
Currently several countries supply the world’s nickel needs, and Indonesia	hold	20%	shares	of	the	world	nickel	export	market.
The world nickel market in 2019 is growing as the demand  and supply of nickel products increase.
The demand increase comes from the stainless steel industry, while the increase in	supply	 side	was	driven	 by	the	commencement	 of	new/ additional	 RKEF	operations	 in	Indonesia.
The	rumor	regarding	 the acceleration of low-grade nickel ore export ban which was first	aired	in	July	2019,	which	was	then	confirmed	 by	issuance	 of	minister	 of	EMR	regulation	 no.11	or	2019	has	driven	the	 nickel price increase in the global  market.
With the issuance of this regulation, starting January 1, 2020, export of nickel ore with	grade	lower	than	1.7%	is	banned.
Between	 August	 and	 December	 2020,	there	was	significant	 amount	 of	nickel	ore	 shipped	 outside	 of	Indonesia	 which	could	potentially	 create	 market over supply.
This has led to a drop in nickel prices in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Despite	 of	lower	performance	 in	first	quarter	 due	to	the	 Larona	 Canal	Lining	project	 and		technical	 problems	 occurred	 in	furnace	 4,	PT	Vale	made	a	major	contribution	 still	to	 Indonesia's	 nickel	supply	to	the	world	market	 in	2019.
After	the	 completion of maintenance works in May 2019, the Company  could increase its production to stable rate so that the total production	 of	71,025	 ton	could	be	achieved.
This	number	 is	 5%	lower	than	2018	production	 of	74,806	tons	and	represents	 3%	of	total	2019	global	nickel	production.
Global nickel demand in the next few years is expected to remain high even though the world steel industry, as the key market, is experiencing demand pressure, and the issue of	the	Corona	 Virus	("Covid-19")	 has	been	causing	 a	decline	 in	the	world	economy	 especially	 in	China.
The	Indonesian	 government policy of banning nickel ore exports is expected to	reduce	 the	China	NPI	production	 due	to	reduced	 supply	of	 nickel	ore	from	Indonesia.
Indonesia's	 NPI	production	 output	 will increase along with the development of processing plants in	Indonesia.
Nevertheless,	 global	nickel	demand	 will	remain	 intact	as	many	countries,	 including	 Indonesia,	 are	enacting	 policies regarding electric vehicles.
Nickel supply and demand in the world market has affected  the	average	 realized	 price	for	nickel,	with	the	price	fluctuating	 in 2019.
Following pressure at the start of the year, the average realized	 world	nickel	 price	increased	 significantly	 in	the	 second	 half	of	2019.
The	nickel	price	was	US$18,625	 per	ton	 in	September	 2019,	the	highest	 price	since	October	 2014.
The	 strengthening world nickel price had a positive effect on PT Vale's	financial	performance.

EBITDA	 yang	dibukukan	 pada	triwulan	 kedua	sebesar	 AS$28,8	 juta,	 lebih tinggi dibanding triwulan pertama sebagai pengaruh The acceleration of the enactment of the low-grade ore export ban to January 1, 2020 affected the nickel ore supply for global needs	and	triggered	 price	increases	 nickel	on	LME.
This	gave	 a	positive	 sentiment	 on	performance	 the	Company's	 financial	 performance,	 which	was	quite	poor	in	in	the	first	semester	 of	2019,	and	drove	better	financial	 numbers	 in	the	second	 half of the year.
Within the remaining period until January 1, 2020,	the	market	 was	in	a	rush	to	import	 the	Indonesia's	 nickel	 ore  as a buffer.
This led to an increase in nickel inventories and contributed to the restraining of nickel prices increases, besides	pressure	from	Corona	 Virus	pandemic		in	China.
The	Company's	 production	 in	the	first	quarter	 of	2019	was	 13,867	 	 tons,	36%	lower	than	the	fourth	quarter	 of	2018’s	 production	 of	20,579	 tons.
Sales	in	the	first	quarter	 of	2019	 was	13,867	tons,	34%	lower	than	sales	in	the	fourth	quarter	 of	 2018.
In	the	first	quarter,	 PT	Vale’s	recorded	 EBITDA	 of	US$4.0	 million due to lower shipment and average realized price.
The lower	shipment	 in	the	first	quarter	 of	2019	was	due	to	planned	 maintenance	activities	of	the	Larona	dam.
Production	 in	the	second	 quarter	 of	2019	rose	to	17,631	tons,	 35%	higher	than	the	production	 on	the	first	quarter,	 following	 the	completion	 of	the	Larona	 dam	maintenance.
Sales	in	the	 second quarter of 2019 was 16,966 tons, 22% higher than  the	first	quarter.

EBITDA	 in	the	fourth	quarter	 stood	at	US$129.2	 million,	 higher	than	the	third	quarter	 due	to	 higher sales volume, higher realized price and relatively stable cost of revenue per metric ton of nickel in matte.
The Company's operations and business activities include nickel ore mining, nickel in matte production and sales.
The nickel ore mining, nickel in matte production and shipping takes	place	in	Indonesia.
The	nickel	matte	is	sold	to	VCL	and	 SMM	under	long-term	sales	agreement.
Another	 policy	 that	indirectly	 affected	 the	Company's	 performance related to the second phase divestment of 20% of	Company's	 shares.
The	government	 of	Indonesia	 appointed	 MIND	ID	to	acquire	 the	Company's	 divested	 shares.
On	June	 19,	2020	PT	Vale	was	informed	 that	its	shareholders,	 VCL	and	 SMM	have	signed	 the	definitive	 agreements	 for	the	sale	of	a	 20%	stake	in	PT	 Vale	to	MIND	ID.
The	signing	 of	the	Agreements	 is	a	continuation	 of	the	Heads	of	 Agreement	 which	was	previously	 signed	on	11	October	 2019.
Based on the COW, divestment is one of the requirements for PT	Vale’s	continuity	of	operations	beyond	2025.
The Company is continuing the development of new processing	 facility	in	Sorowako	 to	achieve	 production	 capacity	 of	90,000	 tons	per	year	before	 the	expiry	of	CoW.
PT	Vale	is	 also progressing with its plan to develop two new processing plants, in Bahodopi for ferronickel production, and in Pomalaa to	convert	 nickel	ore	into	Mixed	Sulphide	 Precipitate	 ("MSP")	 which	is	raw	material	for	Electric	 Vehicle	battery	production.

Nickel	ore	mining	 operations	 are	carried	 out	in	Sorowako,	 Nuha	District,	 East	Luwu	Regency,	 South	Sulawesi,	 using	an	 open-mining	 process.
At	the	end	of	2019,	mining	 operations	 covered	areas	of	East	Block,	 West	Block	and	Petea.
In	line	with	good	mining	 practises,	 the	Company	 has	a	policy	 of  limiting the opening of mining area.
The total opened area in	2019	was	limited	 to	maximum	 2,352.84	 hectares,	 as	stated	in	 the	2018-2022	 reclamation	 guarantee	 document	 approved	 by	 ministry	 of	EMR.
The	actual	opened	 area	for	mining	 activities	 in	 2019	was	286,56	hectares.
The	nickel	ore	mining	 process	 starts	 with a nickel ore geological survey and then continued with mine planning and mining operations including post-mining rehabilitation.
Mining	 operation	 finish	with	the	storage	 of	SSP	 in stockpiles.
The total volume of nickel ore material mined in 2019 reached 12,5	million	 tons,	12%	lower	than	2018	number	 of	14.2	 tons.
This decrease was due to lower nickel production plan compared	to	2018.
The Company's mining operations sustainability is dependent upon	the	availability	 of	nickel	reserves.
At	the	end	of	2019,	 total	nickel	reserves	stood	at	107.6.
million	tons	of	 dry	kiln	 product	 ("DKP"),	 7.6%	lower	than	2018	number	 of	116.5	million	 tons.
This decrease in mineral reserves was due to mining activities, evaluation of pit design from the pit optimization process and block model renewal.
The Company continues its	efforts	to	find	nickel	reserves	 through	 exploration	 and	pre- feasibility studies.
Nickel in matte production is carried out at the processing and production	 facility	in	Sorowako.
The	production	 process	 starts	 by	processing	 the	SSP	obtained	 from	mining	 operations,	 with	 the	final	product	of	nickel	in	matte.
Nickel in matte production begins by bringing the nickel ore in  a	form	of	SSP	to	the	apron	feeders	 in	the	dryer	kilns	to	reduce	 the	water	content	 to	about	20%.
After	the	drying	 process,	 nickel	ore	goes	into	dry	ore	storage	 ("DOS"),	 and	is	then	 processed in a reduction kiln to remove all moisture content.
The process continues in the calcination zone, to convert the nickel oxide into nickel metal.
At	this	stage,	other	materials	 such	as	coal	and	sulfur	are	fed	 into	the	reduction	 kiln.
The	final	product	 of		reduction	 kiln	 process	 is	calcine	 which	has	a	temperature	 of	around	 700	 degrees celsius.
In	the	electric	 furnace,	 only	about	7%	of	the	total	nickel	ore	 input comes out as furnace matte, with the rest being slag (unused	 material).
Electric	 furnaces	 requires	 temperatures	 up	 to	about	1,500	degrees	 celsius	 to	separate	 slag	and	produce	 furnace	 matte.
Electricity	 supplies	 come	from	our	self-	owned	 hydroelectric	 power	 plants	 (“HEPP”),	 with	thermal	 power	 plant	as	a	backup.
At	the	end	of	2018,	the	Company	 owned	 three	HEPP	units:	Larona,	 Balambano	 and	Karebbe	 with	a	total	 capacity	of	365	MegaWatts.
From the electric furnace, the furnace matte is transported to  converters to remove the iron.
The liquid converter matte is poured into high pressure water streams to produce dense granules	 with	a	diameter	 of	about	0.3	mm,	called	nickel	matte.
After	that,	the	nickel	matte	is	dried	and	packed.
Packed	 nickel	 matte	must	meet	the	required	 specifications	 before	 being	 transported to Balantang port for shipment to the buyers in Japan.
The	total	production	 of	nickel	in	matte	in	2019	reached	 71,205	 tons,	5%	lower	than	2018	number	 of	74,806	tons	in	2018.
This	 decrease was due to a combination of unplanned maintenance  activities	 related	 to	Larona	 Canal	Lining	and	problems	 in	the	 electric furnace 4.
The Company's nickel matte sales are conducted through long-term	 agreements	 with	VCL	and	SMM.
Based	on	these	 agreement,	 PT	Vale	sells	80%	of	its	annual	 products	 to	VCL	 and	the	remaining	 20%	to	SMM.
Sales	is	denominated	 in	US$	 based	on	the	LME	price	formula.
Nickel	matte	is	sent	to	VCL	and	SMM	by	ship.
In	the	first	 quarter	 of	2019	the	Company	 recorded	 sales	volume	 of	13,867	 tons,	34%	lower	than	the	fourth	quarter	 of	2018,	due	to	the	 decline	 in	nickel	in	matte	production.
Sales	volume	 increased	 in the second quarter to 16,966 tons, 22% higher than the  first	quarter.
In	the	third	quarter	 the	Company	 booked	 sales	 volume	 of	19,999	 tons,	18%	higher	 than	the	second	 quarter	 and in the last quarter the year, the sales volume was 21,211 tons, an increase of 6% compared to the third quarter.
The total	sales	of	nickel	matte	in	2019	was	72,044	tons,	a	decrease	 of	5%	compared	to	2018	number	of	75,631	tons.
The sales of nickel matte is the Company's revenue source.
The	Company's	 total	revenue	 in	2019	amounted	 to	US$782.0	 million,	 an	increase	 of	1%	compared	 to	US$776.9	 million	 in	 2018.
The increase of nickel in matte production and the rise of the average price of nickel in the world market led to an improvement	 in	the	Company's	 financial	 performance.
Following	 a	loss	in	the	first	quarter	 of	2019,	the	Company	 booked	profits	in	the	following	quarters.
At	the	end	of	fiscal	year	2019,	the	Company	 recorded	 an	 Operating	 Profit	of	US$88.3	 million,	 an	increase	 of	4%	 compared	to	US$84.9	million	in	fiscal	year	2018.
The	unit	cash	cost	of	revenue	 in	2019	was	US$7,403	 per	 ton,	up	4%	compared	 to	US$7,110	 per	ton	in	2018.
This	was	 due	to	lower	production	 volume	 in	the	first	quarter	 as	the	 consequence	 of	the	execution	 of	Larona	 canal	lining	project	 and	unplanned	 issue	in	electric	 furnace	 4.
After	the	completion	 of	the	maintenance	 and	the	electricity	 supply	from	the	Larona	 HEPP	had	returned	 to	normal,	 production	 in	the	following	 quarters	 increased.
In	addition,	 with	the	return	to	the	normal	 Larona	 HEPP,	the	use	of	diesel	generated	 power	plant	in	the	 first	quarter	of	the	year	could	be	stopped.
The Company also continued to exercise careful control  over expenditure to maintain cash availability, and focused on various savings initiatives to maintain long-term competitiveness.
The	increase	 in	revenue	 does	not	only	bring	profits	 to	the	 Company, but also a certain portion of the Company's revenue	 will	be	distributed	 to	the	Government	 of	Indonesia	 through royalty payments and other contributions such as PNBP .
The total royalties paid by the Company from the start of	commercial	 operation	 is	amounted	 to	US$250	 million,	 with	the	highest	 payment	 made	in	2007,	in	the	amount	 of	 US$32	million.
In	2019,	total	royalties	 paid	to	the	Government	 of	Indonesia	 was	US$15.9	 million.
The	Company	 also	paid	 Forestry	 PNBP	for	the	Sorowako	 area	amounting	 to	US$13.6	 million.
This	management	 discussion	 and	analysis	 of	the	financial	 condition and operational results must be read in conjunction with	the	Company's	 Financial	 Statements	 as	of	December	 31,	 2019,	which	are	attached	 to	this	Annual	 Report.
The	Financial	 Statements	 were	audited	 by	the	Public	 Accounting	 Firm	 ("KAP")	 Tanudiredja,	 Wibisana,	 Rintis	&	Rekan	 (member	 of	 PricewaterhouseCoopers)	 and	prepared	 in	conformity	 with	 the	Financial	Accounting	Standards	in	Indonesia.
The	Company’s	 business	 activities	 in	2019	were	influenced	 by	 several factors: •	 Fluctuating	global	nickel	prices	 World nickel prices are linked to many factors that can lead to positive and negative sentiment, and these can directly affect the Company’s Revenue.
•	 Fluctuating	fuel	prices	 The largest production cost component is fuel, which the	Company	 cannot	 fully	control.
In	order	to	reduce	 fuel	 consumption	 cost,	the	Company	 execute	 several	 efficiency	 improvement initiatives.
•	 Government	policies	and	changes	in	legislation Government efforts related to the mineral and coal mining governance, followed by the enactment of new policies and regulations, affect the Company’s operations.
•	 Fluctuations	in	foreign	exchange	rates	 The	 strengthening/weakening	 US	dollar	affects	 financial	 conditions.
In	addition	 to	that,	as	the	Company	 operate	 in	Indonesia,	 there	are	a	number	 of	financial	 transactions	 denominated in rupiah.
•	 Royalties	and	contributions	to	the	Government	 The	 royalty	 rate	agreed	 with	the	Government	 of	Indonesia	 is	2%	of	sales	(3%	when	nickel	prices	rise	to	US$21,000	 per	 ton).

Nickel	matte	finished	goods	inventory	of	US$13.2	million;3.
Supplies	inventory	of	US$79.3	million; The	increase	 in	Inventories,	 Net	was	mainly	due	to	the	increase	 of	in	process	 nickel	and	finished	 goods	inventories	 of	US$7.1	 million	and	the	increase	of	supplies	of	US$9.1	million.
The	increase	 in	days	of	supplies	 inventory	 to	86	days	in	2019	 from		76	days	in	2018	was	due	to	the	lower	usage	of	fuels	 and lubricant and coal.

Operating	expenses	in	2019	increased	compared	to	2018,	due	to higher legal and audit costs associated with several activities to support Company's divestment agenda.
Other	income	 in	2019	decreased	 by	US$3.3	 million	 compared	 to	2018,	mainly	 due	to	provisions	 for	asset	retirement.
This	 decrease was offset by additional income from foreign  exchange	earnings	of	$1.1	million.
Other	 Expenses	 consist	 of	project	 development	 costs,	 employment costs, loss on foreign exchange differences and  others.
In	2019	 Other	Expenses	 increased	 compared	 to	2018,	 due	to	fix	asset	disposal	loss		and	 tax	costs	recognized	 by	the	 Company.
It	was	in	line	 with	the	decrease	 in	the	costs	of	 development studies.
OtHeRS Other	Costs	in	2019	increased	 by	US$2.4	 million	 due	to	higher	 community development program.
Gross	Profit	in	2019	increased	 compared	 to	2018,	due	to	 increased revenue which was driven primarily by higher average	nickel	prices	in	2019	 	compared	 to	2018,	offset	by	 lower	sales	volume	in	2019,	compared	to	2018.
Finance costs consist of interest expense, guarantee fees,  agency	 fees,	amortization	 of	borrowing	 costs	for	the	Senior	 Export	 Facilities	 Agreement	 ("SEFA"),	 and	accretion	 expenses	 for the provision for asset retirement.
The Finance Costs in 2019	decreased	 compared	 to	2018,	due	to	a	decline	 in	loan	 principal and repayment of the loan in 2019.
Income	 Tax	(Expense)/Benefit	 consists	 of	current	 and	 deferred	 tax	expenses.
In	2019,	Income	 Tax	Expense	 increased	 compared	 to	2018,	due	to	increase	 in	profit	before	income	 tax	 and previous year adjustments.
The	Company	 recorded	 a	Profit	for	the	Year	in	2019,	lower	 than	2018.
Higher	tax	expenses	 in	2019	caused	 the	Company's	 Profit	for	the	 Year	decreased.
The Company recorded a decrease in Other Comprehensive Income	in	2019	compared	to	2018.
This	was	due	to	lower	 actuarial	 gains	as	a	result	of	changes	 in	financial	 assumptions	 and	experience	adjustments	in	 2019,	amounted	 to	US$0.8	 million	 compared	 to	2018	which	was	recorded	 at	US$5.1	 million.

Included	 in	the	Finance	 Costs	are	accretion	 costs	for	the	 Provision	for	Asset	Retirement.
PT	Vale	uses	the	term	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	reflect	the	exclusion	 of	non-recurring	 expenses.
The	Adjusted	 EBITDA	 should	 not	be	considered	 as	a	substitute	 for	Operational	 Profit	or	 as a better measure of liquidity than Operational Cash Flow,  which	is	calculated	 in	accordance	 with	Indonesian	 Financial	 Accounting	Standards.
The	Company	 provides	 adjusted	 EBITDA	 to	provide	 information on the Company's ability to pay liabilities, conduct  investments,	 and	meet	working	 capital	 needs.
Although	 the	 Company	 booked	 a	higher	EBT,	the	Adjusted	 EBITDA	 in	2019	 was	slightly	 lower	than	in	2018.
This	was	due	to	adjustments	 in	the	2018	EBITDA	 figures	 for	the	2008-2018	 PNBP	Forestry	 accruals obligations that were recognized at the same time based	on	the	IPPKH	as	of	December	31,	2018.
In	general,	 the	Company's	 Financial	 Ratios	in	2019	showed	 stable	trend,	compared	 to	2018.

Cost control was carried out carefully so that the Company could still	maintain	a	similar	level	of	profit	as	in	2018.
The	Profitability	Ratio	in	2019	was	slightly	lower	compared	to	2018,	specifically	on	net	profit	margin.
Gross	 profit	ratio	was	 slightly higher due to an increase in the Company's revenue.
RoA	and	 RoE	 experienced	 a	slight	decline	 mainly	 due	to	 an increase in the Company's assets and equity, while the Company's	 profitability	 was	at	the	same	level	for	2019	and	 2018.
Liquidity	 risk	arises	when	the	Company	 has	difficulties	 in	 obtaining	 funding	 to	meet	its	short-term	 liabilities.
Liquidity	 risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash and cash  equivalents, by monitoring the estimated and actual cash flows,	and	by	matching	 the	maturity	 of	financial	 assets	and	 liabilities.
The	Liquidity	 Ratio	in	2019	increased	 compared	 to	2018,	due	 to	repayment	 of	the	SEFA	long-term	 loan	and	decrease	 forestry	 accrual PNBP paid in 2019.
This decrease in the current debt  side was offset by a decrease in the Company's cash and cash equivalents,	which	was	lower	in	2019	compared	to	2018.
The	Company’s	 liabilities	 in	2019	decreased	 compared	 to	2018,	 mainly	 due	to	repayment	 of	the	SEFA	long-term	 loan	in	2019.
PT	Vale	has	a	higher	debt	capacity	 for	development	 projects	 in the future.

During 2019, the Company showed a good performance.
This was partly driven by the increase of Nickel in matte production  after the second quarter, following the completion of the Larona	 dam	maintenance.
Another	 contributing	 factor	 was nickel matte sales optimization in line with increased production, improving world nickel prices especially in the third	and	fourth	 quarters	 and	efficiency	 in	the	production	 process.
The Company too showed good performance in applying the corporate governance,  sustainability principles and implementation of the strategic agenda.
In	2019,	for	the	first	time	in	PT	Vale’s	history,	 the	Company	 was	awarded	 the	Green	PROPER	 title	from	the	KLHK.
This	was	 the	first	time	for	an	integrated	 nickel	mining	 and	processing	 company	 in	Indonesia	 to	receive	 such	prestigious	 title.
In	the	 six	previous	 years,	the	Company	 had	received	 the	Blue	PROPER	 title	and	in	2018	PTVI	was	considered	as	one	of	Green	PROPER	 candidate.
In	2019,	PT	Vale	together	 with	its	shareholders,	 VCL,	SMM	 and	MIND	ID	signed	 a	Heads	of	Agreement	 which	marked	 an	 important	 first	step	in	the	divestment	 process.
MIND	ID	was	 appointed as the Government representative to acquire PT  Vale's	divested	 shares,	 in	fulfillment	 of	PT	Vale's	divestment	 obligations.
On	December	30,	2019,	all	 	parties	 agreed	 to	 extend	 the	deadline	 for	signing	 of	the	definitive	 agreement	 until	the	end	of	the	first	semester	of	2020.
The	revised	 2019	nickel	in	matte	production	 target	was	71,000	 tons	and	the	actual	production	 was	71,025	 tons,	about	the	 same	as	the	revised	 target	.
This	was	5%	lower	compared	 to	 the	nickel	in	matte	production	in	2018	of	74,806	tons. 2019 annual report 144 Penjualan Nikel Matte         Nickel Matte Sales Pendapatan Revenue Target Aspek Lainnya - Belanja Modal  Capital ExpenditureRealisasi penjualan nikel matte tahun 2019 sebesar 72.000 ton,  sesuai dengan target penjualan sebesar 72.044 ton.
The 2019 nickel matte sales target was 72,000 tons, and realization reached 72,044 tons.
This was 5% lower compared to the nickel matte sales in 2018 of 75,631 tons.
For 2019 the Company set a Revenue target of US$780.0  million, and realization reached US$782.0 million, or slightly higher than target.
This amount was 1% higher compared to the revenue in 2018 of US$776.9 million.
For 2019 the Company planned capital expenditure of US$196  million, and realization reached US$166.4 million, or 85% of the target.
This amount was 61% higher compared to the capital expenditure in 2018 of US$103.4 million.
The Company has set the target for 2020 nickel in matte production and sales to be at the same level as 2019.
This is due to the 4 th electric furnace rebuild plan in the 4th quarter  of	2020.
The	rebuild		 will	take	approximately	 5	months	 and	 will affect the nickel in matte production in 2020 and 2021.
By keeping the same level of production, and assuming that the nickel price at the same level as 2019, the Company looks forward to achieving a better performance in 2020 while staying focused on various cost-saving initiatives to maintain its competitiveness without compromising occupational health	and	safety	("OHS")	 and	environmental	 preservation.
The	 Company believes that nickel prices will improve, especially in the second half of 2020 after the containment of corona virus outbreak and  and the rebound of nickel demand.
The Company’s 2020 target for nickel in matte production is 71,700	tons,	compared	 to	the	2019	nickel	in	matte	production	 realization	of		71,025	tons.
The	Company’s	 2020	target	for	nickel	matte	sales	is	72,600	 tons, compared to the 2019 nickel matte sales realization of  72,044	tons.
In	2020,	the	Company's	 sustaining	 capital	expenditure	 will	be	 focused on 4 th electric furnace rebuild project which is planned  to	be	executed	 in	4th	quarter	 of	2020.
In	addition	 to	that,	the	 Company would also spend capital for the mine development, heavy equipment replacement and the improvement of plant capacity.
This improvement initiative will be carried out in line		with	the	study	for	new	RKEF	line	to	produce		 Ferro	Nickel	 with an estimated production of 10,000 tons a year.
With this combination of continuous improvement projects and the addition	 of	one	RKEF	production	 line,	it	is	expected	 that	the	 Company could achieve production target of 90,000 before the expiry of the COW.
The Company prepares the budget for Pomalaa and Bahodopi  development project in line with the progress of the study, permission and negotiation with appointed partners.
In	order	to	support	 above	objectives,	 the	Company	 plans	to	 spend	US$180	 million	 for	both	sustaining	 and	growth	 capital	 expenditure.
When assessing its business prospects and business continuity, the Company uses assumptions that are considered relevant to the industry and the global and national circumstances.
Nickel is a much sought after industrial metal, especially for  the stainless steel industry.
Woodmac, in a publication related to Global Nickel long term outlook for Q4 2019, said that World Nickel Consumption was projected to increase by 6% in 2019, mainly due to the increased production of stainless steel in China.
Nickel's long-term growth will be dominated by demand from stainless steel industry and also driven by accelerated demand from the battery industry for electric vehicles.
Stainless	 steel	will	remain	 the	main	consumer	 of	 nickel.
In	the	first	half	of	2019,	the	price	of	nickel	 came under pressure from the global stainless steel industry and	the	increasing	 number	 of	Indonesian	 nickel	smelters	 being	 completed.
That caused growing concerns of possible over supply	 in	the	market.
In	mid-2019,	 rumors	 about	Indonesian	 nickel ore exports ban began.
This has caused the nickel price	to	rise.
The	LME	nickel	stocks	also	showed	 a	significant	 decrease, triggering an accelerated increase in nickel prices so	that	nickel	price	reached		 its	highest	 level	at	US$18,625	 per	 ton.
In	the	third	quarter,	 Government	 of	Indonesia	 issued	new	 regulation to accelerate the enactment of the ban to January 1,	2020.
The	market	 responded	 by	purchasing	 significant	 quantities	 of	nickel	ore	from	Indonesia	 during	 the	fourth	 quarter to create a buffer for the nickel industry in China.
This had a negative impact on nickel prices in the fourth quarter, coupled	 with	an	increase	 in	nickel	inventories	 at	LME.
The	 outbreak of the corona virus in China also provided additional negative sentiment to the world economy.
On the other hand the	declining	 tensionsin	 the	United	 States	and	China	trade	 war provided positive sentiment, coupled with the Chinese Government's plan to continue to provide subsidies to the electric vehicle industry in 2020.
Policy road map in China and	many	countries,	 including	 Indonesia,	 to	develop	 the	 electric vehicle industry are expected to increase the demand for nickel.
The use of nickel in the electric battery powered vehicles	 industry	 will	increase	 significantly	 due	to	a	change	 in	 battery technology that needs larger nickel composition.
This will lower battery costs and increase the energy density.
Overall, the average nickel price during 2019 was higher than  in	2018.
The	current	 nickel	market	 conditions,	 and	the	growing	 need for stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries has created a business opportunity for the Company and provide solid	business	 case	for	its	expansion	 plans	in	Sorowako,	 Bahodopi	 and	Pomalaa.
For	Sorowako,	 the	expansion	 plan	is	 part of Company's commitment to increase production up to	25%,	as	mandated	 by	COW	amendment.
This	growth	 plan	 will involve investment in several continuous improvements project	 and	building	 an	additional	 RKEF	production	 line	with	 an	additional	 annual	 production	 level	of	around	 10,000	tons.
It	 is expected that the production target of 90,000 tons of nickel  2019 annual report 148 tambahan	 satu	lini	produksi	 RKEF	dengan	 tingkat	 produksi	 tambahan sekitar 10.000 ton.
can be achieved before the expiry of the COW.
The Company is also continuing its development plans for the Bahodopi Block, Central	 Sulawesi	 and	the	Pomalaa	 Block,	Southeast	 Sulawesi.
By the end of the reporting period, the company has entered the	final	stage	of	feasibility	 study		for	the	two	development	 projects and continued the negotiation with prospective strategic partners including the Chinese nickel processing company	 for	the	Bahodopi	 Block,	and	Sumitomo	 Metal	Mining	 Co.
for	the	Pomalaa	 Block.
The	next	step	is	to	get	final	 investment decision for both projects, to obtain all required permits	and	start	the	financing	process	for	these	projects.
The Company’s future business prospects are also dictated  by the volatility of nickel prices on the world market, as well as its ability to control factors that affect production costs including fuel consumption.
The Company follows a risk control approach to reduce potential losses due to volatility in	nickel	and	fuel	prices.
Simultaneously,	 the	Company	 also	 follows	 efficiency	 programs	 to	reduce	 production	 costs	to	the	 lowest possible level, so that it remains competitive regardless of world nickel price movements.
The decline in overall fuel prices	and	the	decline	 in	fuel	consumption	 of	HSFO	and	coal,	 helped the Company control costs in 2019.
The fuel costs has reached	30%	of	production	costs	in	recent	years.
The Company’s business prospects and business continuity are	also	influenced	 by	the	availability	 of	nickel	ore	reserves.
To increase nickel ore reserves, the Company carries out exploration	 activities.
In	2019	the	Company	 spent	US$8.5	 million	 to	finance	 exploration	 activities	 in	the	COW	areas.
Exploration	 activities	 was	carried	 out	by	PT	Vale,	together	 with	 third	parties	(drilling	 contractors),	 to	obtain	a	complete	 laterite	 profile.
Exploration	activities	carried	out	included: •	 The	Sorowako	Block	drilling	25m	and	50m	in		 West	Block	Sorowako •	 The	 Sorowako	 Outer	Area	Block	drilling	 200m	in	Petea	east	 hill,	Lampesue	north	hill	and	Gaharu	Larona	hill.

There	is	no	conflict	 of	interest	 in	the	 implementation of this divestment. 2019 annual report 154 perubahan Ketentuan p eraturan p erundang-undangan  yang Berpengaruh Signifikan Terhadap Perseroan  Amendments to Laws and Regulations With A Significant Effect On the  Company PERUBAHAN  PERATURAN  PERUNDANG-UNDANGAN  TAHUN  2019 DAN  PENGARUHN yA TERHADAP  PERSEROAN Amendments	 To	Laws	and	Regulations	 With	A	Significant	Effect	On	the	Company Noperaturan p erundang- undangan Laws	and	Regulationspengaruh t erhadap perseroan Impact	to	the	Company 1.
As	an	implementation	 of	the	Government’s	 16th	 Economic	 Policy	Package,	 on	January	 10,	2019,	 the Government issued Government Regulation No.	1	of	2019	on	Export	 Proceeds	 from	Natural	 Resources	 Development,	 Management	 and/or	 Processing	 Activities,	 as	further	 implemented	 under	Bank	of	Indonesia	 Regulation	 No.	21/3/ PBI/2019	 and	Minister	 of	Finance	 Decree	 No.	1523/2019.
This	regulation	 sets	out	the	 arrangements for the deposit and use of proceeds from the export of natural resources from Indonesia.
Based	on	the	above	regulations,	 the	 Company’s export proceeds must now be parked onshore	 within	 a	specific	 account	 maintained	 with	a	foreign	 exchange	 bank	in	Indonesia	 and	 can	only	be	sent	offshore	 for	specific	 purposes.
Considering that this new regulation impacted the facility agreement between the Company and Mizuho	 Bank,	Ltd	and	Bank	of	Tokyo-Mitsubishi	 UFJ,	Ltd	for	the	Karebbe	 project,	 which	expired	 in	 August	 2019,	the	Company	 made	early	repayment	 of the facility.2.
Ministry	 of	EMR	Regulation	 11/2019	 was	issued	 to accelerate the ban on export of nickel ore with content	 below	1.7%	to	1	January	 2020.
Under	 the previous regulation, mining companies were allowed to export nickel ore with content below	1.7%	until	11	January	 2022,	subject	 to	the	 progress of the company's smelter construction in Indonesia.
While there is no direct impact to the Company  (as	the	Company	 does	not	conduct	 any	ore	export	 activities),	 the	ore	export	ban	acceleration	 might	 positively impact the global nickel price, which would give positive impact to the Company.
As	an	implementation	 of	Ministry	 of	EMR	 Regulation	 11/2019,	 the	Ministry	 of	EMR	issued	 Decree	 154,	which	 sets	out	further	 details	 of	 how	the	Ministry	 of	EMR	will	seek	to	sanction	 companies that fail to construct, or procure the construction	 of,	smelters	 in	Indonesia	 within	the	 approved timeline.
Again,	 while	there	is	no	direct	impact	 to	the	 Company, the ore export ban acceleration and  the government’s seriousness in implementing smelter	 construction	 in	Indonesia	 might	positively	 impact the global nickel price, which would give positive impact to the Company. 6.
Ten	years	after	the	issuance	 of	Law	No.	24	of	2009	 on	National	 Flag,	Language,	 Emblem	 and	National	 Enthem,	 the	President	 issued	 Presidential	 Regulation	 93	as	the	implementing	 regulation.
Presidential	 Regulation	 63	details	 the	extent	 of	 the	necessity	 to	use	Indonesian	 language,	 such	 as in contracts and memoranda of understanding.
The Company will need to comply with the requirements under this Presidential Regulation 63.
This	standard	 addresses	 the	classification	 and	measurement	 of	financial	 assets	and	liabilities,	 new	impairment	 model	 and	new	rules	for	hedge	accounting.
The	new	classification	 and	new	impairment	 model	 under	 PSAK	71	have	an	 immaterial impact to the measurement and the provision for	impairment	 of	financial	 assets	previously	 recognised	 based	on	PSAK	55	-	Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 measurement.
As	at	December	 31,	2019	and	2018,	the	Group	only	had	 financial	 assets	classified	 as	loans	and	receivables	 under	 PSAK	55.
Those	financial	 assets	meet	the	PSAK	71	criteria	 for	classification	 at	amortized	 cost,	because	 these	financial	 instruments are held within a business model whose objective	is	 to	collect	the	cash	flows,	which	represent	 solely	 payments of principal and interest.
For the impairment model, the Group has calculated expected credit losses on	financial	 assets	and	determined	 that	the	amount	 is	not	 material.
This standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It	replaces	 PSAK	23	-	Revenue	 and	PSAK	34	-	 Construction Contracts.
The	adoption	 of	PSAK	72	results	in	no	impact	 on	revenue	 that	was	previously	 recognised	 under	PSAK	23	as	the	Group	 has only a single performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition is at the same point in time.
Under	PSAK	73,	the	distinction	 between	 operating	 and	 finance	 leases	is	removed.
The	standard	 requires	 the	right- of-use	of	the	leased	asset	and	a	financial	 liability	 to	pay	 rentals to be recognised.
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.
The	Group	applies	 PSAK	73	using	the	simplified	 approach.
At	transition	 period,	 lease	liabilities	 were	measured	 at	 the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2019.
Right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments.
There was no adjustment to the Group’s retained earnings as the Group elected to measure the right-of-use assets at an amount equal to the lease liability.
Several	 new/revised	 SFASs	and	ISAKs	have	been	issued	but	 were not yet effective as of January 1, 2019 and have not been applied	in	preparing	these	financial	statements: •	 ISAK	 35	–	Presentation	 of	Financial	 Statements	 for	Non- profit	Oriented	Entities •	 PSAK	 1	(2019	Annual	 Improvement)	 –	Presentation	 of	 Financial	Statements •	 Amendments	 to	PSAK	1:	Presentation	 of	Financial	 Statements •	 Amendments	 to	PSAK	15:	Investments	 in	Associates	 and	 Joint	Ventures •	 Amendments	to	PSAK	62:	Insurance	Contracts •	 PSAK	112:	Accounting	for	Endowments The above new standards amendments, annual improvements,  and interpretations will be effecting starting January 1, 2020, except	 for	PSAK	112	which	will	only	be	effective	 starting	 January 1, 2021.
As	of	the	issuance	 of	these	consolidated	 financial	 statements,	 management is evaluating the impact the future adoption  of these standards may have on the Group’s consolidated financial	position	and	operating	results.
