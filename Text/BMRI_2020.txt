PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 214 215 2020 Annual Report Economic Review Almost all countries in the world  experienced a recession, including the  United States, Japan, and countries in the  European Union region.
The United States  economy experienced a contraction in Q2  and Q3 in 2020, respectively by 9.0% and  2.8% Year on Year (YoY).
The Japanese  economy in the same period contracted  10.3% and 5.7%.
Meanwhile in Europe,  the German economy in Q2 and Q3 in  2020 contracted by 11.2% and 4.0% and  the French economy contracted by 18.9%  and 3.9%.
Countries in Southeast Asia  also experienced economic recession.
The Malaysian economy contracted by  7.1% and 2.7% (YoY).
Thailand's economy  contracted by 12.15% and 6.41%.
The  Philippine economy contracted by 16.9%  and 11.5%, and the Singapore economy  contracted 13.4% and 5.6% (YoY).
The significant downturn in the global  economy had a major impact on high  volatility in financial markets.
Stock  prices and commodity prices underwent  significant pressure, especially during  Q2 and Q3 in 2020.
The world crude oil  futures price touched a negative level due  to falling demand for fuel oil.
In April, the  global benchmark oil price for West Texas  Intermediary (WTI) for delivery in May 2020  reached -USD37.6/barrel.
In May 2020,  palm oil prices touched the lowest level  at USD462.5/ton.
Meanwhile, the price of  rubber touched the level of USD1.2/kg in  early June 2020.
Global Economic Analysis  The global economy was under enormous  pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic  that hit more than 200 countries in the  world.
In the World Economic Outlook  January 2021 report, the IMF estimated  that the global economy in 2020 contracted  by 3.5%.
The significant weakening of  global economic activity was influenced by  lockdown policies or restrictions on human  mobility to reduce the spread of the virus  which resulted in a sudden cessation of  economic activity in various countries.
PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 216 The development of vaccines had been a game changer in the  financial market since the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.
The development of vaccines was indeed one of the keys to  reducing the pandemic, so the hope for the effectiveness of vaccines  was very high.
Vaccine optimism became sufficient to support the  strengthening of financial markets.
Several global indicators also  showed improving progress, Indonesia's 5-year Credit Default Swap  (CDS) level was still monitored to decline to level 68 from level 245  at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Likewise, the  Volatility Index (VIX) was at level 21 at the end of December 2020.
World economic growth in 2021 was estimated to improve, driven by  policy stimulus and increased mobility of the people.
A number of  early indicators for December 2020 showed continues improvement  in the global economy.
Public mobility showed the increase and  expansion of the Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers  Index (PMI) also continued in the United States (US) and China.
Consumer and business confidence also improved in the US and the  European region.
Meanwhile, the easing of global financial market  uncertainty contributed to investor optimism.
This was influenced  by positive expectations of the global economic outlook and the  results of the US election which the market responded well to.
Global liquidity also encouraged an increase in capital flows to  developing countries.
The global economic recovery gradually  increased capital flows to developing countries and encouraging  the strengthening of currencies in various countries, including  Indonesia.
As a policy response to addressing volatility in capital  flows and exchange rates, Central Banks in the world generally  monitored foreign exchange liquidity, including observing the  speed of exchange rate changes and the effects of capital flows  on financial markets.
To maintain external stability, intervention  in the foreign exchange market might be undertaken in the event  of excessive exchange rate volatility.
Meanwhile, the number of  central banks implementing macro prudential policies to maintain  financial system stability also began to increase.
Source: (World Economic Outlook International Monetary Fund (IMF)   January 2021) 217 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance Domestic Economic Analysis  The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the Indonesian  economy.
The Indonesian economy experienced a recession  for the first time since the monetary crisis in 1998.
In Q2 the  Indonesian economy experienced a deep contraction of 5.3%.
However, the various stimulus measures taken could help the  economy gradually move towards recovery.
In the third quarter, the  economic contraction slowed down to 3.5% (YoY) and continued  to show a direction of recovery in Q4 2020, where the contraction  was recorded at 2.19% (YoY).
Thus, the economy as a whole in 2020  recorded a contraction of 2.07% (YoY).
The IDR exchange rate against the US dollar, like the currencies of  other developing countries, was also under pressure until it reached  IDR16,495 in early April 2020.
Towards the end of 2020 exchange  rate volatility began to subside after the discovery of the COVID-19  vaccine.
The IDR exchange rate at the end of 2020 was closed at  IDR14,050 and continued to be stable.
The significant slowdown  in economic activity was reflected in the inflation rate throughout  2020 which was recorded to have decreased to 1.68% year-on-year  compared to inflation in 2019 of 2.59% (YoY).
Apart from falling inflation, weakening domestic economic  activity resulted in lower demand for imported goods.
This caused  Indonesia's trade balance throughout 2020 to record a quite high  surplus reaching USD21.73 billion, much better than the trade  balance in 2019 which was a deficit of USD3.59 billion.
The decline  in import demand also had a positive impact on the current account  balance.
Indonesia's current account balance in Q3 2020 recorded a  surplus of USD964 million, or 0.36% of GDP , representing a surplus  for the first time since Q3 2011.
The maintained inflation rate, the strengthening trend in the  exchange rate towards the end of the year, and the improvement  in current account and trade balance indicators provided room for  Bank Indonesia (BI) to implement a very accommodative policy  mix to ensure adequate liquidity of the banking system.
In 2020,  Bank Indonesia lowered the BI 7 Days Reverse Repo Rate policy  rate by 125 bps to 3.75%, which was the lowest level in history  undertaken to accelerate national economic recovery.
In addition,  Bank Indonesia throughout 2020 conducted a liquidity injection  or quantitative easing of up to IDR726.57 trillion, which included  a decrease in the statutory reserve requirement (GWM) of IDR155  trillion and a monetary expansion of IDR555.77 trillion to ensure  adequate liquidity in the banking system.
Source: BPS Official Statistics News February 2021, Quarter III Monetary Policy Report  2020 by Bank Indonesia, Indonesian Banking Statistics November 2020Analysis of Banking Industry  The conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020 had  brought a significant impact on overall banking performance, in  line with weak domestic demand and banking prudence.
This was  indicated by the relatively low demand for credit, so that credit  growth was not as fast as fund growth.
Until December 2020, the  growth of contracted industrial credit was 2.41% while the growth  in deposits was 11.11%, which was driven by growth in current  accounts of 15.10%, savings of 11.74%, and deposits of 8.39%.
It was  expected that in the future banking inter-investment would begin  to recover in line with the Government's program in the context  of national economic recovery.
Currently, corporate performance  had improved, as reflected in the improvement in sales and  repayment indicators in the majority of the business world in Q3  2020, and was predicted to continue driven by improvements in  the domestic and global economy.
Bank Indonesia would continue  with the accommodative macro prudential policy, by continuously  strengthening synergy and policy coordination with the Government  and other financial authorities, to promote recovery in banking  intermediation performance in the context of promoting economic  recovery.
Currently, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of banks in December  2020 is still sufficient, reaching 23.89% and banking liquidity is  currently quite loose, as reflected in the ratio of Liquid Assets to  TPF (AL / DPK) which reached 31.64%.
In addition, the gross non- performing loan (NPL) ratio increased by 53bps YoY to reach 3.06%  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which triggered an increase in  bad loans.
In addition, the bank's LDR ratio is at the level of 82.54%.
In response to such conditions, Bank Indonesia also adjusted the 7  Day interest rate as of December 2020 to reach 3.75%, a decrease of  1.25% YoY from December 2019 which reached 5.00%.
Several strategies can be taken by banks to respond to uncertainties  that would still occur in the future, through: (1) Loans focuses on  sectors that were fast recovery, for example sectors related to daily  needs such as the food and beverages sector, telecommunications  , agriculture  and food and beverage trade, (2) Utilizing sufficient  liquidity in the market by reducing cost of funds and encouraging  the growth of cheap funds, (3) Maintaining the coverage ratio and  cost of credit at optimal levels to anticipate a decline in credit  quality and (5) Continuing Operational cost efficiency in structural  and long term.

PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 240 Competitive Advantages and Innovation of Retail Banking  Segments  Bank Mandiri's participation in the National Economic Recovery  (NER) program was aimed at customers affected by the COVID-19  pandemic.

- PEN credit disbursement by Mikro Banking Segment reaching  to IDR20.64 trillion to 259,137 debtors Opportunities for growth in 2020 came from changes in consumer  behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic where consumers were  increasingly comfortable using technology, both for business  development and consumption.
To that end, Bank Mandiri  was increasingly taking advantage of several technological  developments that had been carried out in the previous period  to maintain the quality of business growth in the Retail Banking  Segment.
In addition, Bank Mandiri also utilized several virtual  events to attract the interest of people who need consumptive credit  facilities.
Focusing on the payroll-based segment and cultivating  value chains were the main strategies for Bank Mandiri's growth in  2020.
Strategy in 2020 Retail Banking Segments 2020 was a year full of challenges.
The COVID-19 pandemic  changed people's behavior in consuming.
The pandemic also posed a big challenge to MSME actors in Indonesia.
In 2020, Retail  Banking credit focused on selective growth in order to maintain  healthy credit quality.
However, Bank Mandiri continued to make  several breakthroughs in digital services and business process  improvements to reach and meet the needs of the Retail Banking  segment customers during this pandemic.
A breakthrough in micro segment productive business credit  application services was through the implementation of Mandiri  Pintar, where there was an instant approval feature for applications  for productive micro credit.
In addition, Bank Mandiri also actively  collaborated with some of the largest e-commerce companies in  Indonesia to reach a wider target market.
For example, currently  Bank Mandiri collaborated with Bukalapak for the expansion of a  productive micro-credit business, and submitting mortgage loans  through bukarumah.
Bank Mandiri also utilized the integration of  Mandiri Online digital services to facilitate transactions for Mandiri  Credit Card customers.

Productivity and Income of Retail Banking Segment Retail Banking productivity and revenue is presented in the  following table.

Meanwhile,  the Retail Banking segment loans in 2020 reached IDR262.71 trillion,  growing negatively 4.94% from the period previously which reached  IDR276.35 trillion.
This was because one of the focuses of Retail  Banking in 2020 was the credit restructuring program that would  run in the first and second quarters of 2020.
However, Bank Mandiri  was still looking for business growth opportunities that were  relatively safer and were not significantly affected by the COVID-19  pandemic including consumptive lending for target market payroll- based loans, and distribution of productive loans by optimizing the  value chain partners of Bank Mandiri's corporate customers.
Fee based income for the Retail Banking segment in 2020 reached  IDR11.88 trillion, a negative growth of 7.64% from the previous  period of IDR12.87 trillion, the decrease in fee based income was  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic because customers did  not make many transactions at branches.
Likewise, the retail  banking segment's net interest income grew negatively by 7.66%  from IDR35.70 trillion in 2019 to IDR32.97 trillion in 2020.
This  was because Bank Mandiri supports the COVID restructuring  program based on the Minister of Finance Regulation Number:  71/PMK.08/2020 concerning Government Guarantee Procedures  through the Designated Guarantee Business Entity in the Context  of Implementing the National Economic Recovery Program and  241 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 104/PMK.05/2020 concerning Placement of Funds in the Context of Implementing the National  Economic Recovery Program restructured allows deferral of interest payments for debtors.
Micro Banking Bank Mandiri offered micro financing in the form of Micro Business Credit (MBC), People's Business Credit (PCB) and Mandiri Multipurpose  Loans (MML).
MBC and PCB are business/productive financing loans that could help debtors to increase business scale or meet working capital  financing needs.
Meanwhile, MML met various types of customer financing needs without collateral.

During 2020, Bank Mandiri channeled MBC and  PCB selectively to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio.
This  could be seen from the NPL of MBC and PCB in 2020 of 0.28%, an  improvement of 74 bps from the NPL in 2019 of 1.03%.
Cultivating  the target market through collaboration with fintech with  channeling patterns and credit distribution cooperation through  superior e-commerce was the main strategy in channeling MBC.
That way, Bank Mandiri could reach a wider target market.
In  addition to focusing on economic sectors that were less affected by  COVID-19, Bank Mandiri also distributed PCB by targeting potential  debtors in the wholesale customer value chain ecosystem.
Thus, the  potential value chain of Bank Mandiri wholesale customers could be  better exploited.
Bank Mandiri also distributed MML selectively in 2020.
MML Debit  Balance in 2020 reached IDR65.89 trillion, down 13.58% from  the 2019 debit balance of IDR76.24 trillion.
The focus of the 2020  MML distribution target market was the payroll-based segment,  especially those working in sectors that were relatively unaffected  by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some of the main MML business models  in 2020 were through the cultivation of MML business for employees/  wholesale customer value chain ecosystem, and collaboration in  distributing MML through subsidiaries.
All of these initiatives were  carried out so that the 2020 MML portfolio could be well maintained.
This could be seen from the MML credit quality with NPL that was  maintained at 1.09% in 2020.

Deposits for the micro segment in 2020 experienced a growth of 21.94%, higher than the growth of low-cost  funds in the micro segment which was 6.34%.
However, low-cost funds contributed 91% to total micro segment funds, so that the composition  of funds for the micro segment was well maintained.
One of the main strategies for raising funds for the micro segment was through branchless  banking.
PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 242 Branchless Banking Until the end of 2020, Bank Mandiri had 134,518 branchless banking agents consisting of 122,557 individual agents and 11,961 legal entity  agents.

Bank Mandiri  also worked with the Ministry of SOEs and the Social Service to  make branchless banking agents as social assistance distribution  agents, the Farmer's Card program, the Family Hope Program  (PKH) and Non-Cash Food Assistance (NCFA), and Village-Owned  Enterprises (VOE).
Small Medium Enterprises (SME) Bank Mandiri offered business financing to customers with businesses in potential sectors with a credit limit of up to IDR25 billion to meet their  working capital and investment needs.

Acquisition of fee income base Wealth  Management in 2020 reached IDR216.88 billion, growing by 19.22% or  IDR34.96 billion compared to 2019, which reached IDR181.91 billion.
The factors driving this growth are as follows: 1.
The growth in fee-base income was due to an increase in revenue  from management fees and transaction fees.
Management fee  increased as the mutual fund AUM increased.
Meanwhile, the  transaction fees' growth was due to an increase in mutual fund  transactions in the fixed income asset class and stocks.
Three  factors supporting the increase in mutual fund transactions in  fixed income and stocks, namely: a.
Decrease in interest rates A decrease in interest rates causes an increase in the  performance of fixed income mutual funds (with the  majority of investments in bond securities) so that  customers are attracted to shifting/rebalancing their  portfolios to fixed income mutual funds.
JCI Movement  After a brief decline at the beginning of the COVID-19  pandemic in Indonesia, the JCI movement began to show  improvement since mid-year.
The improving stock prices  led to an increase in equity funds' performance so that  many customers also made stock mutual fund transactions.
The peak occurred in November-December 2020 when the  JCI rallied and encouraged an increase in the number of  mutual fund transactions for Bank Mandiri customers more  than in previous months.
Shift in customer transactions If previously customers had more portfolios in asset classes  with low risk profiles, in 2020 a movement began to occur,  namely to products with a higher risk profile.
With the  education provided by RM Prioritas and RM Private, savings  customers and Depositrs began to shift their investment  to money market mutual funds, money market mutual  fund customers shifted to fixed income mutual funds,  and fixed income mutual fund customers moved up the  class to equity funds.
This is also influenced by the market  conditions in points a and b above. 2.
The growth of the mutual fund AUM in 2020 was also influenced  by the conditions mentioned above.
The improvement of  Performance Net Asset Value (NAV) of fixed income mutual funds  and equity funds due to lower interest rates and an increase in  the JCI led to an increase in the AUM of these mutual funds.
This  was especially pronounced in November and December where  there was a rally on the JCI.
The improvements in performance  Mutual fund, approach to institutional customers, and advisory  to priority and private customers also encourage the entry  of fresh funds from outside Bank Mandiri into mutual fund  products, especially the money market.
Besides, incoming  funds from savings customers and Depositrs who shift their  portfolios to money market funds or fixed income also add to  Bank Mandiri's AUM.
Securities and Retail Treasury Products  Securities products, foreign exchange and structured products  are traded by retail customers through cooperation with priority  branches and regular branches.
With competitive prices, a minimum  nominal transaction value that is affordable and integrated services,  encourages retail customers to conduct structured product foreign  exchange transactions and Government Securities (SBN).

The increase in the number of cards is a form of  Bank Mandiri's support to support a cashless society by actively  continuing to carry out strategic partnerships for the premium  e-Money business, co-branding cooperation with Shopee, in the  transportation sector: Jak Linko (Mandiri x Transjakarta) and  Commuter Pay (Mandiri x KCI), as well as the University.
Until the  end of 2020, Mandiri e-Money was still able to maintain the market  share of chip-based electronic money transactions in Indonesia as  the market leader with a market share of 70%.
Strategy for 2021 Digital Banking In facing challenges in the digital era, Bank Mandiri must always  make innovations to provide banking transaction solutions in line  with technological developments.
Digital Banking Segmen Wholesale The business strategies implemented in increasing the wholesale  customer transaction business include: - Providing integrated solutions using a business ecosystem  approach to meet customer needs and customer value chains.
- Easy integration with customer systems by digitizing processes  at the frond end and back end of banking services.
The initiatives that will be carried out are as follows. 1.
Mandiri H2H payment feature development  As a service that facilitates integration between the customer  system and the banking system, the H2H payment feature  needs to be added so that the majority of customer transactions  can be made through H2H payments.
The features that will  be developed to be used by customers are cross currency  transactions and international foreign exchange transactions,  including regulatory compliance for these transactions.
In  addition, future date type transactions are also developed  to make it easier for customers to manage the required  transactions using H2H payments. 2.
Partnership with Fintech      In the context of the acquisition of potential SME customers,  partnerships were made with fintech accounting service  providers so that they could provide end to end solutions  ranging from customer financial management to transactions  that would be carried out through Mandiri Cash Management. 3.
Loan Application Module through Mandiri Cash Management  for the SME Segment  Apart from serving as a cash management transaction facility,  in the future Mandiri Cash Management will also expand its  function as a medium for submitting loans for SME customers.
This submission process can be made easier considering  that customer transactions can already be analyzed through  transactions made through Mandiri Cash Management so that  the determination of credit risk is more measurable based on  business transactions conducted by customers.4.
Online Registration for Autodebit Account via Microsite  In order to facilitate auto debit account registration, an  autodebit account registration feature was developed  without a power of attorney requiring a wet signature.
As a  substitute, an authentication scheme uses a debit card and  SMS authentication, which identifies the valid account owner.
This registration process can be integrated with the company's  autodebit user application to facilitate the end-to-end  registration process.
Digital Banking of Retail Segment In supporting the alignment of the 2020-2024 Corporate Plan,  Bank Mandiri has a digital transformation strategy through the  application of the "4-Pronged Framework" as a digital strategy.

PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 286 Business Prospect Bank Mandiri views that the economic prospects both globally and  domestically will be better in 2021 compared to 2020, supported by  pandemic control measures and vaccine distribution plans.
In line  with the global recovery, the Indonesian economy is expected to  recover and grow at 4.4% in 2021.
However, there are still risks and  challenges in 2021 that need to be watched out for, especially due  to the high increase in virus infection cases at the beginning of the  year.
The high risk of uncertainty has prompted banks to prioritize  asset quality and continue to strengthen capital.
The stability of various economic indicators, such as the inflation  rate, trade balance and current account balance, as well as reduced  exchange rate fluctuations, provided room for accommodative  and pro-growth policies.
We estimate that the policy rate will  remain stable at the level of 3.75% throughout 2021.
In addition,  Bank Indonesia is also committed to maintaining liquidity and  implementing macroprudential policies aimed at boosting credit  and financing growth.
In line with the improving economic conditions, accommodative  policies, and sound banking industry fundamentals, we are  optimistic that banking performance will recover in 2021.
Bank  credit will grow better in 2021 to 5.0%, compared to 2020, which  contracted by 2.4%.
Meanwhile, in line with improving perceptions  of domestic risks and the recovery in the level of confidence of  economic actors, we estimate that TPF growth will slow down to  8.0% in 2021, from 11.1% in 2020.
In line with the improving condition of the Indonesian economy,  Bank Mandiri projects credit growth in 2021 on a bank only basis in  the range of 5% - 7%.
Meanwhile, the growth in deposits is projected  in 2021 at around 6% - 8%.
In accordance with our main focus, Bank  Mandiri continues to take various strategic steps in maintaining  credit growth through selective and prudent lending to sectors  that still have positive prospects or will recover more quickly,  including the telecommunications sector, the food and beverage  industry, health services.
In addition, the Bank also  considers leading sectors through mapping of potential sectors in  various regions of Indonesia.
Meanwhile, Bank Mandiri remains focused on developing digital  banking in line with shifting customer behavior in conducting  transactions.
As well as a form of strengthening operational  efficiency.
Various digital service innovations have been carried  out by Bank Mandiri, such as opening savings online, developing  Mandiri Online features, digital applications for MSME credit  through Mandiri Pintar and MITA on Whatsapp as 24-hour banking  information services without queuing.
Seeing the condition of the economy and the banking industry,  Bank Mandiri can still take advantage of opportunities to grow with  the strengths that Bank Mandiri currently has, such as: 1.
Strong capital and ready to face Basel IV implementation 2.
The number of physical and electronic distribution networks  spread throughout Indonesia 3.
Having e-channel products that are more competitive than  competing banks 4.
Having a one stop financial service through the Mandiri Group,  with 11 (eleven) Subsidiaries that are the leading companies  and pioneers in each industry, so as to penetrate non-bank  financial products and services throughout the Bank Mandiri  network. 5.
Having a good brand awareness that is trusted by the public,  supported by consistent GCG implementation.
Bank Mandiri  received the IICG (Indonesia Institute for Corporate Governance)  version of the Most Trusted Company award for 14 (fourteen)  consecutive times since 2007. 6.
Having the option to obtain non-TPF funding through the  capital market, share issuance (IPO and rights issue), corporate  bonds, Medium Term Notes (MTN), and Negotiable Certificate  of Deposit (NCD).

Future Strategy for 2021 Entering 2021, some of the strategic sharpening that Bank Mandiri  will undertake includes 3 (three) areas, namely: 1.
Integration of the wholesale and retail business by maximizing  the value chain potential in the wholesale customer ecosystem  (Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking and Institutional  Relations segments). 2.
Growing and optimizing business potential in the regions and  sectors in Indonesia as well as sectors that are recovering faster  and increasing total collaboration between the wholesale,  retail and subsidiaries segments. 3.
Continue digital acceleration through the development of digital  solutions, process improvements, channel modernization and  enhancement of core banking capabilities to support customer  banking activities in a faster and more reliable manner. 287 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance The financial review described below refered to the Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 which were  presented in this Annual Report.

Ability to Pay Debt and Collectibility in  Receivables Ability to Pay Debt  The ability to pay debt is reflected in the Bank's liquidity and  solvency.
With regard to bonds issued, the ability to pay debts  is reflected in the smooth payment of interest and the ranking of  bonds.
The Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt (Bank Liquidity)  In order to encourage the strengthening of the banking  intermediation function in the real sector in accordance with the  capacity and target of economic growth while maintaining the  principle of prudence, Bank Indonesia made improvements to the  Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM) in accordance with  Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 21/12/PBI/2019 dated November  26, 2019.
RIM is the ratio of the results of the comparison between  credit extended to third parties (excluding loans to other banks) and  corporate securities owned by banks to TPF (excluding interbank  funds), securities issued by the bank and loans received by the bank.
Based on PADG Number 22/11/PADG/2020, there is an adjustment  of the lower disincentive parameter and the upper disincentive  parameter used in fulfilling RIM's current account to 0 (zero) for  a period of 1 (one) year, from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021.
As of  December 2020, RIM for Bank Mandiri was 80.84% (bank only),  according to PADG Number 22/11/PADG/2020, RIM's limit was not  valid from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021.
Bank Mandiri's liquidity adequacy can be seen from the Liquidity  Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio and Liquidity Reserves.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is the ratio between High Quality  Liquid Assets (HQLA) and the estimated total net cash outflow (net  cash outflow) for the next 30 (thirty) days in a crisis scenario.
LCR  aims to increase the short-term liquidity resilience of banks in crisis  conditions.
In December 2020, Bank Mandiri's LCR reached 217.53%  (bank only) and 207,84% (consolidated), above the regulation  stipulating that LCR compliance is at least 100%.
Another indicator used by Bank Mandiri to measure liquidity  adequacy can be seen from the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
Net  Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio between the available stable  funding (Available Stable Funding) and the required stable funding  (Required Stable Funding).
As of December 2020, Bank Mandiri's  NSFR reached 126.10% (Bank Only) and 125.15% (consolidated),  above the Regulator's stipulation that NSFR compliance was at least  100%.
Liquidity reserves were liquid assets above the reserve requirement  with the function of fulfilling unscheduled liquidity needs.
In  managing liquidity reserves, Bank Mandiri had a limit in the form of  a safety level limit, which was a projection of liquidity reserves for  the next 1 (one) month.
As of December 2020, the Bank's liquidity  reserves were above safety level.
The Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt (Bank Solvability)   Bank Mandiri's Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the ratio of capital to  risk-weighted assets (RWA) in 2020 of 19.90% (bank only), a decrease  compared to the 2019 capital adequacy ratio of 21, 38% (bank only).
This ratio shows that Bank Mandiri's solvency is still good because it  has exceeded the minimum CAR ratio requirements of the Regulator  so that it can meet credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
Ability to Pay Debt from Secuirities Issued  The ability to pay debt can be reflected by the ratings of stocks issued  by Bank Mandiri and subsidiaries such as bonds, Medium Term Note  (MTN) and Global Bond.
Stocks issued are regularly assessed by  rating agency to support the feasibility.
The quality of stock heavily  depends on the ability of the issuing company to pay stocks on their  maturity dates and the ability to pay interest or coupon during the  issuance period of the stocks.
Bonds and MTN issued are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange; Bank  Mandiri and subsidiary use Pefindo and Fitch Rating Indonesia as  rating agencies.
Global Bonds (Euro Medium Term note/EMNT)  are issued and listed in Singapore Stock Exchange and offered to  investors in the United States area by complying the regulation S  based on US Securities Act.

In addition, in the face of a declining NIM in banking, Bank Mandiri had prioritized the use of fees for initiatives that provide value added  and support business growth in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on company performance, resulting in a bank  only efficiency ratio (Cost Efficiency Ratio).
CER) increased to 45.72% and the ratio of Operating Expenses and Operating Income (BOPO) also  increased by 80.03%.
Bank Due Collectibility The smooth flow of credit payments is reflected in the collectibility of the Bank's receivables.

To keep NPL within the Company  Budget Work Plan (CBWP) target (3.59%) set by the Bank, various  strategic initiatives focused on during 2020, including through the  implementation of restructuring for debtors affected by COVID-19,  close monitoring of new loans, improving portfolio mix towards  a healthier sector growth, gradual improvement of asset quality,  improvement of infrastructure and business processes, enhancement  of human resource capabilities in the credit sector, and improvement  of policies and procedures.
In an effort to prevent an increase in NPL (early warning signal), Bank  Mandiri monitored credit quality through a watchlist mechanism to  analyze debtor conditions using a number of parameters based on 3  (three) pillars (Business Prospects, Debtor Performance, and Ability to  Pay).
In order for the debtor watchlist analysis to be comprehensive  and precise, the Bank periodically reviewed the watchlist parameters  based on lessons learned from debtors with high risk potential or based  on the latest evaluation of credit quality portfolio developments.
The watchlist mechanism was also strengthened by the existence of a  “suspect watchlist” which was an indicative list of potential watchlist  debtors.
The suspect watchlist was compiled through on-desk analysis  based on several mandatory parameters, for further refining the  watchlist analysis individually by each debtor manager.
Thus, account strategy was determined early that was more appropriate to anticipate  the existence of a non-performing loan.
Bank Mandiri regulates the credit provisions that must be avoided  as an effort to minimize the amount of bad loans, which include the  following: 1.
Loans that is used to finance businesses that are speculative,  gambling, pornographic, contrary to the norms of decency,  narcotics and sectors that are prohibited by regulators and  other laws and regulations. 2.
Loans provided without sufficient financial information, except  for small loans can be adjusted as needed by the Bank. 3.
Loans that require special expertise not owned by the Bank. 4.
Loans to non-performing and/or bad debtors at other banks or  other creditors, and loans guaranteed by individual guarantors/ guarantors that have been included in the list of problem  loans at other Banks or black/bad lists of Bank Indonesia  or Bank negative lists, except those concerned considered  cooperative, good character and the cause of nonperforming  or non-performing loans due to factors that can be believed  not to conflict with Bank regulations and Regulator regulations  including due to bad economic conditions or natural disasters. 5.
Loans for companies whose managers/owners are listed on the  black list, SLIK bad loans and checklist (prevent and prevent),  or commit disgraceful acts in the banking sector.
Loans for political parties, political organizations and for  political activities. 7.
Loans to individuals with diplomatic immunity, or their  management having diplomatic immunity. 8.
Loans for the production, trade, shipping and import of  weapons outside the business entity/official institution that  gets a special permit/special legality from the government. 9.
Loans for projects or businesses that significantly harm the  environment. 10.
Loans that are not in accordance with applicable legal  provisions.
Credit Quality Monitoring in Covid-19 Pandemic  Condition  In order to support the government's efforts to maintain economic  stability, the Bank had prepared a credit restructuring policy for debtors  affected by COVID-19 through a Credit Procedure Memorandum  regarding the National Economic Stimulus as a Countercyclical Policy  on the Impact of the Spread of COVID-19 which was enforced on March  16, 2020.
The policy had stipulated criteria for debtors and business sectors  affected by COVID-19 that could be restructured.
Relaxation was  carried out specifically for debtors and sectors affected by COVID-19  with reference to POJK 48/2020 (as an adjustment to POJK 11/2020),  Regulation of the Coordinating Minister for the Economy 6/2020,  Regulation of the Minister of Finance regarding Fund Placement in the  Context of Implementing the National Economic Recovery Program  (NER), including the mechanism for Placing State Money in Commercial  Banks, Providing Interest Subsidy/Margin Subsidy for Credit/Financing  for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in the Context of Supporting  the Implementation of the PEN Program and Government Guarantee  through the Guarantee Business Entity Designated in the Context of  Implementing the PEN Program, and etc as well as following good  governance (GCG).
Credit decision making using a restructuring scheme was carried  out using the four eyes principle involving the Business Unit/Credit  Recovery Unit and the Risk Unit to maintain prudential principles and  to continuously monitor credit through: 1.
Watchlist analysis of all debtors, especially debtor entities that  were in the business sector affected by COVID-19 with reference  to POJK 48/2020 (as an adjustment to POJK 11/2020) and the  Bank's internal regulations.
The output watchlist for debtors  that had the potential to experience a decline in performance  was accompanied by an action plan that was monitored for its  implementation on an ongoing basis. 2.
Control of credit disbursement for debtors who were  experiencing credit restructuring (especially those through  the National Economic Stimulus scheme POJK 48/2020 [as  an adjustment to POJK 11/2020]) so that the restructuring  objectives could be achieved efficiently. 3.
Stress testing scenarios involved aspects of the COVID-19  pandemic condition as a support for judgmental decision  making.4.
Implementation of post facto review of restructuring debtors  affected by COVID-19 to avoid moral hazard and minimize the  risk of improperly targeted restructuring The Bank always reviewed the implementation of the credit  monitoring mechanism in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic  so that adjustments could be made at the first opportunity when  conditions change for the COVID-19 Pandemic by referring to  applicable government and regulatory regulations.

The object put up as collateral for particular credit shall meet a number of  criteria, for example, having an economic value, marketable transferable, and has a juridical value.
The guidelines for determining the collateral structure in the context of credit risk mitigation policies have been specified in detail in the  Standard Procedures for Credit for each segment.
The type of collateral accepted by the Bank include movable assets (for example, cash,  trade receivables, inventories, machinery, and securities), immovable assets (for example, land, buildings, and machinery), and guarantee  (personal/corporate guarantee).
In the event that guarantee is accepted by the Bank, the Bank shall evaluate feasibility and genuineness of  the guarantor.
To guarantee the credit facility, the Bank shall give priority to collateral in the form of fixed assets such as land or land and buildings.
The  collateral value used by the Bank as credit collateral was the collateral value assessed by the internal appraiser (credit operation unit) and  the Bank's partner external appraiser or the Bank's non-partner external appraiser who had been appointed by an authorized officer in the  business unit/credit recovery unit.
In calculating credit risk mitigation using the standard approach according to FSA Circular Letter No.42/SEOJK.03/2016 concerning Guidelines  for calculating credit risk RWA, Banks could recognize the existence of collateral, guarantees, guarantees, or credit insurance as MRK  Techniques, with several recognition requirements that had to fulfilled by the Bank.
Types of eligible financial collateral in the MRK-Collateral  Technique included cash, demand deposits/savings/deposits, gold, Government Securities (SUN), Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBI) and others  regulated in the FSA Circular Letter mentioned above.
Meanwhile, collateral in the form of fixed assets, inventory, land/buildings owned by the  Bank was not recognized under the standard approach.

In accordance with FSA Circular Letter number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 regarding "Application of Risk Management and Risk Measurement Standard  Approach for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) for Commercial Banks" , the Bank uses 2 (two)  methods in conducting IRRBB Risk measurement as follows: a.
Measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity, hereinafter abbreviated as EVE, is a method that measures the impact of  changes in interest rates on the economic value of the Bank's equity; and b.
Measurement based on changes in net interest income, hereinafter referred to as NII, is a method that measures the impact of changes in  interest rates on bank income. 375 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance Based on the sensitivity analysis simulation results in the end of 2019, the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of equity  and net interest income is as follows:  Table of 7.3 a  Disclosure of Exposure to Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRBB) (in IDR million) In IDR million PeriodΔEVE ΔNII 2020 2019 2020 2019 Parallel up 10,284,163 8,299,949 3,088,364 3,267,543  Parallel down  (12,136,801)  (9,501,949)  (5,328,191)  (3,625,313) Steepener 4,430,064 3,004,717    Flattener  (1,295,172)  (412,105)    Short rate up 3,311,803 3,025,040    Short rate down  (4,160,903)  (3,944,793)    Negative Maximum Value (absolute) 12,136,801 9,501,949 5,328,191 3,625,313  Tier 1 capital (for ΔEVE) or Projected Income (for ΔNII)  155,646,179 179,161,161 54,441,286 51,328,426  Maximum Value divided by Tier 1 Capital (for ΔEVE)   or Projected Income (for ΔNII)7,80% 5,30% 9,79% 7,06% Table of 7.3 b  Disclosure of Interest Rate Risk Exposure in Banking Book (IRRBB) - Bank Seraca Consolidation (in IDR million) Dalam Juta Rupiah PeriodeΔEVE ΔNII 2020 2019 2020 2019 Parallel up 5,956,078 3,985,147 2,056,865 2,760,651  Parallel down  (6,973,128)  (4,345,886)  (5,251,297)  (3,541,208) Steepener 3,701,632 1,926,165      Flattener  (914,319)  (280,488)      Short rate up 1,814,533 1,115,085      Short rate down  (2,657,812)  (1,941,508)      Negative Maximum Value (absolute) 6,973,128 4,345,886 5,251,297 3,541,208  Tier 1 capital (for ΔEVE) or Projected Income (for ΔNII) 172,584,551 194,621,334 62,990,103 63,556,000  Maximum Value divided by Tier 1 Capital (for ΔEVE)   or Projected Income (for ΔNII)4,04% 2,23% 8,34% 5,57% In addition to disclosure of IRRBB exposure, exchange rate risk disclosures are also carried out.
Exchange rate risk arises due to movements in  the market exchange rate that are opposite to Bank Mandiri.
foreign exchange position.
Exchange rate risk originates from the Bank's balance  sheet assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, foreign exchange transactions with customers and counterparties that cause open positions  in foreign currencies, as well as structural positions in foreign exchange due to equity participation.
Bank Mandiri manages exchange rate risk  by monitoring and managing the Net Open Position (NOP) in accordance with internal limits and regulations.
As of the end of December 2019,  the absolute overall NOP was 0.98% of the capital.
Table of 7.4 Disclosure of Risk Management Implementation Report for IRRBB IRRBB Qualitative Analysis Explanation of how the Bank defines IRRBB for risk measurement and control.
Interest rate risk in the Banking Book or Interest Rate Risk in The Banking Book, hereinafter abbreviated as IRRBB, is a risk due to interest rate movements in  the market that are opposite to the Banking Book position, which has the potential to have an impact on the Bank's capital and earnings (earnings) both for  the time being this as well as in the future.
The Bank measures IRRBB using two methods, namely measurement based on changes in the economic value of equity or abbreviated ∆EVE and measurements  based on changes in net interest income or abbreviated as IINII.
The ∆EVE and ∆NII simulations are carried out according to the scenario of rising and decreasing  interest rates (rate shock) in FSA Circular Letter Number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 on August 21, 2018.
The Bank carries out control and mitigation of interest rate risk  through asset and liability recomposition strategies or hedging strategies.
PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk 376 IRRBB Qualitative Analysis Description of the IRRBB management and mitigation strategy.
The Bank determines the IRRBB control strategy which is in line with the Bank's overall business strategy by taking into account the level of risk to be taken (risk  appetite) and risk tolerance approved by the Board of Directors.
Meanwhile, the IRRBB mitigation strategy for changes in the economic value of capital (∆EEVE)  is determined depending on the position duration (average repricing maturity) of assets and liabilities.
As per June 30, 2019, Individual ∆EEVE Bank Mandiri by  7.80% was still far below the regulator limit of 15%.
Under these conditions, the Bank implemented a strategy of maintaining the profile duration assets and  liabilities duration in accordance with the realization.
Periodization of bank IRRBB calculations, and an explanation of the specific actions used by banks to measure sensitivity to IRRBB.
To ensure that the IRRBB is properly monitored, the Bank performs an IRRBB calculation for each position at the end of the reporting month and reports and  publishes for each position at the end of the quarterly report in accordance with applicable regulations.
Measurement of sensitivity to IRRBB is carried out  according to the provisions in FSA Circular Letter Number 12/SEOJK.03/2018 dated August 21, 2018, among others as follows: a) The IRRBB calculation takes into account the entire Banking Book position by issuing equity and is grouped based on material currency positions for the  Bank b) The ∆EVE calculation does not take into account the existence of commercial margins in cash flows and discounts on cash flows.
An explanation of the interest rate shock scenario and the stress scenario used by banks to estimate changes in economic value and  earnings.
Measurement of IRRBB exposure is done based on 6 (six) interest rate shock scenarios as follows: Scenario DescriptionChanging Estimation Economic value Earnings Parallel Up Shock interest rates that are parallel to the top √ √ Parallel Down Shock interest rates that are parallel to the down √ √ Steepener The interest rate shock that marks the short-term interest rate decreases and the long- term interest rate increases (short rates down and long rates up).
√ Flattener Horizontal interest rate shock combined with shortterm interest rates increases and  long-term interest rates decline.
√ Short Up Short-term interest rate shocks are increasing.
√ Short Down Short-term interest rate shocks are decreasing.
√ Modeling assumptions used significantly in the Internal Measurement System (IMS) - if any The Bank does not have the modeling assumptions used significantly in the Bank's Internal Measurement System (IMS) that are different from the modeling  assumptions used in the IRRBB calculation report with a standardized approach.
Description on how the bank hedge IRRBB (if any), along with the related accounting treatment.
The Bank conducts hedging transactions for interest rate risk positions by taking into account risk appetite, business strategies, and projections for future  movements in market factors.
The Bank does not apply the hedge accounting method in the accounting for hedge transactions.
Gains/losses arising from  hedging transactions are recorded in the Bank's profit/ loss statement.
Comprehensive description of the main modeling and parametric assumptions used in calculating ΔEVE and ΔNII.
Here are the main modeling assumptions used in calculating ∆EVE and ΔNII: a.
The ∆EVE calculation does not account for the existence of commercial margins in cash flows and discounts on cash flows while the ∆NII calculation takes  into account commercial margins in cash flow.
Instruments that have behavioral options, such as consumer credit, retail deposits, and NMD, have calculated the material impact on ∆EVE and ∆NII by  using the early prepayment model (for consumer credit), early redemption (for time deposits), and behavior analysis for slotting NMD based.
The model  will affect the instrument's repricing time profile in the repricing gap.
Quantitative Analysis The average Repricing Maturity applied for NMD.
	  The average Repricing Maturity for IDR is 2.32 years 	  The average Repricing Maturity for USD is 2.18 years Longest repricing maturity applied for NMD.
	  The longest repricing maturity for NMD is 6 years.  377 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is a risk arising from the inability of banks to provide liquidity at fair prices which will have an impact on the profitability and  capital of the Bank.
Bank Mandiri manages liquidity risk by measuring the amount of liquidity risk faced by the Bank using several indicators,  including the primary reserve ratio (GWM and Cash ratio), secondary reserve (liquidity reserve), Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM),  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
To support the determination of the strategy in anticipating future  liquidity conditions, the Bank uses a maturity profile made on a contractual basis on a monthly basis.

Specifically for credit risk, Bank Mandiri’s  stress testing model was developed to cover the wholesale,  consumer and retail segments (modules have been developed per  product for more granular and accurate results) by referring to best  practices, including through econometric modeling that links credit  risk factors with macroeconomic factors.
The implementation of stress testing in 2020 became relevant  when the Bank identifies and measures the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic on the Bank's performance, and prepares control  measures that could be implemented.

The Soundness Rating of Commercial Banks uses a risk-based bank rating that includes four factors, namely: 1.
Good Corporate Governance (GCG) 3.
Rentability (Earnings) 4.
Capital Table of f Bank Mandiri Soundness Levels Position 31 December 2020-2019 Individually (Self Assessment) Assessment FactorAssessment per 31 December 2020Assessment per 31 December 2019 Rate Rate Risk Profile 2 2 Good Corporate Governance (GCG) 1 1 Rentability 1 1 Capital 1 1 Bank Soundness Rating Based on Risk 1 1 In 2020, the soundness of the Bank is in the “1” Composite Rating which reflects the condition of the Bank which is generally very soundness,  so it is able to deal with significant negative effects of changes in business conditions and other external factors reflected in ratings, among  others risk profile, implementation of GCG, profitability, and capital which are generally very good.
If there are weaknesses, in general these  weaknesses are not significant.
Business Continuity Information  Matters that Have The Potential to Have a  Significant Effect on Business Continuity Bank Mandiri in 2020 did not have things that had the potential  to significantly affected business continuity.
Although in 2020  there were challenges due to changes in global conditions that  affected the national economy and the banking industry with the  COVID-19 pandemic, Bank Mandiri could anticipate this by taking  appropriate strategic initiatives so that business continuity can be  well maintained.
This is reflected in the sound financial condition  and non-financial performance.
Based on these conditions, Bank  Mandiri did not face problems related to business continuity.
Management's Assessment of Matters with  Significant Impact on Business Continuity Bank Mandiri continues to assess the Bank's ability to continue its  business continuity and believes that Bank Mandiri has the resources  to continue its business in the future.
Management assessment is  carried out based on various factors such as analysis of the strength  of financial and non-financial conditions.
This analysis is reflected  in the assessment of the soundness of the Bank.
Based on the  results of the assessment, there are no things that have a significant  effect on business continuity.
Assumptions used by management in conducting  the assessment Several assumptions that have been taken into consideration by  Bank Mandiri in assessing business continuity include: -  Financial system stability has begun to recover amid a gradually  improving economy.
- Analysis of Strength Weakness Opportunity Threats (SWOT) in  determining Bank Mandiri's position in the banking industry.
- The soundness level of Bank Mandiri, which is at a composite  rating of 1 (one), which reflects the Bank's condition in general  is very healthy, thus it is considered very capable of dealing with  significant negative effects from changes in business conditions  and other external factors.
- Good implementation of Good Corporate Governance (GCG)  is supported by various awards such as The Most Trusted  Companies from The Indonesian Institute for Corporate  Governance (IICG).
In addition, Bank Mandiri is included in  the ASEAN Asset Class on the ASEAN Corporate Governance  Scorecard (ACGS) ranking by the ASEAN Capital Market Forum  (ACMF).
- The appreciation from national and international institutions  shows Bank Mandiri's consistency in implementing GCG.

Basic  Credit Interest Rate.
Interest Rate On Credit The Prime Lending Rate (SBDK) was used as the basis for determining the loan interest rate that the Bank would charge to customers.
Prime  Lending Rate did not consider the risk premium estimation component, the amount of which depends on the Bank's assessment of the risk for  each debtor or group of debtors.
Thus, the amount of credit interest rate charged to debtors was not necessarily the same as the prime lending  rate.
Non-HOL consumption credit did not include distribution of funds through credit cards and Unsecured Loans (OUL).
Information on the  prime lending rate, which was valid at any time, could be seen in publications at each Bank Mandiri branch office and on the Bank Mandiri  website (www.
For further information and explanations, please contact Mandiri call 14000 or the nearest branch office.
Table of Prime Lending Rates as of December 31, 2020    (in %) Corporate Credit Retail Credit Micro CreditConsumption Credit HOL Non-HOL 9.85% 9.80% 11.50% 9.75% 10.95% Control of Non-Performing Loan Bank Mandiri's credit quality had deteriorated due to the impact of  the Covid-19 pandemic since early 2020.
Bank Mandiri's consolidated  gross NPL ratio in September 2020 increased by 89bps (YoY) to reach  3.50%.
Meanwhile, in the bank only position in December 2020,  Bank Mandiri's gross NPL increased by 87 bps to 3.26% compared to  2019 (2.39%).
The Cost of Credit Average Balance (bank only) ratio  also increased by 100bps to 2.31% when compared to the same  period the previous year which reached 1.31%.
Bank Mandiri has a strategy to continue to grow in a healthy and  sustainable manner, while prioritizing the principle of prudence  through credit distribution to sector with lower credit risk and  strengthening risk management.
Especially for the credit quality  improvement and suppressing the NPL and Cost of Credit the  efforts conducted are as follows: - Full account assessment towards performing credit  (collectability 1 and 2) that was included in the watch list  category is followed by mapping to project debtors who still  continue to perform and who have the potential to downgrade.
- Carrying out efforts to save credit to the watchlist debtors  through accelerating credit restructuring of debtors who have  good faith, business prospects and financial conditions that are  getting better and collateral with adequate security coverage  ratio.
- Carrying out efforts to save credit to the non-performing  debtors through rescheduling, reconditioning and  restructuring, including the conversion of credit to temporary  equity participation.
- Conduct debtor review post-restructuring, including assessing  the business prospects of the debtor while taking into account  market conditions and economic sectors that are the debtor's  business that can affect the performance and repayment  capacity of the debtor.
- For loans that cannot be restructured, efforts will be made to  reduce the debit tray (downsizing) immediately.
- Improving the coordination and cooperation with the  stakeholder in managing the non-performing loan among  others PPATK, Private Auction Hall, judiciary, curator, etc.
Strategy For Improving Fee Based  Income In 2020 Throughout 2020, Bank Mandiri was able to record Fee Based  Income (Bank Only) of IDR 22.12 trillion.
This income came from  fees, commissions and fees of IDR 11.20 trillion, foreign exchange  transaction income of idr 4.06 trillion, income from the increase in  the value of securities and government bonds of IDR 1.69 trillion  and other income of IDR 5.17 trillion.
In 2021, Bank Mandiri would  continue to increase fee-based income growth with a focus on  the value chain strategy between the Wholesale Banking segment  and the Retail Banking segment which would encourage the  development of transaction banking.
Bank Mandiri also focused  on developing digital banking capability that would make it easier  for customers to transact in the Wholesale segment as well as in  the Retail segment, such as focusing on improving Mandiri Cash  Management, Mandiri Online 2.0 and Branchless Banking.
In addition to optimizing transaction banking, Bank Mandiri  also focused on growing fee-based income through the Treasury  Division by optimizing the management of net open positions,  trading securities and government bonds as well as encouraging  customer securities transactions by utilizing a network of priority  branches to target priority customers and private banking which  required investment alternatives outside of fund products.
In  491 2020 Annual ReportManagement Discussion and Analysis on Company Performance order to provide alternative product solutions to customers,  Bank Mandiri's Treasury developed products such as structured  products with the aim of yield enhancement and hedging, which  received positive responses from both the Wholesale and Retail  segments.
Treasury also continued to innovate to improve services  to customers through digital platforms, namely Mandiri e-FX  for foreign exchange transactions and Mr Bonds for securities  transactions.
Strengthening the Regional Treasury Marketing (RTM)  function in each regional office was also one of the things done in  order to increase the contribution of treasury transactions in the  region.
Response to A Monetary Policy Direction Throughout 2020, BI lowered the 7-day reverse repo rate by 125  bps from 5.0% to 3.75% in line with the 100 bps cut in the US  Central Bank (The Fed) policy rate from 1.75% to 0 , 25%.
BI also  implemented a very accommodative policy mix in order to support  national economic recovery and at the same time ensure the  availability of liquidity in the national banking system.
Apart from lowering the BI 7-day reverse repo rate, the BI policy  mix that had been issued includes: (1) Stabilization of the Rupiah  exchange rate through intervention on the spot market, domestic  Non-Deliverable Forward (DNDF), and purchases of SBN from the  secondary market, (2 ) Monetary easing (quantitative easing) with  liquidity injection through monetary expansion and a reduction  in the statutory reserve requirement (GWM) totaling IDR 726.6  trillion, (3) Loosening macroprudential policies to boost credit and  economic financing, and (4) Provision of funding and sharing the  burden for financing the 2020 State Budget.
Banking industry credit growth throughout 2020 contracted by 2.4%  (YoY) due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
On the  other hand, high uncertainty led to an increase in people's tendency  to save.
This prompted an increase in the growth of banking third  party funds (DPK) significantly significantly in 2020 to 11.1% (YoY),  compared to the growth of deposits in 2019 which was only 6.5%  (YoY).
The high growth in deposits amid falling demand for credit  resulted in looser liquidity, as indicated by a significant decrease in  the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) from 93.6% at the end of 2019 to  82.2% at the end of 2020.
We estimate that bank credit growth will improve gradually in 2021 in  line with the national economic recovery.
BI's policy mix in 2021 will  continue to be directed at supporting the acceleration of economic  recovery while maintaining macroeconomic and financial system  stability.
Monetary stimulus, including Low interest rate policies  and quantitative easing will continue to be implemented by taking  into account the projected inflation rate and developments in the  Rupiah exchange rate.
Accomodative macroprudential policies will  also be implemented to boost credit and financing growth.
In response to the decline in the BI benchmark interest rate and also  the US Central Bank (The Fed) policy rate, Bank Mandiri selectively  also made adjustments to the deposit interest rate specifically for  the counter deposit interest rate.
Throughout 2020, Bank Mandiri  lowered the average counter deposit rate for Rupiah by 5 times  with a total decrease of 200 bps from 5.25% to 3.25%.
Bank Mandiri  noted that third party funds collected in 2020 on a bank only basis  amounted to IDR 909.0 trillion or grew by 11.51% (YoY).
Meanwhile, the Prime Lending Rate, which is used as a reference  for lending to customers, also decreased during 2020.
Bank Mandiri  lowered the prime lending rate by 10-600 bps.
Bank Mandiri recorded  an ending balance loan on a bank only basis of IDR 763.6 trillion or  a contraction of 3.63% (YoY).
On the other hand, the average credit  balance growth reached IDR 752.5 trillion or a positive growth of  6.49% (YoY) Growth in deposits which was higher than credit growth  had an impact on increasing Bank Mandiri's liquidity and caused a  decrease in Bank Mandiri's loan to deposit ratio 96.37% to 82.95%.
In addition, throughout 2020, Bank Mandiri  also actively continued to implement operational cost efficiency  programs by maintaining productivity by making it easier for  employees to do remote working and development through virtual  training, prioritizing cost management by prioritizing value added  and focusing on target markets and digitizing various business  processes.

The ineffective portion of hedging is reported as consolidated profit or loss for the year. 3.
Gains or losses from derivative contracts intended as hedges for net investment in foreign operations are reported as other comprehensive  income, insofar as they are considered effective as hedging transactions. 4.
