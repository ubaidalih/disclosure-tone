Negara Uni Eropa juga di  estimasikan tumbuh melambat menjadi 3,5% di tahun  2022 dari 5,3% di tahun 2021, perlambatan tersebut  disebabkan oleh disrupsi pasokan energi akibat konflik  Analysis of Global and National Economic  Conditions In the midst of economic conditions that had not  fully recovered from the impact of the Corona Virus  Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the global economy  in 2022 had to deal with other challenges, one of the  triggers of which is world geopolitic tension due to  the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
These conditions led to  weakening trade transactions, rising commodity prices,  and global financial market uncertainty, which resulted  in corrections to the forecast for global economic  growth.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the  World Economic Outlook report released in January  2023 predicted economic growth for 2022 at 3.4% or  a significant decrease from the realization of global  economic growth in 2021 which was recorded at 6.2%.
Significant declines have occurred in major countries.
The United States was estimated to grow in 2022, but  slowed to 2.0% from 5.9% in 2021.
This was due to  high inflationary pressures that eroded consumption  purchasing power and was followed by more rapid and  aggressive tightening of monetary policy.
European  Union countries were also estimated to experience  a slowing growth to 3.5% in 2022 from 5.3% in 2021  caused by disruptions in energy supply due to the  Russia-Ukraine conflict that has pushed inflation to a  213   Annual Report 2022 PT Bukit Asam TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS TATA KELOLA PERUSAHAAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL PERUSAHAAN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Rusia-Ukraina sehingga mendorong peningkatan inflasi  ke level  yang tinggi.
Likewise, China’s estimated economic growth  fell significantly to 3.0% in 2022 from 8.1% in 2021, due  to the implementation of its Zero Covid Policy (ZCP),  followed by a lockdown policy and a slowdown in the  property sector, although China was eventually able  to reopen of the economic restrictions and activities.
India’s economy  was estimated to only experience a  slight slowdown to 6.8% in 2022 from 8.7% in 2021, given  the strengthening economic performance in semester  1 of 2022 along with the opening of the economy.
This  was instead corrected in the following semester due to  weaker external demands.
Amid a slowdown in global economic growth, Central  Bureau of Statistics noted that the Indonesian economy  actually grew stronger  to 5.31% in 2022, higher than the  achievements in 2021, which only experienced growth  of 3.70%.
This growth was supported by almost all components,  both in terms of supply and demand.
In terms of supply,  all business sectors experienced positive growth.
Bahkan di tahun 2022, Newcastle Coal Index  harga by accommodation and food and beverage by 11.97%,  and other services by 9.47%.
Meanwhile, the processing  industry that has a dominant role grew by 4.89%.
Meanwhile agriculture, forestry and fisheries as well as  wholesale and retail trade; car and motorcycle repair grew  by 2.25% and 5.52% respectively.
In terms of demand,  almost all expenditure components experienced growth  except for the Government Consumption Expenditure  component which contracted by 4.51%.
The expenditure  component that grew significantly was Goods and  Services Exports Component by 16.28%, followed by  Consumption Expenditure Component for Nonprofit  Institutions Serving Households by 5.64%, Household  Consumption Expenditure Component by 4.93%, and  Gross Fixed Capital Formation Component by 3.87%.
The effectiveness of policy applied for handling the  COVID-19 pandemic by the Government played a major  role in maintaining the sustainability of economic  recovery.
The acceleration of vaccination programs and  the right approach in applying adaptive social restrictions,  was effectively controlling the transmission of COVID-19  and encouraging economic activity to recover more  quickly.
A number of economic recovery programs,  supported by accommodative monetary and financial  sector policies, have proven to be a substantial impetus  for accelerating national economic recovery in 2022.
Going forward, it is estimated that economic growth  will remain strong supported by improving domestic  demand, in line with increasing mobility and continuing  completion of the National Strategic Program.
Coal Industry Analysis The Indonesian economy has managed to recover and  grow after the reopening of economic activities between  countries after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to  rising commodity prices, one of which is coal.
Tensions  in the European region due to the conflict between Russia  and Ukraine have had a considerable impact on the  global energy industry.
The disrupted gas flow from  Russia to the European Union has affected coal demand,  thus driving coal prices to increase globally.

Based on the evaluation results from Public Accounting  Firm Tanudiredja Wibisana Rintis & Partners (PwC  Indonesia), Bukit Asam received an “AA” rating or  “Healthy” category.
The continuity of the Company’s busines in the future  will still be supported by the coal business segment as  well as business development projects that will support  business diversification into other sectors such as energy  and coal downstream.
In the future, the Company’s  dependence on revenues from the coal segment is  expected to decrease in line with increasing revenues  from the energy sector and coal downstream.
Currently, taking advantage of the significant momentum  of coal as an energy source in the global energy mix for  the next few years, the Company continues to accelerate  the completion of projects to increase transportation  capacity to support the monetization of coal reserves,  which are currently still very large in number.
In  addition, business development projects such as the  CFPP construction of a mine-mouth power plant, the  development of new and renewable energy-based power  plants and coal downstream projects such as Coal to  DME are also being pursued to be completed on time.
The Company also pays great attention to research and  development programs that support the use of new  technologies that provide added value in the future.
In line with the target of achieving net zero emissions  by the Indonesian Government in 2060, the Company is  also committed to integrating decarbonization programs  throughout the Company’s value chain going forward.
This is part of the Company’s vision to become a world- class energy company that cares about the environment.
In addition, through the implementation of the Business  Continuity Management System (BCMS), the Company  has also prepared strategies that will be executed in  the event of a disruption or disaster that significantly  affects the Company’s business continuity.
As an integrated mine that has a product supply chain  starting from the upstream (pit) to the port/barging port  with a mine site, in Muara Enim Regency, South Sumatra,  which is ± 410 km from Tarahan Port, Lampung Province  and ± 160 km from Kertapati Barging Port Palembang,  the Company realizes that Bukit Asam’s business  processes have potential disruptions or obstacles that  could disrupt the Company’s business continuity. 287   Annual Report 2022 PT Bukit Asam TbkANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS TATA KELOLA PERUSAHAAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL PERUSAHAAN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Dalam menjalankan kegiatan proses bisnis Perusahaan,  kondisi ideal tidak sepenuhnya dapat dijamin dan  kemampuan untuk mempertahankan kelangsungan  proses bisnis merupakan suatu keharusan.
In carrying out the Company’s business process  activities, ideal conditions cannot be fully guaranteed  and the ability to maintain the continuity of business  processes is a must.
Potential disturbances in the form  of disasters due to natural factors (Natural disaster) or  human factors (Man made disasters) can be overcome  with a planned and measurable work pattern and span of  time.
For this reason, the Company implements Business  Continuity Management (BCM) as a mitigation measure  to support resilience in critical business operations.
It is expected that if a disaster or disruption occurs,  operations can still continue.
In planning a business continuity strategy, the Company  first conducts a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to find  out critical business processes in each unit, as well as  Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) that may occur and  have a catastrophic impact to terminate the business  processes for a long time.
Potential disasters that can have a significant effect to the Company’s critical business processes based on BIA and TRA include the following: 1.
Damage to production equipment and main support. 2.
Natural disasters (landslides, floods, earthquakes,  tsunami) that disrupt operational activities. 3.
Damage to railway facilities and/or infrastructure. 4.
Strikes by employees/contractors interfere with  critical business functions. 5.
IT damage that disrupts operational processes for  critical business functions.
Bukit Asam’s seriousness in ensuring its business  continuity is proven by obtaining the ISO 22301:2019  Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)  certification issued by The British Standards Institution  (BSI), with a validity period from August 3, 2022 to  August 2, 2025.
Business Outlook The Company obeserves that in 2023, the outlook of  coal sales will still be good even though a number of  global analyst agencies have projected an economic  recession.
Several countries that previously announced  the acceleration of energy transitions have decided  to postpone the termination of CFPP operations  from the initial target until the re-operation of CFPP ,  which had been stopped from operating to prevent a  worsening of the energy crisis that occurred due to  existing geopolitical conditions.
The need for a cheap  and reliable energy source is still an important factor  relying on the good outlook of coal sales in 2023, in  terms of demand.
The coal price in 2023, although projected to decrease  compared to the prices in 2022, is still fairly good to  support the performance growth target in 2023.
Several  institutions such as Argus, GlobalCoal, McCloskey and  Wood Mackanzie projected coal prices for the Newcastle  index (6,322 GAR) is still above USD 200/tons.
As for  ICI-3 (5,000 GAR), the projected price in 2023 is in the  range of USD 90-110/ton.
In 2023, the Company set targets to increase production  to 41.3 million tons with total transportation of 33  million tons and coal sales of 42.6 million tons.
To  support the achievement of these targets, the Company  will continue to optimize existing mines and/or new  mines, add production equipment, periodically conduct  intensive coordination with mining contractors in  terms of achieving production targets, and routine  maintenance of self-management equipment and Coal  Handling Facilities (CHF) with a preventive principle.
Future Strategy In 2023, the Company will still focus on optimizing the  performance of Coal segment by taking advantage  of the momentum of good demand and coal prices.
However, the Company will continue its efforts to  complete strategic projects and explore the potencies  for other projects or businesses that will support  revenue diversification as part of the Company’s future  business transformation.
Business expansion in the energy sector, both coal- based and new and renewable energy, will continue  to be carried out through development in the three  supporting pillars, namely management of energy  sources, supply chain and energy technology and  generation.
Downstream development focuses on the  completion of Coal to DME projects and research and  development of potential utilization of coal for other  derivative products until ready for commercialization  such as the Coal to Activated Carbon project.
The  Company will also continue to explore the carbon  management business by developing projects that  support the Company’s decarbonization and penetrate  new businesses that provide added value.
