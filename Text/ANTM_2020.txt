Capital Structure Policy To maintain or adjust their capital structure, the Company  and the Subsidiaries can adjust the total dividends paid  to the shareholders, issue new shares or sell the assets to  reduce liabilities.
Consistent with the other entities in the industry, the  Company and the Subsidiaries monitor capital in  accordance with the debt to equity ratio.
This ratio is  calculated by dividing total debt by total capital.
The debt  represents total liabilities in the consolidated statement of  Tata Kelola Perusahaan Corporate Governance Tanggung Jawab Sosial Perusahaan Corporate Social Responsibility Laporan Keuangan Konsolidasian Consolidated Financial Statementswww.
The capital consists of all existing equity  components as stated in the consolidated statement of  financial position.
The capital structure represents balance between the use  of own capital with loans/debt which consists of short-term  debt and long-term debt.
Capital structure with minimum  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can result in an  increase in the value of the Company’s shares, but it does  not mean an increase in Earnings Per Share (EPS).
Large  leverage is able to increase EPS, but also increase the risks.
Therefore, ANTAM has established optimal capital structure  policy in order to maximize the value of the Company.

MATERIAL EVENT AND INFORMATION SUBSEQUENT  THE ACCOUNTANT’S REPORTING DATE 1.
Legal cases related to gold bar deliveries  In January 2021, the Surabaya District Court ruled in  favor of the plaintiffs in two gold bar delivery cases.
The  Company filed appeals to the Surabaya High Court. 2.
Extension of credit facility from BTPN  In January 2021, the Company extended the maturity  date of its working capital credit facility from BTPN  amounting to US$40,000,000 to be on April 8, 2021.
IMPACT FROM COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic did not adversely affect the overall  Group’s financial performance in 2020.
The Company  was able to run its operations without significant hurdles  caused by the pandemic.
It surely needed to make some  adjustments to its several operational procedures to adhere  to the applicable health protocol and ensure optimum and  safe operations for its employees and customers.
During this pandemic period, the Company enforces  stringent health protocols that require employees and  third parties from outside the operating areas to carry  out self-isolations and antigen swab tests when entering  the mine and factory locations.
During 2020, there were  no cessations of mining and factory activities, but the  Company temporarily stopped the exploration activities in  several areas.
In addition, the Company also enforces work- from home (“WFH”) policies, especially for administrative  activities.
The pandemic also did not substantially impact the  Company’s marketing activities.
A significant decline is  observed in the level of gold sales in 2020, but this was not  caused by COVID-19 .
The decline was in fact due to the  Company’s strategies to better manage gold profit margin  by limiting gold exports.
Demand from foreign markets for  ferronickel and bauxite also did not indicate any notable  decline.
In terms of prices, the performance of ferronickel, gold and  nickel ore prices in 2020 showed a better trend compared  to previous year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant  uncertainties.
The medium- and longterm impacts of the  pandemic on the Company’s operations and financial  performance are therefore difficult to predict at this  moment.
THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS PROSPECTS ANTAM is a leading natural resource-based company in  Indonesia and having significant reserves and resources  of nickel and bauxite.
With the strong track record, it is a  solid foundation to position the Company as a producer of  processed minerals with diversified portfolio and enables  the Company to capitalize on the growth of the mining  industry of Indonesia.

Changes to the Company’s accounting policies  have been made as required, in accordance with the  transitional provisions in the respective standards and  interpretations.
Significant new SFAS adopted were SFAS  71 “Financial Instruments”, SFAS 72 “Revenue from Contracts  with Customers” and SFAS 73 “Leases”.
Impacts from the  adoption of these new SFAS are set forth below.
SFAS 71 “Financial Instruments”  SFAS 71 replaces the provisions of PSAK 55 that relate to the  recognition, classification and measurement of financial  assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial  instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge  accounting.
The Company applies the new forward-looking expected  credit loss model, using the simplified approach for trade  receivables and the general approach for financial assets  at fair value through other comprehensive income and  other financial assets as required by the standard.
In accordance with the transitional provision of SFAS 71,  the Company has elected not to restate the comparative  period.
The cumulative effect of initial implementation of  SFAS 71 as at December 31, 2019 , if any, was to be recognized  by the Group as an adjustment to the retained earnings as  of January 1, 2020.
There were no significant impacts to the Company’  consolidated financial statements from the implementation  of SFAS 71 provisions.
The implementation of the new  impairment model on the Company’s financial assets under  SFAS 71 did not result in any adjustment to the Group’s  retained earnings as at January 1, 2020.
SFAS 72 “Revenue from Contracts with  Customers”  In accordance with SFAS 72, the Company has applied the  revenue recognition method using a five-step approach  as prescribed in the new standard.
Under SFAS 72, the  revenue is recognised when control of the promised goods  or services has been passed to the customer.
In accordance with the transitional provision of SFAS 72, the  Company has elected not to restate he comparative period.
The cumulative effect of initial implementation of SFAS 72 as  at December 31, 2019 , if any, was to be recognized by the  Company as an adjustment to the retained earnings as of  January 1, 2020.

SFAS 73 “Leases”  The Group has adopted SFAS 73 retrospectively from  January 1, 2020, but has not restated comparatives for  the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific  transitional provisions in the standard.

Laporan Dewan Komisaris dan Direksi Report from the Board of Commissioners  and the Board of Directors  Profil Perusahaan Corporate ProfileAnalisis dan Diskusi Manajemen Management Discussion and Analysis www.
For leases previously classified as finance leases, the  Company recognised the carrying amount of the lease  assets and lease liabilities immediately before transition as  the carrying amount of the right of use assets and the lease  liabilities at the date of initial application.
The measurement  principles of SFAS 73 are only applied after that date.
In applying SFAS 73 for the first time, the Company has  used the following practical expedients permitted by the  standard:  − Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases  with reasonably similar characteristics.
− Accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease  term of less than 12 months as at January 1, 2020 as  short-term leases.
− Excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the  right of use assets as at January 1, 2020.
− Using hindsight in determining the lease term where the  contract contains options to extend or terminate the  lease.
− Not separating non-lease components from lease  components on lease by class of underlying assets.
− Relying on the previous assessments on whether leases  are onerous as at January 1, 2020 based on SFAS 57  “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets” as an alternative to performing an impairment  review.
Based on management’s assessment, there  were no onerous contracts as at January 1, 2020.
The Company has also elected not to reassess whether  a contract is, or contains a lease at the date of initial  application.
Instead, for contracts entered into before the  transition date the Company relied on its assessment made  applying SFAS 30 and ISFAS 8 “Determining whether an  arrangement contains a Lease”.
The lease liabilities were measured at the present value  of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the  Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
The weighted  average incremental borrowing rate of the Company  applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2020 was 7 .24%- 9 .29%.
Right-of-use assets were measured at the amount  equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any  prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease  recognised in the consolidated statement of financial  position as at December 31, 2019 .
Standar baru dan amandemen yang telah diterbitkan,  namun belum berlaku efektif untuk tahun buku yang dimulai  pada tanggal 1 Januari 2020 adalah sebagai berikut:Under the new standard, the Company recognized the  related right-to-use assets (classified within property  plant and equipment) and lease liabilities amounting  to Rp141,998,394 and Rp131,069 ,657 , respectively, as at  January 1, 2020, with the difference being the amount of  prepaid rent that was reclassified to right-touse assets.
The implementation of the standard did not result in any  adjustments to the retained earnings of the Company as  at January 1, 2020.
Other SFAS and ISFAS  The adoption of the following standards, interpretations,  amendments and annual improvements which are effective  from January 1, 2020 did not result in substantial changes to  the Group’s accounting policies and had no material effect  on the amounts reported for the current or prior years: − SFAS 102 “Murabahah Accounting”  − ISFAS 35 “Presentation of Non-profit Oriented Entity  Financial Statements”  − ISFAS 101 “Recognition of Murabahah Unearned  Revenue without Significant Risk related to Inventory  Ownership”  − ISFAS 102 “Impairment of Murabahah Receivables”  − Amendment to SFAS 1 “Presentation of Financial  Statements”  − Amendment to SFAS 15 “Investments in Associates and  Joint Ventures”  − Amendment to SFAS 25 “Accounting Policies, Changes  in Accounting Estimates and Errors” − Amendment to SFAS 55 “Financial Instruments –  Recognition and Measurement“ and SFAS 60 “Financial  Instruments – Disclosure“ on Interest Rate Benchmark  Reform  − Amendment to SFAS 62 “Insurance Contracts“ − Amendment to SFAS 71 “Financial Instruments –  Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation“  − Annual improvement to SFAS 1 “Presentation of Financial  Statements“  Amendment to SFAS 73 “Lease – COVID-19 related Rent  Concessions“ is effective from 1 June 2020, but early  adoption is permitted.
The Company has early adopted  this amendment to SFAS 73, however, the early adoption  of the amendment to SFAS 73 did not result in substantial  changes to the Company’s accounting policies and had no  material effect on the amounts reported for the current or  prior years.
