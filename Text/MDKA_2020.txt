Sebagai bagian dari inisiatif ini, Merdeka bekerja sama  dengan Eternal Tsingshan Group Limited (“Tsingshan”) untuk melakukan pekerjaan pengujian metalurgi pada bijih Wetar serta mengembangkan preliminary process This section will provide a review of operations of Merdeka’s main assets which consist of: 1)  T ujuh Bukit Copper Project (“TB Copper Project”)  2)  W etar/Morowali Acid Iron Metal Project (“AIM Project”)  3)  P ani Gold Project (“Pani Project”)  4)  T ujuh Bukit Gold Mine  5)  W etar Copper Mine The majority of Merdeka’s value is attributable to the   TB Copper Project, however, the other projects will provide long-term stable cash flows.
TB Copper Project This project is 100% owned by Merdeka.
Located beneath the existing Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine, the global Inferred resource is 1.9 billion tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.45% copper and 0.45 g/t gold containing approximately 8.7 million tonnes of copper metal and 28 million ounces of gold.
Merdeka has invested US$73 million to date on a pre-feasibility study, which is planned for completion in Q4 2021.
The majority of the investment is related to the underground development of a 1,890 meters exploration decline and resource definition drilling.
AIM Project The ore at the Wetar Copper Mine is primarily pyrite (FeS 2) which hosts copper, gold, silver and zinc.
Since  2018, Merdeka has investigated opportunities to realise additional value from the Wetar ore, as the existing heap leaching process at Wetar only recovers a portion of the copper and does not recover any of the gold, silver, zinc, iron and sulphur (a component of sulphuric acid) contained in the ore.
As part of this initiative, Merdeka worked with Eternal  Tsingshan Group Limited (“Tsingshan”) to conduct metallurgical test work on the Wetar ore as well as developing a preliminary process flowsheet.
Tsingshan is ANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 85 2020 Annual Report |  PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk involved in a number of projects that have been and are  being developed at the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (“IMIP”) located in Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Some of these projects will require large amounts of sulphuric acid and steam in their production process.
Preliminary results of the FS indicate that the AIM project  is highly feasible.
Based on a preproduction capital cost estimate of up to US$300 million, the AIM project has compelling preliminary economics.
The project will deliver over US$3.8 billion of revenue and US$1.1 billion of after-tax cash flow over the life of the project.
This results in an internal rate of return of 31.5% and a net present value of US$414 million at an 8% discount rate.
On 11 February 2021, Merdeka, Tsingshan and their respective  affiliates signed a Joint Venture Agreement (“JV”) for the Acid, Iron and Metal (“AIM”) project.

Business Prospect The continuing high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has reminded us that exiting from the virus will not be a smooth ride.
However, the fact that vaccines are now being rolled out in advanced economies means that the fundamentals remain in place for a strong economic recovery later in 2021.
Many analysts view that 2021 will be a year of recovery, but  with a more volatile path than they had hoped.
There are also increasing signs that many emerging markets will press ahead with vaccination drives, using the China, Russian or Indian vaccines.
Although clinical data on efficacy is less complete for these vaccines, many countries will take the view that the benefits of their use outweigh the risks.
This reflected both soft domestic demand and net trade.
Meanwhile, consumption dropped by 4% y/y and investment weakened by 6.5% y/y in Q3, after contractions of 5.6% and 8.6% y/y in Q2 respectively.
The sharp fall in domestic demand is due to uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
As a result of the developing global recession, Indonesia’s economy is expected to contract by 2.2% in 2020, before rebounding by +5.5% in 2021. 2020 has proved to be a very strong year for the precious  metals complex.
Prices of each of the four major precious metals have increased.
Gold and silver benefited handsomely from demand for capital safe-havens on the back of the global anxiety sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Expectations for the gold market in 2021 are bullish.
Despite  the promise of a vaccine becoming widely available and the associated positive sentiment surrounding the global economic recovery, it is still too early to conclude that the pandemic is under control.
Depending on the risk profile of investors, gold is likely to remain an important part of investment portfolios, particularly in developing economies.
The bullish case for gold is further strengthened by the ongoing expansion in monetary easing programs by major central banks and extensive government fiscal stimulus, in response to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.
These developments are supportive, as they lead to low/ negative real interest rates making gold, a non-yielding asset, more attractive for investors by reducing the cost of carry.
Finally, numerous geopolitical risks that continue to simmer in the background will help maintain investors’ appetite for safe-haven assets, including gold.
The combination of these drivers should provide a strong tailwind for gold prices, which we expect to average US$1,895/ounce in real terms in 2021.
Through the end of 2020 and during the opening weeks  of 2021, the copper price moved up by well over $1,000/tonnes to a near eight year high, as risk assets more generally responded favorably to the outcome of the US Presidential election, vaccine developments, weakness in the US dollar and continuing pledges of government fiscal support and central bank monetary accommodation.
There was additional more copper-centric price uplift from positive China's economic data and low cathode exchange stocks.
Notwithstanding some market jitters during the final week of January, the first quarter copper price forecast of US$7,950/tonnes rests largely on more of the same macro-laden support, aided by expectations of a 215,000 tonnes market deficit for the year as a whole.
Thereafter, the price is expected to decline as some of the post-COVID-19 demand momentum slows and mine production from a wave of new projects enters the market.
is now set to soar.
Grasberg has been able to extend the lifetime of the open pit, but all the operations have now moved underground.
Output is expected to jump by over 65% towards 600,000 tonnes of copper this year, before peaking at around 750,000 tonnes of copper in 2023.
Batu Hijau started its seventh phase last year.
This is expected to push copper production back towards 200,000 tonnes of copper from 2022.
In Australia, OZ Minerals has been able to offset declining production at Prominent Hill with increased output from Carrapateena, which is expected to reach capacity this year.
The company has started a feasibility study on the billion-dollar block cave expansion, which could lift production towards 125,000 tonnes of copper from the end of the medium-term outlook.
Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine: Guidance for 2021 is expected to be  in the range of 100,000 to 120,000 ounces of gold at an AISC of US$825 to US$900/oz net of silver credits.
Wetar Copper Mine: Copper production is expected to  increase starting from Q1 2021 following the development of Partolang.
Guidance for 2021 is expected to be in the range of 14,000 to 17,000 tonnes of copper at an AISC US$$2.10/lb to US$$2.60/lb.
(Source: CRU Global Economic Outlook, Copper Market Outlook,  Precious Metals Market Outlook) Comparison Between Target/Projection at the  Beginning of the Year and Actual Results of Operations Tujuh Bukit For the full year ending December 31, 2020, MDKA has produced 157,175 ounces of gold, slightly lower than the 2020 guidance of 165,000 to 185,000 ounces of gold.
Lower gold produced in 2020 was mainly affected by the heap leach incident at Tujuh Bukit, which delayed the gold production to the following period.
In 2020, Tujuh Bukit’s all in sustaining costs was US$669/ounce, which was in-line with the guidance of US$650/ounce to US$725/ounce net of silver credits.
Wetar For the full year ending December 31, 2020, MDKA has produced 5,377 tonnes of copper with all in sustaining costs of US$4.62/lbs.
This is in-line with the target set at the beginning of the year as Wetar conducted strategic review in 2020 to carefully integrate its operation with AIM Project.
