BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND STRATEGYDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, performance  in all business sectors is still experiencing the impact of the multi-dimensional crisis.
The PPKM (Community Activities Restrictions Enforcement) policy to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus has reduced people’s purchasing power.
Along with the government’s efforts to increase vaccination rates, the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia is becoming more under control.
As a result, the Indonesian economy experienced growth of 3.69% in 2021.
Along with the economic recovery in Indonesia  and the increase in Indonesia’s per capita income, it is expected that the level of consumption of poultry meat will also increase in the next few years.
This is due to the increasing level of awareness of the Indonesian people on the importance of animal protein sources, especially for children’s growth.
The level of consumption of poultry meat is still relatively low in Indonesia and the relatively large population of Indonesia compared to other  Southeast Asian countries makes this industry  still promising in the next few years.
In addition, poultry is currently the cheapest  source of animal protein compared to other  meats.
As a result, poultry meat is the best  alternative for Indonesians in meeting their animal protein sources.
Despite the threat of Covid-19 pandemic,  disease and the fluctuation in raw material prices, the agro-business industry in 2021 still showed significant growth.
Given the more rapid development of this industry, the Company has a vision to create a breakthrough through bio-technology development, which can offer benefits for both the public and shareholders and to set a strategy to maintain and even improve its performance.
In 2021, the Company began to implement  certain strategies which it believes will improve its performance in the future, namely: • Increasing production capacity in the poultry  feed segment by building new poultry feed mills and maximizing the current production capacity by increasing efficiency in the production process through automation.
• Diversifying into the downstream business  segment by expanding the processed poultry segment, as has been implemented with the Golden Fiesta, Fiesta, Champ, Okey, Akumo and Asimo brands.
• Establishing distribution centers that are  closer to both suppliers and customers with the goal of lowering transportation costs.
• Curbing raw material costs through, among  other things, better inventory turnover management, switching as far as possible to domestic suppliers, including cooperation  with PT BISI International Tbk, and develop  corn dryer and storage in several locations in  Indonesia.
• Implementing strict bio-security parameters  in DOC breeding facilities to maintain                       product quality, thereby continually building the trust of poultry farmers in the Company’s products.
• Expanding the marketing distribution network  for the Company’s processed food products by adding Prima Freshmart outlets in various  regions in Indonesia.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, amid  restrictions on people’s mobility, processed food products have become a practical alternative  food for many families.
Therefore, in this period,  our processed food business unit experienced  a significant increase.
The Company took advantage of the momentum of the surge in  demand for processed food products in this  market by maximizing sales through Prima Freshmart outlets.
MARKETING ASPECTS The marketing of poultry feed and day old chicks  of the Company and subsidiaries is conducted in 2 ways: by selling directly to the farmers and through the poultry shops in several cities around Indonesia.
In the development of market share, the  Company emphasizes product quality and after sales service which is supported by the Technical Service team.
This team shares complete information about the Company’s product so that farmers can apply proper poultry farming management in order to achieve the optimum results for their harvest.
The areas where the Company markets its  products encompasses several area in Java, Sumatera and other islands where there are clusters of farmers.
Besides selling poultry feed and Day Old Chick products directly to farmers and through poultry shops, the Company also  establishes partnerships with plasma farmers.
The Company provides livestock production  facilities consisting of DOC, poultry feed, animal health and assistance to partner farmers.
After harvesting, all of the poultry will be purchased by  the Company to be marketed to our distribution  network spread throughout the country.
For processed poultry, the Company always  reinforces the brand awareness of its Golden Fiesta, Fiesta, Champ, Okey, Akumo dan Asimo trademarks by way of advertising in several media and participating in popular events.
