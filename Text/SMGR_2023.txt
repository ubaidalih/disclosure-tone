(World Economic Outlook IMF, Oktober 2020-Februari 2024) / (World Economic Outlook IMF, Oktober 2020-Februari 2024)GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW As Covid-19 ends as a global health emergency in May  2023, world countries face a number of challenges which  put the global economy in a quite challenging situation.
The  conflicts that occurred in Eastern Europe and the Middle  East had impacts in the form of geopolitical tensions and  disruptions to the supply chains of various commodities.
High inflation rates, especially in advanced economic  countries, are a challenge in themselves.
A number of  banks responded to this situation by maintaining high  interest rates for longer periods (higher for longer).
The increase in Fed Fund Rate interest rates and the increase  in long-term US Treasury yields encouraged investment  flows out of developing economic countries towards liquid  assets in the United States.
This triggered a strengthening of  the value of the US dollar against various world currencies.
The US dollar index against world currencies reached 106.7  in October 2023, strengthening 3.0% from December 2022  and strengthening 15.4% from June 2021.
This very strong  position of the US dollar puts pressure on the currencies of  various countries, presenting risks for money market liquidity  and financial system stability.
Facing these challenges, the cumulative economic growth  of world countries is estimated to slow down by 0.4% (yoy)  referring to the International Monetary Fund report (World  Economic Outlook, January 2024).
Economic activity  is declining, with world trade volume growth slowing,  estimated to be 0.4%, from reaching 5.2% in 2022.
However, the economies of China and the United States,  as influential forces on the global scale, are estimated to  grow by 2.25% and 0.6%, respectively. 147  Laporan Tahunan 2023 Annual Report SIG mencatatkan volume  produksi semen sebesar 34,45  juta ton, naik sebesar 2,8% dari  tahun sebelumnya.
SIG recorded cement production volume  of 34.45 million tonnes, a 2.8% increase  from the previous year.
Meanwhile, clinker  production volume recorded increased by  9.9% from last year.
Demand for coal commodities, which previously faced a surge  due to the impact of global energy disruption, is experiencing  a downward trend.
Based on an International Energy Agency  report, a large decline in demand occurred in the European  Union and the United States with the decline rate estimated at  20% on an annual basis (Coal 2023: Analysis and Forecast to  2026, December 2023).
However, there has been an increase  in countries that represent 70% of global demand, including  China, India and Indonesia, partly due to the increasing need for  electricity.
Energy security is an important issue that has an impact  on the world coal industry, following the disruption that  previously occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation  and conflict in Eastern Europe.
In order to meet the need  for electricity, both India and China as two producers have  encouraged coal production since October 2021.
As a  result, production from the three largest global producers,  namely China, India and Indonesia, has increased to levels  that have never been exceeded before.
INDONESIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW The Indonesian economy shows resilience amidst global  challenges.
Economic growth in 2023 is 5.05% (yoy) with  inflation maintained at the target of 3% ± 1, amounting to  2.61% (yoy).
Indonesia’s economic resilience is reflected  in strong retail sales levels, an increase in the consumer  confidence index, and the Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI)  which is in the expansive zone.
Facing the strengthening of  the US dollar against almost all world currencies, the rupiah  exchange rate appreciated 1.11% (ytd) supported by Bank  Indonesia’s pro-stability policy.
In 2023, Indonesia’s inflation rate fell more rapidly and  became under control within the target range.
This is  attributed to the synergy between regulators.
Core  inflation was maintained low at 1.80% (yoy), influenced by  low imported inflation due to large economic capacity and  being able to respond to domestic demand, with inflation  volatile foods under control at 6.73% (yoy).
Indonesia’s economic resilience amidst global challenges  is reflected in the performance of Indonesia’s Balance of  Payments (NPI) 2023, with a surplus of US$6.3 billion, an  increase from the previous year’s surplus of US$4.0 billion.
Realized exports in 2023 will fall 5.76% on an annual basis  with realized exports of mining products falling 23.54%  contributed by the decline in realized coal exports.
Meanwhile, the Indonesian coal industry was growing in  2023 as marked by strong productivity.
Indonesia will  realize coal production reaching 775.2 million tons in 2023,  equivalent to 112% of the target and an increase of 12.84%  compared to production in the previous year.
With high  production levels, the government can more freely meet  domestic coal needs, including for electricity production  and other industries.
There is an increasing trend in the  realization of domestic coal utilization (DMO) triggered by  an increase in demand for electrical energy and the need  for the realization of the 35,000 MW program.
INDONESIAN CEMENT INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Cement industry in Indonesia is characterized by ongoing  excess capacity and intense competition, as can be seen  from the large gap between installed capacity and actual  cement sales.
In 2023, there were 14 cement producers  operating in Indonesia, with a total installed capacity of  119 million tons.
Meanwhile, cumulative domestic cement  sales for the January-December 2023 period were 65.5  million tonnes, with realized exports of cement and clinker  amounting to 10.9 million tonnes.
Specifically, bulk cement sales in 2023 increased by 12.8%  (yoy), indicating an increased in infrastructure construction  activity.
Meanwhile, bag cement sales slightly grew by 0.1%  (yoy).
Cement sales in Java increased by 0.6% (yoy), while  outside Java grew positively by 6.7% (yoy).
The highest  cement sales outside Java occurred on Kalimantan Island  which grew by 21.5% (yoy), contributed by cement sales  in East Kalimantan which grew by 53.4%   along with the  development of the Indonesian New Capital City (IKN). 150 PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkANALISIS DAN DISKUSI MANAJEMEN  Management Discussion and AnalysisIndikator Perkembangan Industri Semen  Cement Industry Development Indicators Indikator IndicatorSatuan Unit2023 2022 Kapasitas terpasang Installed capacityjuta ton million tons119,1 119,1 Permintaan domestik Domestic demandjuta ton million tons65,5 63,3 Utilisasi* Utilization*%57,8 55,8 Penjualan ekspor Export salesjuta ton million tons10,9 8,9 Total penjualan nasional  Total national salesjuta ton million tons76,4 72,2 Utilisasi termasuk ekspor* Utilization including export*%67,4 63,7 *  Utilisasi dihitung menggunakan kapasitas terpasang sebesar 113,4 juta ton (tidak termasuk kapasitas pabrik semen yang volume penjualannya tidak  tercatat dalam ASI | Utilization was calculated using an installed capacity of 113.4 million tons (excluding the capacity of cement plants whose sales  volumes were not recorded in ASI).
As of 31 December 2023, the continued completion of a  number of infrastructure projects and the development of  the Indonesian Capital City (IKN) contributed dominantly  to the growth of the cement industry.
Accelerating  infrastructure and connectivity development is one of the  focuses of the government’s fiscal policy in ABPN 2023,  reflected in the infrastructure development budget which  reached IDR 392 trillion, with realization at the end of  2023 increasing 22.2% on an annual basis.
Meanwhile, the  ongoing IKN development is estimated to encourage an  increase in national cement sales of around 1 million tons  per year.
Contribute to realize a Sustainable Cement Industry The cement industry as one of the sector that has a  significant impact on the environment, considering that the  production process relies on carbon fuels.
As demand for  cement increases, there was a strong push for the cement  industry both at the global and national levels to reduce  carbon emissions, especially in the production process.
Among the efforts that can effectively have an impact  include positive energy use efficiency, maintaining low- carbon fuels, efficient use of production materials, and  other innovations. 151  Laporan Tahunan 2023 Annual Report Indonesia sebagai warga dunia telah berkomitmen untuk  mencapai Net Zero Emission pada 2050.
Indonesia as a global citizen has committed to achieving  Net Zero Emissions by 2050.
The cement industry, as a  sector which until 2023 will still produce quite high emission  intensity, has implemented a number of initiatives to realize  sustainable industrial growth for all stakeholders.
Applied  research is the basis for developing environmentally  friendly products and applications, in order to ensure  cement products are able to answer challenges and meet  an industry that continues to develop towards a low-carbon  industry.
The Company’s commitment to move towards a low  carbon industry is realized through the implementation of  the Decarbonization Roadmap, with a target of reducing  emission intensity in scope 1 by 27% in 2010-2030, and  reducing intensity in scope 2 reaching 23.9% in 2019- 2030.
The Company implements a regular audit system  for the energy we use, both internally and by third parties,  with reference to the ISO 50001 standard.
In addition, to  ensure that operations do not endanger the environment  and social, the Company has equipped its cement factory  with air-moving equipment and continues to combines air  emissions in real time.
The Company as one of the main players in the Indonesian  cement industry makes a real contribution to the pace of  sustainable development, including through the use of  alternative fuels and thermal energy efficiency measures.
In an effort to increase the use of renewable energy, the  Company has also implemented the use of solar panels  as a substitute for electrical energy in operational units,  and has strengthened this commitment by signing a  collaboration with PLN to encourage the use of clean  energy in accordance with the Company’s Sustainability  Roadmap that has been prepared.
The Company’s commitment to contribute to realizing  a greener industry by the end of 2023 is reflected in the  awards it received from the 2023 Company Performance  Rating Assessment Program in Environmental Management  (PROPER), in the form of 2 (two) gold ratings and 7 (seven)  green ratings for a number of factories, by the Ministry of  Environment and Forestry (KLHK). 152 PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkANALISIS DAN DISKUSI MANAJEMEN  Management Discussion and Analysis  TINJAUAN KINERJA OPERASIONAL   Operational Performance Overview KEBIJAKAN STRATEGIS SIG | SIG STRATEGY Sumber daya ResourcesStrategi StrategyNilai Utama Value DriversPencapaian Nilai di 2023 Value created in 2023 1.

Target and Realization Comparison In 2023, cement industry saw a better economic condition  compared to that of 2022.
As a result, the national cement  demand continued to grow in 2023, supported by the  housing backlog, as well as the Government’s commitment  to completing infrastructure projects and development of  the New Capital City were expected to be the main driver  of the Company’s cement demand.
Even though the general economy experienced growth,  the Company sees that there has been a shift in household  consumption priorities which could provide challenges for  the cement industry, especially the contraction in demand  for bag cement, as well as an increase in fuel and energy  prices in the fourth quarter of  in 2023.
The Company has implemented 4 main strategies to face  the challenging conditions of 2023.

This is due to several factors such as elections,  increasing of budget policies, as well as various efforts to  increase investment flows into Indonesia.
Infrastructure development is still one of the priority  agendas in maintaining economic growth.
Several factors  that could be driving the growth of cement consumption  for both bag cement and bulk cement such as fiscal  incentives that encourage bag cement consumption, such  as exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT), as well as an  increase in the national infrastructure budget allocation to  IDR 423.4 trillion and the Special Allocation Fund (DAK)  Physical in 2024.
In 2024, global crude oil prices are expected to continue to  experience dynamics, so the Company assumes there will  be an increase in fuel prices.
This is relatively in line with  the estimated increase in the 2024 ICP in the range of US$  75-85 per barrel.
The Company will continue to improve disciplined cash  flow management, through initiatives to maintain effective  debt levels to maintain costs and optimize capital structure  184 PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) TbkANALISIS DAN DISKUSI MANAJEMEN  Management Discussion and Analysismodal dan rasio hutang dapat semakin optimal.
