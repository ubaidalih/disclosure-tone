CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  AND POLICIES The application of the following revised accounting  standards, which are effective from January 1,  2020, is relevant for the Group, and resulted in  substantial changes to the Group’s accounting  policies and had material effect on the amounts  reported for the current year’s consolidated  financial statements: PSAK 71: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PSAK 71 replaces the provisions of PSAK  55 “Financial instruments: recognition and  measurement” that relate to the recognition,  classification and measurement of financial assets  and financial liabilities, impairment of financial  assets and hedge accounting.
with the transition requirements in PSAK 71,  the Group elected to apply retrospectively with  the cumulative effect of initial implementation  recognised at 1 January 2020 and not restate the  comparative information.
The adoption of PSAK 71 has fundamentally  changed the Group’s accounting for impairment  losses for financial assets by replacing PSAK 55’s  incurred loss approach with a forward-looking  expected credit loss (ECL) approach.
PSAK 71  requires the Group to recognize an allowance for  ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value  through profit or loss and contract assets.
Investment in shares classified as financial  assets measured at its cost as of December  31, 2019 are classified and measured as equity  instrument designated at fair value through other  comprehensive income beginning on January 1,  2020.
The Hedge accounting rules in this standard had  no impact on the recognition and measurement of  the Group’s derivative financial instruments.
PSAK 72: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS  WITH CUSTOMERS PSAK 72 establishes a five-step model to  account for revenue arising from contracts  with customers and requires that revenue  be recognized at an amount that reflects the  consideration to which an entity expects to be  entitled in exchange for transferring  goods or  services to a customer.
PSAK 72 determines that the revenue is  recognised when control of goods has been  transferred or when (or during) the rendering of  services (performance obligation is satisfied).
The implementation of PSAK 72 affects the  recording of partnership transactions with  chicken farmers.
In accordance with the transition requirements  in PSAK 72, the Group elected to apply  full retrospective method and restated  corresponding information for prior year financial  information in the scope of PSAK 72.
The impact  to the Group’s financial statements from the  retrospective first time adoption from PSAK 72  are disclosed in Notes 43.
PSAK 73: LEASES In relation to the implementation of PSAK 73,  the Group as the lessee recognised right-of- use assets and lease liabilities related to leases  which were previously classified as operating  leases based on PSAK 30: Leases, except  for short-term leases or leases with low value  assets.
The Group adopted PSAK 73 using the modified  retrospective method of adoption with the date of  initial application of January 1, 2020.
Under this  method, the standard is applied retrospectively  with the cumulative effect of initially applying  the standard recognized at the date of initial  application.
The Group elected to use the  transition practical expedient to not reassess  whether a contract is, or contains a lease at  January 1, 2020.
Instead, the Group applied the  standard only to contracts that were previously  identified as leases applying PSAK 30 and ISAK  8 at the date of initial application.
The following standards and interpretation  did not result in any significant impact in the  consolidated financial statements: • Amendment to PSAK 1 and PSAK 25:  Definition of Material • Amendments to PSAK 15: Investments in  Associates and Joint Ventures regarding  Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint  Ventures Further information on changes in accounting  policy is contained within the Notes of the  Consolidated Financial Statements under Note  2.

BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND STRATEGY The economic growth rate in 2020 decreased by  minus 2.07% due to the COVID-19 pandemic and  in 2021, after vaccines began to be distributed  throughout Indonesia and the situation gradually  normalized, it was estimated that the Indonesian  economy could return to growth between 4.5%  to 5.3% (source: Central Bureau of Statistics,  February 8, 2021).
Along with the economic recovery in Indonesia  and the increase in Indonesia’s per capita  income, it is expected that the level of  consumption of poultry meat will also increase in  the next few years.
This is due to the increasing  level of awareness of the Indonesian people  on the importance of animal protein sources,  especially for children’s growth.
The level of consumption of poultry meat is still  relatively low in Indonesia and the relatively  large population of Indonesia compared to other  Southeast Asian countries makes this industry  promising in the next few years.
In addition, poultry is currently the cheapest  source of animal protein compared to other  meats.
As a result, poultry meat is the best  alternative for Indonesians in meeting their  animal protein sources.
Despite the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic,  disease and the fluctuation in raw material  prices, the agro-business industry in 2021 still  showed significant growth.
Given the more  rapid development of this industry, the Company  has a vision to create a breakthrough through  bio-technology development, which can offer  benefits for both the public and shareholders and  to set a strategy to maintain and even improve  its performance.
In 2020, the Company began to implement  certain strategies which it believes will improve  its performance in the future, namely: •  Increasing production capacity in the poultry  feed segment by building new poultry feed  mills and maximizing the current production  capacity by increasing efficiency in the  production process through automation.
• Diversifying into the downstream business  segment by expanding the processed poultry  segment, as has been implemented with the  Golden Fiesta and Fiesta brands, and by  building more processed poultry facilities.
• Establishing distribution centers that are  closer to both suppliers and customers with  the goal of lowering transportation costs.
• Curbing raw material costs through, among  other things, better inventory turnover  management, purchasing of raw materials  at lower prices without compromising quality  and switching as far as possible to domestic  suppliers for lower transportation costs.
• Implementing strict bio-security parameters  in DOC breeding facilities to maintain product  quality, thereby continually building the trust of  poultry farmers in the Company’s products.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, amid  restrictions on people’s mobility, processed food  products have become a practical alternative  food for many families.
Therefore, in this period,  our processed food business unit experienced  a significant increase.
The Company took  advantage of the momentum of the surge in  demand for processed food products in this  market by maximizing sales through Prima  Freshmart outlets.
In the development of market share, the  Company emphasizes product quality and after  sales service which is supported by the Technical  Service team.
This team shares complete  information about the Company’s products so  that farmers can apply proper poultry farming  management in order to achieve the optimum  results for their harvest.
The areas where the Company markets its  products encompasses several area in Java,  Sumatra and other islands where there are  clusters of farmers.
For processed poultry, the Company always  reinforces the brand awareness of its Golden  Fiesta and Fiesta trademarks by way of  advertising in several media and participating in  popular events.
