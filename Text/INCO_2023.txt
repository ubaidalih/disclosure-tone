In 2023, the nickel price trend decreased compared to 2022.
The decline was partly influenced by the weakening demand  from the stainless steel sector in Asia and Europe, which led  to a worldwide increase in nickel inventories.
Nevertheless,  PT Vale Indonesia Tbk could maintain positive financial  performance in its production activities.
The Company also  remains focused on developing its business by working with  partners to build nickel processing facilities, both with Rotary  Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology in Central Sulawesi  and High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) in Southeast Sulawesi  and South Sulawesi. 1T23 2T23 3T23 4T23 Y-on-Y Q-on-Q5.03 5.17 4.94 5.04 0.92 3.86 1.60 0.45Tinjauan Makro Ekonomi Macro Economic Overview 94 Laporan Tahunan 2023Ekonomi makro di 2023 mengalami pelemahan yang signifikan  bahkan cenderung mengarah ke resesi.

XXVII, 5 February 2024The 2023 macroeconomy weakened significantly and even  tended to lead to a recession.
However, the economy in  Indonesia is still maintained amid the global economic turmoil  that occurred.
This condition shows Indonesia has better  economic resilience and performance than other countries.
Overall, Indonesia's 5.05% economic growth was slightly lower  than the 5.31% in 2022.
Nevertheless, the global challenges  did not deter Indonesia's stance.
The Central Statistics Agency  (BPS) data shows Indonesia's economy in 1Q23 compared  1Q22 grew by 5.03% (year on year/yoy) whilst compared to  the previous quarter (4Q22) it contracted by 0.92% (quarter  on quarter/qoq).
For the second quarter (2Q23), Indonesia's  economy of 2Q22 grew 5.17% yoy, and of 1Q23 grew 3.86%  (qoq).
In the third quarter (3Q23), Indonesia's economy of  3Q22 grew 4.94% yoy, and 1.60% in 2Q23 (qoq).
com/news/20230807134424-4-460812 pabrik-nikel-menjamur-investasi-di-2023-tembus-rp39-triliun/ampDespite the political year in 2023, Indonesia's economic  growth remained stable and served as an important factor for  investments to continue to grow.
Based on the publication of  the Ministry of Investment/Investment Coordinating Board  (BKPM), investments realized in 2023 reached Rp1,418.9  trillion, exceeding 101.3% of the targeted Rp1,400 trillion.
Indonesia's economic growth can positively influence the  realization of the Company's business development plans  and sustainable mining operations.
Referring to the B20  priorities in ensuring a fair and orderly energy transition, PT  Vale seeks to strengthen its role in the global electrification  and decarbonization megatrends, and become a sustainable  nickel producer that pays attention to environmental, social  and governance (ESG) management.
At the end of 2023, the condition of the nickel industry  in Indonesia according to the Industrial Confidence Index  (IKI) shows a decline in nickel prices by 3.4%.
Nevertheless,  Indonesia still remains the largest nickel producing country,  proven by its nickel reserves, which account for 21% of the  world's nickel reserves and 48% of the world's nickel supply.
The government well embraced this condition by establishing  the downstreaming of the nickel industry and imposing a ban  on nickel ore exports since January 1, 2020 through Minister of  Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 11 of 2019.
The  development of electric vehicles in various countries is also  a positive opportunity for Indonesia.
Nickel downstreaming  in Indonesia is not only in the stainless steel sector, but also  aims to create a competitive ecosystem in the value chain of  lithium batteries and electric vehicles as well as increase the  value of nickel-derived exports.
The Indonesian government  also always ensures that the ongoing downstream upholds  ESG aspects.
The government through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources (ESDM) is targeting the construction of 32 new  nickel smelters to accelerate the downstream program.
A  total of 21 smelters have been built and most of them are  nickel smelters.
By 2023, the total number of operating nickel  smelters reached 116 units.
The realized investment in nickel  smelter construction in 2023 reached US$2,676.4 million.
Until 2023, PT Vale has never ceased to stress its commitment  to supporting nickel downstreaming in Indonesia.
This year,  the Company's nickel in matte production target is 70,725  metric tons (tons), an increase compared to the previous  year's production of 60,090 tons.
The Company has also  spent US$292,1 million in capital expenditure and US$29.7  million capital injection in 2023, including for projects in  Pomalaa and Morowali.
The Company is also working on  a smelter project in Sorowako, South Sulawesi, which is  expected to produce up to 60,000 tons of nickel per year.

The Company has long-term sales contracts with  Vale Canada Limited (VCL) and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.
(SMM) for products manufactured by the Company.
The entire process of nickel mining and processing takes  place in Indonesia with the scope of nickel ore mining  production, nickel in matte production, and nickel matte  sales.
Performance assessment of the mining operations  and nickel in matte production segment is carried out  based on the realized volume of nickel in matte production  during the financial year which is then compared with the  previous period.
During 2023, the total realized production of nickel in matte  was 70,728 tonnes, increasing by 10,638 tonnes or 18% higher  than the 2022 realization at 60,090 tonnes.
This increase was  due to the implementation of the Company's maintenance  strategy throughout the year.
In the fourth quarter, the  production realization showed the highest number of 19,084  tons while the first quarter showed the lowest number of  16,769 tons. 99 2023 Annual ReportGrafis Realisasi Produksi Nikel dalam Matte Tahun 2023 dan Perbandingan dengan Periode Sebelumnya (Ton) Graphic of Realization of Nickel in Matte Production in 2023 and Comparison with the Previous Period (Tons) Penjualan dan Pendapatan Segmen Usaha Penambangan dan  Pengolahan Nikel Nickel Mining and Processing Business Segment Sales and Revenue Penjualan yang dilakukan Perseroan menggunakan kontrak  penjualan “harus ambil” jangka panjang dalam mata  uang Dolar AS.
The Company's sales are made using long-term "must-take"  sales contracts denominated in US Dollars.
In determining  the selling price, the Company uses a cash-based formula  of nickel on the LME, and the cash price of cobalt on the  Fast Market.
Measurement of sales performance of the  nickel mining and processing business segment is based  on revenue of the fiscal year, from nickel matte sales to  VCL and SMM.
In addition, the Company also sets revenue  targets for the following year.
In 2023, the total sales volume of nickel matte was 71,108  tons, increasing by 10,148 tons or 17% compared to 2022  which amounted to 60,960 tons.
This increase occurred  due to the increase in the Company's production volume.
Until the end of 2023, PT Vale's revenue realization reached  US$1,232.26 million.
Compared to US$1,179.45 million realized  in 2022, this figure increased by US$52.81 million or 4.48%.
This rise was due to the increase in sales volume.
In 2023, the realization of Gross Profit from the nickel mining  and processing business segment amounted to US$347 .02  million, increasing by US$33.46 million, or 10.67%, compared  to US$313.57 million in 2022.

Some of the factors that affect the Company's business  activities in 2023 include the following: » Fluctuations in global nickel prices The level of demand and availability of supply, among the  reasons, may cause positive or negative sentiment towards  the price of nickel in the global market, which then affects  the Company's revenue.
The average LME nickel price has  decreased from US$26,142 per ton in 2022 to US$21,482 per  ton in 2023.
» Fuel price fluctuations The average price of High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) and coal  in 2023 was lower by 4.1% and 19.6% respectively compared  to 2022.
On the contrary, the average price of High Speed  Diesel (HSD) in 2023 was higher by 6.2% compared to 2022.
The Company could not control fuel, which was the largest  component of production costs, so the Company strove to  make efficient use of fuel.
» Government policies and changes in laws and  regulations The governance of the mineral and coal mining sector  through the enactment of new policies and regulations by  the Government may affect the Company's operations.
» Foreign exchange rate fluctuations The condition of the Company's operational areas in Indonesia  and the use of the Rupiah currency, which is affected by the  strengthening of the US dollar will impact the Company's  financial condition.
