This sub-chapter will provide a review of operations of Merdeka’s main assets which consist of:1 Tujuh Bukit Copper Project (“TB Copper Project”); 2) Wetar/Morowali AIM Project; 3) Pani Gold Project (“Pani Project”); 4) Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine; 5) Wetar Copper Mine.
TB Copper Project This project is located beneath the existing Tujuh Bukit Gold  Mine, and is 99.89% owned by Merdeka.
This project consists of the global Inferred Resource of 1.8 billion tonnes of ore at a grade  of 0.46% copper and 0.50 g/t gold containing approximately 8.2  million tonnes of copper and 28.6 million ounces of gold.
One of the achievements from 2021 include changes from the  previous resource include a new JORC classification (Indicated  Resource) incorporating updated geological and mineralisation  models, and drilling results from the underground exploration decline and surface.
The Indicated Resource contains 372 million  tonnes at 0.68 g/t gold and at 0.61% copper, with the Inferred  Resource containing 1.4 billion tonnes at 0.45 g/t gold and 0.42 % copper.
By year-end 2021, Merdeka invested US$99 million on a pre- feasibility study, with majority of the investment was related to  the underground development of an 1,890 meters exploration decline, resource definition drilling and geological model.
Given the exceptional drill results in 2021 and changes to the  overall geological model, additional mining optimizations are required for the completion of the pre-feasibility study to  support a higher Indicated Resource, the pre-feasibility study  is expected to be announced in Q1 2023.
AIM Project The ore at the Wetar Copper Mine is primarily pyrite (FeS2)  which hosts copper, gold, silver and zinc.
Since 2018, Merdeka has investigated opportunities to realize additional value from  the Wetar ore, as the existing heap leaching process at Wetar  only recovers a portion of the copper and does not recover any of the gold, silver, zinc, iron and sulphur (a component of  sulphuric acid) contained in the ore.
As part of this initiative,  Merdeka through its subsidiary, namely PT Batutua Pelita Investama (“BPI”) worked with Eternal Tsingshan Group  Limited through its affiliates, namely Wealthy Source Holding  Limited (“Tsingshan”) to conduct metallurgical test work on the Wetar ore as well as developing a preliminary process  flowsheet.
Tsingshan is involved in some projects that have  been and are being developed at the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (“IMIP”) located in Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Some  of these projects is projected to require large amounts of  sulphuric acid and steam in their production process.
Merdeka and Tsingshan along with their affiliates signed a  Joint Venture agreement for AIM Project under the name of  MTI in Q1 2021.
Merdeka through BPI owns 80% shareholding and Tsingshan through its affiliate owns 20% shareholding.
In March 2021, AIM Project has completed the feasibility study  with production capacity up to 1 million tonnes per annum  (mtpa).
Subsequently, AIM Project completed an investigation  to increase the plant capacity to 1.2 mtpa in the mid of 2021 with an estimated capital expenditure of US$387 million  including contingency.
AIM Project expected to deliver average  annual revenue and EBITDA over the first five years of US$280 million and US$160 million, respectively, with a compelling  Net Present Value (“NPV”) of US$513 million at 8% discount  rate with an Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) of 29.5%.
AIM Project has officially commenced the construction in Q2  2021, with first acid production scheduled at the end of Q1 2023.
Pani Project This gold mine project is located in Hulawa Village, Buntulia  District, Pohuwato Regency, Gorontalo Province.
Pani Project  is currently under development and is believed to have good prospects.
Merdeka Group acquired the Pani Project through  PT PBJ in November 2018 with an effective ownership of  66.7%, which holds the Mining Business License of Pani Project (“Pani IUP”) through PETS.
Moreover, Merdeka Group’s  partner in this project when such acquisition was conducted  is Lion Selection Asia Limited (“LSA”).
LSA is a subsidiary of Lion Selection Group Limited (“Lion”), an Australian Stock  Exchange listed company.
In December 2021, Merdeka signed a Conditional Share  Subscription Agreement with PT ABI and PT Provident  Indonesia to subscribe for the new shares to be issued by ABI in an amount sufficient to grant Merdeka share  ownership of 50.1% with a transaction value of US$80.16  million.
This acquisition has completed in March 2022.
Prior to the Transaction between Merdeka and Andalan, Andalan  has completed the acquisition of PT GSM from PT JRN, a  subsidiary of PSAB.
GSM holds the Contract of Work for Pani Project (“Pani CoW”).
The Pani IUP and Pani CoW mining properties are adjacent  to each other, and significant benefits are expected to be  delivered through a joint development of both properties to  develop into one larger gold project.
Following Merdeka’s investment in ABI, Merdeka owns majority  interest in the Pani Project through controlling interest in both PBJ (66.7%) and GSM (50.1%).
In March 2022, Merdeka has completed a Shares Transfer Deed  with LSA to purchase 50% of LSA’s interest in PBJ.
As a result  of this Transaction, Merdeka’s ownership in PBJ has increased  from 66.7% to 83.35%.
This transaction allows Merdeka to increase its economic interest in Pani Project from 60% to 70%.
As of December 31, 2021, the Pani Project through Pani IUP has  an estimated mineral resources of 89.5 million tonnes at 0.82  g/t gold containing 2.37 million ounces of gold.
On top of that,  through Pani CoW, the Pani Project has an estimated mineral resources of 72.7 million tonnes at 0.98 g/t gold containing  2.30 million ounces of gold.
The area between the Pani IUP and Pani CoW (“Baganite  Zone”) has had two holes drilled by Utah International in 1982,  which assayed 406m @ 0.5 g/t (GPD-04) and 154m @ 0.57g/t (GPD-05).
Reserves for both projects would have been constrained by the  need to maintain pit walls within the respective tenements.
By combining the projects into one, larger gold mine project,  the overall reserves are likely to be materially larger than the expected reserves would have been if the projects were  developed separately.
Combining both projects optimises  the development of the combined resources.
One combined project will provide significant economies of scale with ore  processed through one larger process plant.
Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine  The Tujuh Bukit Gold Mine is located about 60 km southwest of  the central government of Banyuwangi Regency or about 205  km southeast of Surabaya, the capital of East Java Province.
In 2021, commercial production of this project reached 124,730  ounces of gold.
Current resources contain 82.1 million tonnes of ore at 0.44 g/t  gold, containing 1.1 million ounces of gold.
Wetar Copper MineMerdeka Group owns the Wetar Copper Mine through ownership in BTR and BKP .
The mining of copper is carried out  by BKP while processing and refining is carried out by BTR as  the holder of a Production Operation Mining Business License (“IUP OPK”) specifically for Processing and Refining of Copper  Metal Mineral.
In May 2021, Merdeka Group has owned 100% of the Wetar  Copper Mine, following the completion of acquisition of 22%  interest in BTR from Posco International Corporation.
BTR is also the owner of 70% of BKP , with the remaining 30% of BKP  directly owned by Merdeka.
In 2021, Wetar Copper Mine produced 19,045 tonnes of  copper cathode, representing a significant increase by 254.2%  compared to 5,377 tonnes copper production in prior year.
Cash cost per pound and AISC cost per pound stood at  US$1.76 and US$2.33, respectively.
