| MAP ANNUAL REPORT 2020086REVIEW  — In 2020, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic shows an overall economic downturn.
Government policies to break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 virus, including quarantine or  Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) since mid-March 2020, have contributed to worsening economic conditions in Indonesia.
The condition of malls in Indonesia, which are not operating normally, also has an impact on the decline in the Company’s net revenue.
In 2020, there are three new Financial Accounting Standards implemented by the Company, namely PSAK  71 concerning Financial Instruments, PSAK 72 relating to Revenue from Contracts with Customers and PSAK 73 relating to Leases.
From the application of the three PSAKs, PSAK 73 has the most impact on the Company, both in terms of  total assets, total liabilities or profit or loss.
Broadly speaking, PSAK 73 introduces significant changes to the accounting for tenants by eliminating the difference between operating and financing leases, requiring the recognition of rights-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the inception date for leases, except for short-term leases and leases where the underlying assets are low value.
The impact of this new PSAK resulted in the Company having several new accounts, namely rights-of-use  assets and Lease Liabilities.
The company’s prepaid rent, which mainly originated from prepaid rental fees, decreased significantly.
In the Profit and Loss Statement, rental expenses have decreased while there is an increase in depreciation expense for the rights-of-use assets and also lease expenses related to lease liabilities.
As explained above, the Covid-19 pandemic caused the Company and its subsidiaries' net revenue to  decline by 31.4% to Rp14.8 trillion versus FY19.
The gross profit and operating profit also decreased by 40.1% and 102.9%, respectively.
And in line with that, EBITDA and net income were also down by 20.9% and 150.3%, respectively.
The specialty stores segment remained the main contributor to the Company’s net revenue, contributing  71.3%, followed by the Food & Beverage at 13.8%, while Department Stores, and Manufacturing, Book Stores and others Businesses contributed 12.7% and 2.2%, respectively.
The Specialty Stores segment is a positive contributor to the Company’s operating profit compared to  Department Stores, Food & Beverage segment, as well as from Manufacturing, Book Stores and Others.
In 2020, the Company through its subsidiary (MAA) expanded overseas, by establishing MAPH (Map Active  Philipine Inc.
) and acquiring PSIPH (Planet Sport, Inc.
) located in the Philippines.
For domestic expansion, the Company launched new brands such as Amore Pacific Group: Innisfree and  Laneige.

COMPARISON BETWEEN RESULTS AND TARGETS FOR PERIOD OF 2020 AND PROJECTIONS FOR 2021 In 2020, some of our key performance indicators were achieved below targets, including our Gross Profit Margin which fell to 41.6% and higher inventory level compared to previous years.
This temporary weakening results were due to social restrictions that forced temporary mall closures in Q2, adjustments in businesses’ operational hours including malls and restaurants, and as a result of our effort to avoid built-up inventory during unprecedented times.
However, with easing of social distancing measures and signs of gradual recovery across the overall economics, we are well positioned to build on MAP’s unique strengths and capabilities to drive long-term sustainable growth with the power of our Unified Retail Strategy, centered around our loyalty program, MAPClub.
