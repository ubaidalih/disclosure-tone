MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK242 ECONOMIC REVIEW Global Economy Analysis With 2021 coming into view, global economy made its gradual recovery from the recess caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The virus itself has not yet disappeared as it continued to mutate and circulate.
However, social restriction policies have been toned down.
Access to various sectors has also been opened but with health protocols in mind as well as acceleration and distribution of vaccines as a mitigation effort to anticipate the spread and the adverse effects of the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) established that at least 40% of world population would be vaccinated by the end of 2021 and 70% by the middle of 2022 to achieve herd immunity.
Close to the end of 2021, rich nations that already achieved vaccination targets such as England and Singapore announced decisions to remove health coverage for those contracting COVID-19, to change the status of pandemic to endemic, and to treat COVID-19 as a common flu.
The International Monetary Fund  (IMF) in its report called World Economic Outlook in October 2021, projected the global economy in 2021 would grow by 5.9%.
This projection was the result of 0.1% reduction from the previous report in July 2021, following a massive bottleneck in global supply chain and potential energy shortage amidst pressure to accelerate the application of green economy and finance.
Overview 2021  Throughout the uncertainty-ridden period that was 2021, Bank Mandiri could still record good profit and grow positively owing to its ability to manage asset quality.
Bank Mandiri always monitored the developments of various macroeconomic indicators and the latest pandemic situation so that business strategies could be executed optimally to reflect the best performance.
As the global and national economy slowly recovered  from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bank Mandiri not only succeeded in reverting to its pre-pandemic performance, but also surpassing it.
This was apparent in the consistent growth of business volume that showed that the consolidated loans grew by 8.86% YoY to reach Rp1,050.2 trillion, along with a consistent improvement in credit quality and adequacy of allowance for impairment losses.
From the perspective of Third-Party Funds (consolidated), its growth increased by 12.08% YoY to reach Rp1,291.2 trillion.
Profitability also showed a promosing growth, where at the consolidated level, net profit and net interest income each went up to Rp28.03 trillion and Rp74.84 trillion compared to the same period in 2020 which were Rp16.80 trillion and Rp64.03 trillion.
The achievement of both indicators had exceeded the 2021 Corporate Work Plan and Budget (RKAP) of Rp19.47 trillion for net profit and Rp70.72 trillion for net interest income.
MACRO OVERVIEW 2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION243UN data revealed unemployment  due to pandemic exceeded 200 million people.
After economic recovery, there were still several mobility restrictions in many important trading routes and locations such as the Suez Canal, the Pearl River in China, and Los Angeles and Long Beach in the United States (US).
Cross-border travels were difficult due to unavailability of global vaccine permit.
Meanwhile, demands grew after a long period of obsolescence.
However, producers were not entirely ready to fully operate.
There were issues in shipping.
The global supply chain problem raised a concern about inflation.
The projected inflation in Europe in 2021 was 4.2%, or twice than the previous year.
in Asia, the average regional inflation was 2.1%, lower than the 2.5% in 2020.
Nevertheless, the inflation rate in Asia’s most developed nations was 1.0%, which was higher than previous year’s 0.2%.
The average inflation in this region’s developing nations was 2.3%, driven by India’s 5.6% inflation.
During the same period, the IMF predicted the US would grow by 6% following previous year’s contraction of 3.4%.
Germany had the least projected growth, 3.1%, while England, now in a new era after Brexit, was projected to grow the highest in Europe, with 6.8% rate.
In Asia, India was projected to grow the fastest at 9.5%, beating China’s projected growth of 8%.
Singapore followed, at 6%, and then came Vietnam at 3.8%, Malaysia at 3.5%, Indonesia and the Philippines at 3.2% each, and Thailand at 1%.

Meanwhile, world crude oil price of WTI (West Texas Intermediate) for January 2022 delivery is at US$75 per barrel, up 56% compared to US$48 at the end of 2020.
The increased price of this “black gold” was driven by decreased demand.
The US oil reserves was reported to plummet below five-year average.
Near the end of 2021, OPEC members agreed to release oil reserves to the market to reduce price.
Palm oil price in the spot market increased to US$1,187 per ton compared to previous year’s US$1,020.
Rubber price also went up to US$1.92 per kilogram (kg) from previous year’s US$1.58 per kg.
MACRO OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK244 In the financial sector, the IMF  considered that the global financial stability risks remained normal due to the continuous implementation of fiscal and monetary policies.
Despite that, the IMF reminded of vulnerabilities that might arise from long-term implementation of financial relaxation through which asset valuation could turn loose.
Regarding the ecosystem of cryptocurrency, although its risks do not appear to be systemic, policymakers need to apply a global standard to cryptocurrency assets and improve monitoring by closing the gaps in data.

National Economy Analysis According to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Indonesian economy until the third quarter of 2021 grew by 31.5% year on year (yoy), lower than the government’s projection of 4.5%.

The IMF projected the Indonesian economic growth in 2021 would be 3.2%.
In the real economy, manufacturing and domestic service sectors grew with Purchasing Manager’s Index at 57.2 as of October 2021, higher than the 47.2 of the same period last year.

com BPS mentioned all the expenditure  components grew slower during extra social restrictions in the middle of 2021.
The restrained mobility during that period caused a decline in domestic demand.
Household consumption slightly increased by 1.03%, gross net capital investment by 3.74%, government expenditure by 0.66%, export by 29.16%, and import by 30.11%.
Meanwhile, current year’s inflation was at 1.66% as of October 2021.

Rupiah had appreciated to Rp13,899 on January 7, 2021, and depreciated to Rp14,634 on April 14, 2021.
To encourage national economic recovery and sustain public purchasing power, BI extended the credit relaxation for vehicles of 0% until the end of year.
Similar relaxation was also applied to financing of all kinds of properties with a loan to financing ratio of 100%.
In this regard, BI also maintained the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate at 3.50%, a savings rate of 2.75%, and a loan rate of 4.25%.

Economic Projections for 2022  The IMF projected global economic growth for 2022 at 4.9%, lower than the projection in 2021 which was 5.9%.
For developed nations, growth in 2022 is projected to be at 4.5% compared to 5.2% in 2021.
For developing nations, the projected average growth is 5.1% compared to 6.4% in 2021.
The IMF also projected a 5.2% growth in 2022 for Asian countries, which is lower than the projection for 2021 at 6.5%.
Developed nations in this region are projected to grow by 3.4% while developing nations by 6.3% on average.
India is projected to continue its role as a prime mover for growth with a 8.5% growth in 2022, after in 2021 it was projected to grow by 9.5%.
Regarding the Indonesian economy in 2022, it is projected to grow by 5.9%, but according to the Bank of Indonesia, the growth will be around 4.7%-5.5%.
Generally, there will be different rates of growth among developed nations and developing nations, where developed nations recover and grow faster than developing nations.
In terms of fiscal policies, BI  reasoned that all countries would be doing fiscal normalization as the deficit would continue to drop since 2021.
Deficit in developed nations is projected to be 3.6% in 2023 while in developing nations it is 4.8% in 2024.
Regarding leverage, BI predicted  the number of failing performances by corporations would rival the that of the global economic crisis, where the US would be followed by Europe and developing nations.
For that matter, the central bank needs to examine carefully the cracks in corporations so that the risks will not escalate and harm the MACRO OVERVIEW banking business individually and the financial stability.
Normalization of the arrangements for credit relaxation will have to be cautiously executed.
With good financial stability,  sufficient capital and liquidity, BI predicted DPK would grow by 7%-9% and credit by 6%-8% in 2022.
Aside from it, BI gave the green light to minimize liquidity gradually and proportionally but with enough room for leniency.
BI also gave permission to review the policy rate in the second half of 2022.

The concern for this matter gets bigger with a targeted carbon emission reduction of 8%-9%.
The government need to establish a program to control carbon emission to uphold the Paris Agreement.
This program will entail incentives that will be given by the government and the central bank for the development of environmentally friendly financial projects and products such as tax incentives, carbon taxes, or macroprudential policies that offer benefits to green financing.

In the spirit of Making the Nation Prosperous, Bank Mandiri has the following vision and mission:1) Vision: “To be your preferred financial partner”.2) Mission: Providing Reliable, Simple Digital Banking Solutions, and Becoming Part of Customer Life (“Seamlessly integrate our financial products & services into our customers’ lives by delivering simple, fast digital banking solutions”).
The three main targets of the 2020-2024 Corporate Plan 2020-2024 are:1.
Be the Preeminent Wholesale Bank, beyond lending namely by leveraging the strength of Bank Mandiri as a wholesale bank to go beyond lending, by acquiring new potential sources of income from customers through:  • Provision of beyond lending solutions such as structured finance and trade and advisory solutions in collaboration with Bank Mandiri’s subsidiaries, namely Mandiri Sekuritas and Overseas Offices.
• Improvement of transaction banking, including cash management, forex, and trade   • Fokus on the penetration of anchor clients and selective sectors • Enhancement of the capabilities of the Relationship Manager (RM) to make them a financial advisor for Bank Mandiri customers • Enhancement of the capability of the Wholesale Digital Super Platform KOPRA by Mandiri2.
Promote sustainable SME & Micro Growth through:  • Enhancement of SME networks by improving the capabilities of the Sales Team and supporting tools • Improvement to the effectiveness of data analytics through an Early Warning System (EWS) •  Streamlining of  business processes and improvement to value chain processes as well as reliance on technology to accelerate acquisition and credit analysis • Enhancement of the capabilities of branch offices through one-stop solutions for customers • Coaching of micro customers to level up • Improvement to micro credit processes • Partnership expansion with Fintech and reliance on branchless banking agents 3.
Become the Best Modern Digital Bank, through:  • Domination in the digital banking market with a focus on the salaried-employee segment • Increasing payroll customer penetration and CASA Retail growth through digital channels • Development of a financial superstore app that could serve the needs of Bank Mandiri customers • Strengthening of partnerships with various e-commerce in Indonesia MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK252 • Development of  Bank Mandiri digital applications integrated into the bank-end core system • Enhancement of the digital retail bank capabilities • Acceleration of transaction migration to digital channels and optimization of branches Bank Mandiri also prepares enablers or other bank-wide strategic support to support the achievement of business targets and main aspirations, including through: 1.
Increasing the capability of  digital banking services, both back-end and front-end to increase efficiency as indicated by a decrease in the efficiency level of the ratio 2.
Alignment of risk management to balance growth and quality 3.
Development of Human Resources capabilities to support strategy achievement 4.
Enhancing the capabilities of Special Asset Management In implementing the 2020-2024 Corporate Plan, it is necessary to strengthen Bank Mandiri’s 2020-2024 Corporate Plan through 3 (three) main strengths, namely: 1.
Integration of Wholesale and  Retail Businesses by maximizing the value chain potential in the Wholesale customer ecosystem (Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Segment)2.
Growing and optimizing business potentials in the regions and sectors in Indonesia as well as sectors that recover faster and increasing total collaboration between the Wholesale and Retail Segments and the Subsidiaries. 3.
Continuing digital acceleration through the development of digital solutions, process improvements, channel modernization, and enhancement of core banking capabilities to support customer banking activities in a faster and more reliable manner.
Short-Term Strategies for 2021-2022Bank Mandiri is currently on track to achieve the 2024 aspirations, in that the Bank aims to become a preeminent wholesale bank beyond lending, have SME and micro businesses that grow healthily and become the first modern Digital Retail Bank in Indonesia.
For 2022, Bank Mandiri holds an optimistic view that economic recovery will accelerate.
Relaxation initiated by regulators concerning credit assessment and credit restructuring will help the bank control its NPL ratio.
In addition, another opportunity  that Bank can seize is the increasing number of transactions through electronic banking channel that makes it possible for the Bank to acquire a new customer segment and optimize operations more efficiently.
In December 2021, Bank Indonesia recorded 60.25% annual digital transaction in the financial sector with a transaction value of Rp3.4 trillion.
To capture this opportunity, Bank Mandiri would keep optimizing its digital ecosystem including super app Livin’ by Mandiri and Kopra, formulating Digital Lending and Funding products, and cooperating with key ecosystem players.
The year 2022 will also be a  challenging year for the banking industry.
The gap in global economic recovery between nations and the normalization plan revealed by the Fed leads to tapering that potentially causes an increase in policy rate in the future.
This issue of tapering will also be responded by Bank Indonesia (BI) by increasing BI rate, which will affect the credit rate and hamper TPF growth.
Strict financing is also projected to be affected by digital banks offering deposit rate that is above the market rate in an attempt to expand their customer bases.
This will of course lead conventional banks to raise their interest rates to be able to compete.
Even so, cautiousness is still needed  to face various external and internal challenges.
Economic recovery is still very much dependent on the execution and effectiveness of vaccination to fight the pandemic.
Government stimuli and economic policy support are of equal importance also.
The budgeting of the National Economic Recovery  BUSINESS STRATEGIES 2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION253(NER) program is expected to help  accelerate economic recovery.
For 2022, the Government allocates a budget up to Rp414 trillion for the NER program that targets the health sector, public protection, and economic strengthening and recovery.
Meanwhile, economic normalization post-pandemic potentially causes risks such as inflation and credit risk after relaxation and restructuring period is over.
In the implementation, Bank Mandiri  maximizes the potential within the value chain of the Wholesale customer ecosystem (Corporate, Commercial, and Institutional segments) and optimizes business potential in the region and in sectors with a faster recovery rate by intensifying collaboration between the Wholesale and Retail segments and the Subsidiaries.
Bank Mandiri also continues digital acceleration through the development of digital solutions, process improvements, channel modernization, and enhancement of core banking capabilities to support customer banking activities in a faster and more reliable manner.
Eight Prioritized Strategies The focus of Bank Mandiri in 2022 can be seen in the strategic management goals prepared by the management to achieve the Bank’s vision, which is to be the customer’s preferred financial partner.
The strategic goals are as follows: 1.
Highlighting the role of technology in the Wholesale  and Retail segments 2.
Increasing NIM with a focus on CASA growth in the Retail segment 3.
Enhancing the branch model to make it relevant with business potential and technological trends 4.
Transforming operations both for digital and physical channels 5.

Preparing Human Capital to anticipate digitization and business growth of Bank Mandiri Risk Management RoleRisk management is performed in an integrated manner, connecting strategic planning, risk appetite, execution, risk assessment, and performance evaluation to maximize shareholder value.
The Bank’s risk management is regulated by a risk management policy established according to Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI), Financial Services Authority Regulation (FSA Regulation), Basel provisions and international best practices.
This policy is reviewed periodically to anticipate changes in business conditions, regulations, and the Bank’s internal conditions.
Risk management is carried out for every activity of the Bank and serves to drive business growth prudently.
Risk management is needed to account for the types, scope, and rapid growth of business as well as for the increasingly complex risks prevalent in the Bank’s activities.
The implementation of risk management also serves to anticipate the impact of global economic recession, slowdown of domestic economic growth, and fluctuations in macroeconomic and market indicators.
CONTROL OF NON- PERFORMING LOANS Bank Mandiri’s credit quality  kept improving in 2021.
By the fourth quarter of 2021, credit quality showed improvement after having been restrained during the pandemic in 2020.
The non-performing loans/NPL gross ratio continued to get better incrementally, which was good news.
The same trend is seen in the amount of restructured credit due to the pandemic.
This made credit risk conditions better, in addition to a decrease in loan fees.
By the fourth quarter of 2021, Bank  Mandiri recorded a restructured credit amount of Rp69.7 trillion (bank only), lower compared to the end of 2020 of Rp93.3 trillion.
More specifically, 52.8% of the restructured credit had low risk, BUSINESS STRATEGIES MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK254 33.1% of it had medium risk, and  14.1% had high risk.
While, Bank Mandiri gross NPL stood at 2.81% in December 2021, down from the end-of-year position of 3.29% in 2020.
Bank Mandiri will continue to monitor tightly the re-structured credit due to the pandemic.

On the other hand, the cost of credit  as of December 2021 was 1.91% (bank only), while the consolidated cost of credit was 2.13%.
Both were as expected, that is, both were within the management guiding range of 1.9%-2.4%.
This ratio was under control and continued to go down per quarter compared to the end-of-2020 position of 2.35%.
With better conditions by  December 2021, Bank Mandiri posted credit growth of bank only and consolidated in 2021 at 8.45% YoY and 8.86% YoY, respectively.
However, Bank Mandiri will continue to implement prudent and selective banking for lending by choosing sectors per the guidelines, namely those that have a faster recovery rate from crises due to the pandemic.
Bank Mandiri also fosters quality growth in the Wholesale and Retail segments.
To help maintain the net interest margin, the Bank remains focused on high-yield segments, and at the same time suppresses fund fees by downgrading debt to income ratio and main-taining low cost funds ratio at a high rate.
According to the performance guidelines for 2021,  the net interest margin was between  5.09% consolidated.
A strong CASA ratio of 69.70% compared to 65.63% in the previous year, thereby able to sustain the credit to de-posit ratio.
To improve credit quality, Bank  Mandiri has taken several measures as follows: assessing credit accounts belonging to the collectability 1 and 2 to be included in the watch list; making efforts to save the credit of debtors in the watchlist through an acceleration of credit restructuring of debtors who show good faith, business prospects, and financial conditions that got better, as well as collateral with adequate security coverage ratio.
For non-performing debtors, Bank Mandiri will make debt rescheduling, reconditioning, and restructuring including, among others, the conversion of credit to temporary equity participation.
For debtors who have undergone restructuring, Bank Mandiri continues to monitor their financial conditions through business prospect assessment, supervision of the debtors’ market conditions and economic conditions, and monitoring of other factors affecting the performance and the  repayment capacity of the debtors.
For loans credit restructuring was not viable, the Bank will downsize the debit tray immediately.
In addition, Bank Mandiri improves coordination and cooperation with such stakeholders as PPATK, Private Auction Hall, judiciary, and curator in managing non-performing loans.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES 2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION255STRATEGY TO INCREASE FEE- BASED INCOME IN 2022 Bank Mandiri individually recorded  a fee-based income of Rp25.24 trillion in December 2021.

Also, the Bank drove commercial paper transactions of customers through a network of priority branch offices that targeted priority customers and private banking requiring investment alternatives to funds.
In an effort to provide alternate solutions to customers, Bank Mandiri’s Treasury Bank had developed structured products aimed at improving returns and hedging.
This product garnered positive responses from the Wholesale Banking and the Retail Banking.
Bank Mandiri’s Treasury also continued to innovate to improve its service for customers through a digital platform, Kopra.
To promote equal contributions, the Bank strengthened the function of Regional Treasury Marketing (RTM) in every region.
RESPONSE TO THE  CHANGING MONETARY POLICIES The monetary policies throughout  2021 were accompanied by monetary stimuli designed to accelerate economic recovery following a recess caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Bank of Indonesia (BI) asserted that business players needed various monetary stimuli to fully recover.
During recovery, the interest rate was kept low.
Throughout the year, the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR) was down by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.50% from 3.75% in 2020.
In addition, the deposit interest rate was set at 2.75% and the loan interest rate at 4.25%.
This decision was consistent with market expectations and the need for stabilizing foreign exchange rates and the financial system amidst an expected low inflation rate.
BI also continues to implement monetary policies that are accommodating to help economic recovery.
The low interest rate due to  monetary policies and unrestricted liquidity drove the banking credit rate down.
In the money market and funds market, the overnight Interbank Money Market Rate and the one-month deposit interest rate went down by 52 bps and 151 bps respectively since October 2020 to 2.80% and 3.17% in October 2021.
In the credit market, the declining Prime Lending Rate (PLR) continued to go down, followed by a new credit rate.
Recovering economic activities and public mobility after Social Restriction (PPKM) also improved banking risk perception which positively affected the decrease in the new credit rate.
In response to BI policy that cut the policy rate, Bank Mandiri cut its Rupiah base credit rate.
As of September 2021, the base credit rate for Wholesale was 8.00%, for Retail 8.25%, for micro 11.25%, for consumption-housing 7.25%, and for consumption – non-housing 8.75%.

Interest rates will be kept low until there is an indication of inflation.
BI also aims to cut back on liquidity gradually by continuing to purchase Government Bonds (SBN) in the primary market and secondary market.
Then, BI will coordinate closely with the finance minister to keep Rupiah stable under market fundamentals and mechanisms, and to mitigate the effects of monetary normalization done by the US Central Bank through forex intervention and positioning of SBN against the US bonds to make it more attractive to investors.
BI ensures that lenient  macroprudential policies will hold in 2022 to boost banking credit in prioritized sectors.
Further, through synergy with the Financial Sector Policy Committee (FSPC), BI will develop long-term financing instruments, especially green financing, and will develop MSMEs and Sharia economy as a commitment to inclusive economy and finance.
As such, there is a need for the development of halal economy, specifically concerning food, fashion, money market instruments, sukuk of BI, and Sharia finance festivals in three areas at an international level.
Regarding the payment system,  BI aims to enhance digitization to accelerate the realization of digital national economy and finance.
Support is also given to consolidate payment systems in industries by building an end-to-end ecosystem that accommodates digital banking, fintech, and e-commerce.
BUSINESS PROSPECTS Economic conditions are projected to improve and recover from the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which increases Bank Mandiri’s optimism about its business direction.
The government’s good efforts to handle the COVID-19 pandemic are seen in the rising participation in vaccination, which is expected to loosen public restrictions so that economic activities can continue and drive national economic growth.
However, there is a risk and challenges in 2022 that merit caution, such as the emergence of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19, disruptions in global supply chains, inflation, and the risk of declining credit quality caused by debtors’ insufficient ability to pay debts.
This high uncertainty drives the banking industry to strengthen their capital and maintain asset quality.
As the trust from business players improved, Bank Indonesia projected that the banking loans disbursement in Indonesia in 2022 would grow by 6-8%, while TPF would grow by 7-9%.
Bank Mandiri is optimistic about achieving the projected growth rates because it achieved good performance in 2021.
Bank Mandiri believes that business continuity is reliant on appropriate business strategies.

The increasing credit distribution was supported by sectors having recovered earlier from the recess and other sectors not impacted by the implementation of public activity restrictions.
By December 2021, Bank Mandiri  (bank only) successfully recorded a net profit of Rp25.4 trillion or a 79.51% growth YoY.
The main components of the net profit growth were net interest income that grew by 15.28% YoY, reaching Rp54.0 trillion and interest expenses that decrease by 30.42% YoY as well as a NPL Ratio at 2.81% which maintained asset quality.
The improvement in the Bank’s profitability brought an increase of 602bps or 14.31% in ROE after tax and ROA before tax increased by 89 bps YoY or 2.53%.
On operational performance by  segment, the wholesale segment managed to record good loans.
Corporate Banking grew by 7.82% YoY to reach Rp333.8 trillion, Commercial Banking grew by 11.02% YoY to reach Rp173.8 trillion, and Institutional Relations grew by 20.93% YoY to reach Rp29.7 trillion.
From the retail segment, SME Banking loans grew by 8.13% YoY to reach Rp60.2 trillion, micro segment grew by 9.30% YoY to reach Rp131.9 trillion, consumer loan segment grew by 5.83% YoY to reach Rp79.9 trillion.

Although the performance of Bank  Mandiri showed acceleration, in the future the challenges will be bigger.
In line with the post-pandemic normalization period, the pressure to recover will be heavier, which may cause, among other things, restrained banking liquidity and increasing competition in the finance industry that promises more efficient and convenient financial services.
Besides, challenges may arise due to the ending of commodity super cycle which makes commodity prices flat although still above the profit margins required by businesses, different rates of economic recovery globally, and a porential increase in the policy rate in the future.
However, in every challenge lies  an opportunity to exploit in 2022.
For example, global economy is predicted to rebound gradually in 2022, resting on the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic will be better handled.
Governments from around the world are likely to focus more on improving policies on health and economy and expanding job opportunities as well as supporting small businesses.
In Indonesia, national economic  recovery continues on the back of the nation’s successful handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The national economic growth in 2022 is predicted to get better due to increasing mobility, acceleration of the COVID-19 vaccination programs, strong export, opening of more priority sectors, and continuous implementation of stimulating policies.  2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION263DIGITAL BANKING ACHIEVEMENT HIGHLIGHTS  In its efforts to become a digital bank organically, Bank Mandiri launches a single access digital service  for the Wholesale Segment called Kopra, as well as polishes digital services for Retail customers: New Livin’.

In fact, this desire has been stated in the 2020-2024 Company Plan, through a digital transformation strategy known as the four-pronged framework.
This transition to digital strategy is scheduled to last for five years in stages, starting from digitizing internal platforms, developing digital products, modernizing channels, to providing banking services to the company’s external digital platforms.
Unexpectedly, the COVID-19  pandemic that broke out in 2020 forced the world’s citizens to limit physical social interaction to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In such conditions, digital innovation developed in various lines of people’s lives.
Financial technology (fintech) companies engaged in payment gateways, digital wallets, wealth management, social crowdfunding, even those engaged in lending and borrowing thrived in the country.
New digital banks appeared, existing banks were also competing to offer digital solutions.
This increased competition has moved Bank Mandiri to accelerate its steps to become a digital bank.

Bank Mandiri also distributed KSM (a payroll loan for fulfilling multipurpose needs) debit balance reached Rp65.37 trillion at the end of 2021 or declined by 0.79% from the 2020 debit balance which reached Rp65.89 trillion.
The focus of the target market  for KSM distribution in 2021 was the government sector (civil servant, army/police, and state-based enterprise employee) which relatively had low risk as the volume driver, while the private employment sector was developed selectively as a revenue-driver.
In managing the target market,  the KSM acquisition strategy was adjusted to each regional potential, with an acquisition focus on employees within the ecosystem of wholesale value chain customers and under a collaboration with subsidiary entities.
The approach was taken to  encourage healthy and prospective growth of Bank Mandiri’s MML portfolio, which was reflected in the percentage of the NPL that was kept low at 1.21% by the end of 2021.
In 2021, the distribution of KSM  began to utilize digital means (Livin’ by Mandiri) to enable a cheaper, faster, and closer process of credit acquisition, as Bank Mandiri committed to improving its service quality to the customers.

This was attributable to the government’s role, such as being proactive in reviving the national property market by providing a stimulus, both for developers and potential house owners.
Through the Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) Number 21 of 2021, as of March 2021, the Government provided 100% subsidy of Value Added Tax (VAT) for landed houses and flats with a maximum selling price of Rp2 billion, as well as 50% VAT subsidy for units with selling prices of Rp2 billion to Rp5 billion.
The incentives were valid until August 2021 and extended until December 2021 through PMK Number 103/PMK.010/21.
Other incentives included Bank  Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number 23/2/PBI/2021 concerning the Third Amendment to PBI Number 20/8/PBI/2018 dated 1 March 2021 concerning Loan to Value Ratio for Property Loans, Financing to Value Ratio for Property Financing, and Advances for Credit or Motor Vehicle Financing.
The policy is essentially a relaxation of down payment terms to help increase public access to Mandiri KPR acquisitions, especially KPR facilities with an LTV rate of 95%-100%.
These stimulus policies, issued by  the Government and the regulator, helped increase the acquisition of Mandiri KPR.
As of December 2021, Mandiri’s KPR portfolio grew by 6.15% on an annual basis to Rp46.22 trillion.
Similar to the property sector, the  Government and the regulator also afforded relaxation and stimulus policies for the automotive sector.
The issuance of the Sales Tax on Luxury Goods (PPnBM) incentive program by the Government in March 2021 boosted automotive sales in Indonesia significantly.
The positive trend impacted to the growth of Bank Mandiri Auto Loans portfolio to Rp31.33 trillion in December 2021, rose by 5.03% annually compared to the previous year.
In line with the program, Bank  Indonesia Regulation Number 23/2/PBI/2021 also regulates motor vehicles financing.
For the auto loan, the financing of the LTV segment of up to 100% also increased particularly from employees who are the target market for this product, which was adjusted by the risk appetite of each bank or financing institution.
This 100% LTV segment, especially one that targeted employees in December 2021, retained a relaxation of LTV > 85%, which increased by 5 times compared to the previous month and also became the highest booking for new car acquisitions with LTV > 85% since the implementation of LTV relaxation by Bank Indonesia in March 2021.
Regarding ease of access, Bank  Mandiri developed the capability of Mandiri KPR’s digital application services in collaboration with marketplaces and brokerage companies.
Meanwhile, digital access development for Bank Mandiri Auto Loans started earlier in collaboration with subsidiary.

The generation of fee-based income in this segment for 2021 reached Rp277.45 billion, grew by 27.93% or Rp60.57 billion compared to Rp216.88 billion in 2020.
In 2021, there was an increase  in AUM and fee-based income sourced from conventional mutual funds.
Despite that, there was a decline in AUM and fee-based income from the Protected Mutual Funds.
The decline was caused by the fact that several Protected Mutual Funds matured in 2021 but were not replaced by new Protected Mutual Funds.
The low number of issued Protected Mutual Funds in 2021 was caused by the minimum supply of corporate bonds as the underlying assets of Protected Mutual Funds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The increases in AUM were quite  high in fixed income mutual funds and stock mutual funds as they were influenced by the downward trend of market interest rate, which made the customers rebalance their portfolios into such asset classes.
In addition, several fixed income mutual funds offered regular dividend payments, which were favored by the customers as they were similar to the Protected Mutual Funds.
Such AUM increases also drove the increase of fee-based income from conventional mutual funds, particularly in the asset classes of fixed income mutual funds and stock mutual funds.
Securities and Retail Treasury  ProductsSecurities are traded in Priority Branches and Regular Branches of Bank Mandiri at competitive rates and require little transaction nominal.
The revenue generated from providing these services can be seen from the volume of transactions and the sales revenue from the sale of securities and retail treasury products.

In the context of fee-based income, the referral services have successfully generated revenue of Rp5.48 billion in 2021, which consisted of transactions in the primary market and secondary market.
Secondary Market Government  Securities and Foreign Exchange and Structured Product TransactionsThe bond market in 2021 was relatively rife with challenges as the potential of rebalancing transactions tended to decline due to a downward trend of bond rate from the yield bonds that were continuously increasing.
However, in 2021, the transaction volume growth of Secondary Market Government Securities increased significantly by 39.03% and reached Rp28.57 trillion.
Such growth and the FBI of Secondary Market Government Securities might be consistently improved using New Investor (NTI) growth strategy that still had great potential and was supported by RM sales skills that became capable of driving transaction growth.
The transaction volume growth of foreign exchange (forex) and structured products was supported by the optimization of forex and structured product transactions, as well as the changes from performance recognition strategy to sales, which led to significant growth in transaction volume in 2021.
However, such growth did not reflect the revenue generated in 2021 as the margin from forex/structured product transactions was low.
In 2021, the Secondary Securities  transactions grew by 32.67% to reach Rp27.26 trillion, which was driven by market conditions and increasing market penetration that led to FBI contribution of Rp251.38 billion or 16.87% growth.
Forex transaction volume also grew significantly by 27.4% to reach US%18.24 billion but the FBI decreased by 32.0% to Rp398.95 billion due to meager average revaluation spread in 2020 and lower market volatility in 2021 compared to previous year’s.
RETAIL BANKINGRETAIL BANKING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK312 BUSINESS OUTLOOK OF  RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT IN 2022 The year 2022 packs hopefulness  for the retail banking sector as the COVID-19 cases in Indonesia began to show a downward trend and the government plan to provide booster vaccines may increase confidence in the economic sector which in turn increases public spending, a key factor of the retail banking segment.
Healthy growth remains the main focus of this sector, which is achievable by suitable target market selection, strong digital presence, and reliable business processes.
WORK PLAN OF RETAIL  BANKING SEGMENT FOR 2022 In 2022, managing the derivative  value chain business for wholesale customers and strengthening the digital business processes become the main strategy of the Retail Banking segment.

The collaboration pattern of the derivative value chain of wholesale customers will be intensified in 2022.

The payroll-based segment  remains the key target market for the consumptive credit business of the Retail Banking segment in 2022.
As a leading bank in the wholesale segment, Bank Mandiri also continues to explore the potential of payroll-based business from its Wholesale anchor clients.
Digital channels will be the primary option to reach the target market for consumptive credit in this segment in 2022, which are supported by Kopra by Mandiri and Livin’ by Mandiri.
The combination of partnership with leading marketplaces and direct offering by sales forces becomes the key work plan for Micro Multipurpose Loans, Home Loans, Auto Loan, and Credit Card business in 2022.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK358 SOLVENCY AND ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE COLLECTABILITY Solvency The ability to pay debts is reflected in the liquidity and solvency of the bank.
Regarding bonds issued, the ability to pay debts is reflected in the efficient interest payments and bond ratings.
In addition to successfully achieving solid financial performance in 2021, Bank Mandiri also had adequate liquidity to meet short-term and long-term obligations.
Ability to Pay Short-Term Debt  (Bank Liquidity)To measure liquidity, Bank Mandiri uses several indicators, including the ratio of Statutory Reserve Requirement at Bank Indonesia and Cash, Macroprudential Liquidity Buffers (PLM), liquidity reserves, Macroprudential Intermediation Ratio (RIM), Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
The position of these indicators as of December 2021 is as follows: • Bank Mandiri’s average  Rupiah Statutory Reserves position (bank only) was recorded at 3.97% of the total Rupiah third-party funds, per the predetermined limit.
Meanwhile, RIM’s Current Account was 1.17% and PLM was 27.57% of the total Rupiah TPF.
Meanwhile, the foreign currency reserve requirement was 4.10% of the total foreign currency deposit per the set limit.
• In managing liquidity reserves, Bank Mandiri had a limit in the form of a safety level limit, namely the projection of liquidity reserves for the next month.
At the end of December 2021, Bank Mandiri’s liquidity reserves were above the safety level.
• RIM is the ratio of the results of the comparison between loans and corporate securities that meet certain requirements held against TPF, securities that meet certain requirements issued by banks, and loans that meet certain requirements received.
Bank Mandiri’s RIM was recorded at 78.35% (bank only).
• LCR is the ratio between High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) and the estimated total net cash outflow for the next 30 days in a crisis scenario.
LCR aims to increase the short-term liquidity resilience of banks in times of crisis.
Bank Mandiri’s LCR (bank only) was at the level of 200.56%, above the Regulator’s regulation which stipulates that the minimum LCR fulfillment is 100%.
• • NSFR is the ratio between available stable funding and required stable funding.
Bank Mandiri’s NSFR (bank only) reached 126.20%, above the regulator’s stipulation that the minimum NSFR fulfillment is 100%.
Ability to Pay Long-Term Debt (Bank Solvency)In 2021, Bank Mandiri had a high capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at the level of 19.60% or a slight decrease from the previous year’s position of 19.90%.
This ratio shows that Bank Mandiri’s solvency was still good because it had exceeded the minimum CAR ratio requirement from the regulator so that it could meet credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.
Bank Mandiri’s future liquidity  conditions are projected through the liquidity gap methodology, which is a maturity mismatch between the components of assets and liabilities (including off-balance sheets), which are organized into periods (time buckets) based on contractual maturity or behavioral maturity.
In December 2021, Bank Mandiri’s liquidity for the next 12 months was projected to be in a surplus position.
Nevertheless, Bank Mandiri always prepares alternative funding if market liquidity conditions become tight or do not match predictions.
To determine the impact of changes  in market factors and internal factors in extreme conditions (crisis) on liquidity conditions, Bank Mandiri conducts stress-testing of liquidity risk regularly.
The stress-testing results show that Bank Mandiri can survive the liquidity crisis.
However, Bank Mandiri  FINANCIAL REVIEW 2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION359also has a Liquidity Contingency  Plan (LCP) which includes funding strategies and pricing strategies in crisis conditions, including money market loans, repos, bilateral loans, FX swaps, and wholesale funding.
In the LCP , the determination of liquidity conditions and funding strategies has taken into account internal and external conditions.
Ability to Pay Debt from Issued SecuritiesThe ability to pay debts can also be reflected based on the ratings of the securities issued by Bank Mandiri and its Subsidiaries, which may include Bonds, Medium Term Notes (MTN), and Global Bonds.
Securities issued are routinely assessed by rating agencies to support the suitability of securities.
The quality of securities is largely determined by the ability of the issuing company to pay the securities at maturity and the ability to pay interest or coupons during the period of issuance of the securities.
Bonds and MTN issued by Bank Mandiri are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange with Pefindo and Fitch Rating Indonesia as the rating agencies.
These two rating agencies give a favorable assessment of the securities issued by Bank Mandiri.
Meanwhile, Global Bonds (Euro Medium Term Notes/EMTN) are issued and listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange and offered to investors outside the United States, subject to Regulation S based on the US Securities Act.

Bank Rentability Bank Mandiri’s rentability (bank only) is measured using the following ratios.

This ROE and ROA achievement increased significantly compared to 2020 which were 9.36 % and 1.64%.
Meanwhile, Bank Mandiri’s Net Interest Margin (NIM) reached 4.73%, moving from the previous year’s position of 4.48%.
This achievement is in line with the improvements made by Bank Mandiri for credit performance and credit restructuring programs, as well as the Indonesian economy which is gradually recovering.
Meanwhile, the Cost Efficiency Ratio (CER) reached 44.67% and the ratio of Operating Expenses to Operating Income (BOPO) could be reduced from the previous 80.03% in 2020 to 67.26% in 2021.

This more conducive situation and conditions were optimized VERY well by Bank Mandiri.
One example is the ratio of Non-Performing Loans (NPL), which was reduced to the level of 2.81% at the end of 2021, down by 48 bps compared to 2020 which was 3.29%.
This shows that Bank Mandiri could improve the balance between healthy credit expansion and prudent credit management during 2021, both in the wholesale and retail segments.
Bank Mandiri’s credit management  process for the wholesale segment begins with determining the target market through the Portfolio Guideline which establishes Industry Classification (attractive, neutral, selective) and appropriate industry limits, as well as selecting and screening target customers through Industry Acceptance Criteria and Name Clearance, to produce a pipeline of qualified debtors.
The next process is to carry out a credit risk assessment using a series of credit risk tools (credit risk rating, spreadsheet, CPA, NAK, and so on), the result of which is then decided by the Credit Decision Authority (through the Credit Committee Meeting) with the Four-Eyes Principle involving the Business Unit and Credit Risk Management Unit independently.
For the retail segment, because it is  a mass market, the credit process is carried out more automatically using a credit risk scorecard pursuant to the Risk Acceptance Criteria for each product, and is processed through an automated workflow (loan factory).
Bank Mandiri’s monitoring process  is carried out on a portfolio basis through the Portfolio Quality Review, which can be continued with the collection and recovery process for the problematic portion of the portfolio.
To anticipate deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, Bank Mandiri conducted a what-if analysis of the wholesale and retail portfolios through a stress testing process using certain macroeconomic scenarios.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE Risk management through capitalBank Mandiri’s capital policy is to prudently meet regulatory capital requirements, diversify sources of capital to anticipate long-term strategic plans, and allocate capital efficiently to business segments that have the potential to provide an optimal risk-return profile, including placements and investments in subsidiaries to meet the expectations of stakeholders including investors and regulators.
Bank Mandiri ensures that it has  sufficient capital to meet credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, both to support business growth under normal conditions and to anticipate stressful conditions.
In calculating capital adequacy, the  Bank refers to the Financial Services Authority Regulation Number 34/POJK.03/2016 dated 22 September 2016 regarding changes to POJK Number 11/POJK.03/2016 concerning the Minimum Capital Adequacy Requirement for Commercial Banks.
For the calculation of Risk-Weighted  Assets (ATMR), the Bank uses the Basel II Standard Approach (Standardized Approach) for Credit Risk and has included an External Rating component.
In addition, the Bank has gradually simulated an Internal Rating-Based Approach.
For Market Risk, the Bank uses the Basel II Standard Measurement Method (Standardized Measurement FINANCIAL REVIEW MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK362 Method) and internally uses Value  at Risk.
For Operational Risk, the Bank refers to the Basel II Basic Indicator Approach (Basic Indicator Approach).
The results of the calculation of the ATMR (Credit, Operational, and Market) and the Capital Adequacy Ratio for the position of December 31, 2021, and 2020 (Bank Mandiri only) are as follows: Bank Mandiri Capital Structure 2019-2021(in Rp million) Capital Component 2021 2020 2019 Capital: Core Modal 165,492,705 155,646,179 179,161,161 Supplementary Capital 9,764,189 9,011,176 9,667,098 Total capital for Credit Risk, Operational Risk, and Market Risk 175,256,894 164,657,355 188,828,259 Credit Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) 757,497,030 688,150,152 731,563,854 Operational Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) 130,682,428 128,716,464 123,291,988 Market Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) 5,849,789 10,594,562 28,049,779 Total ATMR for Credit Risk, Operational Risk, and Market Risk 894,029,247 827,46,.178 882,905,621 Tabel Rasio Kecukupan Modal Capital Component 2021 2020 2019 CAR For Core Capital 18.51% 18.81% 20.29% CAR For Credit Risk 23.14% 23.93% 25.81% CAR For Operational and Credit Risk 19.73% 20.16% 22.09% CAR For Market and Credit Risk 22.96% 23.56% 24.86% CAR For Market, Operational, and Credit Risk 19.60% 19.90% 21.39% CAR Minimum Core Capital 6.00% 6.00% 6.00% CAR Minimum According to Risk Profile 9.75% 9.83% 9,59% The Bank’s consolidated capital adequacy ratio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020 taking into account credit,  operational and market risks was 19.56% and 19.58%, respectively, taking into account credit and operational risks of 19.67% and 19.81%.

EKMS is a platform whose main feature is to facilitate social learning, namely peer-to-peer learning.
Social learning through EKMS is  part of the 60:20:10:10 approach that focuses on 60% (experiential learning), 20% (social learning), 10% (formal online learning), and 10% (formal offline learning) with an approach of “learning in the flow of work”, which emphasizes beyond classroom learning, where learning can be accessed anytime and anywhere.
In the EKMS platform, employees  are encouraged to share their  knowledge and experiences that were previously “tacit” (abstractly owned and understood by experts only) to become “explicit” knowledge, or knowledge that has been structured and can be understood by others.
This is the main philosophy of EKMS, which is to organize and record abstract knowledge owned by each work unit at Bank Mandiri, and make explicit knowledge for bank-wide consumption.
Currently, the focus of EKMS development is developing Community of Practice (CoP), Social Learning, and Library/ Learning Catalogue.
EMPLOYEE  PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT The employee performance  assessment conducted by the Bank not only measures results (Achievements), but also how  the application of culture and  leadership characteristics are applied in their daily work (Attitude).
Since 2019, Bank Mandiri has implemented a 360-degree Survey component to measure Attitude of employee performance at the minus-1 BOD level.
In 2020, the 360-degree Survey assessment was extended to minus-2 BOD.
This assessment extension was done so that all leaders at Bank Mandiri were able to be assessed through a wider perspective and gain reliable input for continuous improvement in terms of performance, leadership, and decision-making.
In 2021, the survey was again re-extended for Senior Executive Vice President (SEVP) level.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  & ANALYSIS PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK450 The assessment components were  also refined through an integration of 10 Leadership Characteristics parameter with 6 Core Values of BUMN-AKHLAK as a reflection for leaders implementing these core values.
These improvements were made to create a transparent assessment process based on factual conditions in the field and maintain integrity on which policies, recommended distribution, fairness, and consistency rested with respect to employee performance.
Performance Assessment System The employee performance system is based on employee achievement per the established Key Performance Indicator (KPI) (Achievement) and the implementation  of the AKHLAK culture (Attitude).
The performance elements assessed consist of Process and Result.
Process shows how to achieve targets (lead measure) and Result shows the achievement of targets by the employees (log measure).
The performance assessment  results are divided into 5 (five) categories:1.
Superior Performance, showing outstanding/extraordinary performance 2.
Very Good Performance, showing satisfactory/very good performance 3.
Good Performance, showing good performance/meeting expectations 4.
Requires some improvement, showing the need for improvements to help with the quality of performance5.
Under Performance, not showing the appropriate/expected performance.
In employee performance assessment, employees first set goals at the beginning of the year and perform a mid-year review for readjustment (if needed) to their performance.
Further, at the end of year period, employees are given the opportunity to perform a self-assessment of their achievements.
Then the results of the self-assessment will be discussed, reviewed, and validated by the Employee Manager (direct supervisor) and then calibrated by the Employee Manager’s Manager.
The parties who play a role in employee performance appraisal are described in the following figure.
Who plays a role in an  individual assessment?
Employee Employees make a  self-assessment Employee Manager Manager the supervisor of the direct supervisor  provides a final level assessment by  considering the normal distributionEmployee Manager The supervisor immediately gives a final score and an initial performance level Matrix Manager The head of the work unit who is the supervisor of the system or segment of the employees placed in a region for certain positions, the Employee Manager, will receive input/revision/comments from the matrix manager in determining employee performance assessment1 2 3 4HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT PT BANK MANDIRI (PERSERO) TBK  ENHANCING DIGITAL BANKING TRANSFORMATION  & INNOVATION451The performance assessment  system is expected to encourage employees to improve performance in the next period.
The result of the performance assessment is used as one of the factors in determining compensation, talent category, and promotion.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT The Bank takes the emotional attachment of its employees to the Company very seriously.
This is done through improving the welfare of all employees so that they can work together to offer optimal productivity.

Employee Remuneration For each job level, Bank Mandiri does not differentiate between the basic salary and remuneration between women and men.
