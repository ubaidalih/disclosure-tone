In line with the Government’s economic growth target, PGN assesses that the business prospects for 2023 are very positive, especially considering natural gas which serves as the main alternative energy source as a transitional energy toward renewable energy phase.
An adequate supply of gas, which is also relatively more environmentally friendly, stimulates an increase in coal and fuel conversion activities.
As a result of the increasingly conducive climate for post COVID-19 economic recovery, which has started since 2021, the increase in business activities requires energy sources that are expected to directly impact PGN's performance onaconsolidatedbasis.
From a global perspective, the global energy supply and demandsituationispredictedtoremainunstablein2023, drivenbythegeopoliticalsituationsoftheRussia-Ukraine war, which we have not seen the light at the end of the tunnelyet.
Thissituationwillleadtovolatilityinglobaloil pricesandLNGspotprices.
PGNhaspreparedanumberofdevelopmentinitiativesin response to this situation, including developing the LNG HubbusinessbyutilizingtheAruninfrastructurewhilealso meeting the needs for gas generated from LNG ex- regasification for Aceh and North Sumatra regions, developing the LNG Bunkering business in Bontang, developing infrastructure to meet domestic LNG needs, such as developing facilities for retail LNG business developmentintheJavaregionandtheneedsoftheRUIV Cilacap Refinery and the surrounding industry as well as optimizingtheutilizationoftheLampungFloatingStorage andRegasificationUnit(FSRU).
In 2023, PGN will also continue the initiative, which is an assignment from the Government through PT Pertamina (Persero) as Oil and Gas Holding for gasifying PLN's power plants using LNG supplies.
The LNG facilities for PLN's power plants can serve as the maingatefordevelopingthelocalgasmarket.
Inaddition, PGN will continue to carry out the Government's assignment for the construction of the household gas network while at the same time reaching out to Small- scale customers who are located around the household gasnetwork.
As a Gas Subholding that integrates natural gas infrastructure in Indonesia, PGN is optimistic that it can improvenaturalgastradingmanagementbyaround1,058 BBTUDin2023andcontinuetoincreaseto22%in2026.
As an alt ernative to gas supply from conventional reserves, which tend to drop due to a natural decline, domestic demand, which is projected to continue to increase,willbemetwithLNGsupplies.
On the demand front, the industrial sector remains the anchor demand, followed by the electricity sector.
The smelter and refinery industries are projected to increase demandfornaturalgasconsistentwiththeGovernment's programtoboosttheconstructionofsmeltersandrefinery development.
PGN has prepared several strategic steps to address future challenges and business development efforts that span all energy potential in the gas sector, particularly in Indonesia.
The goal is for PGN to dominate not only the midstreamsector,includingnaturalgasinfrastructureand distribution,butalsotheentirevaluechain,fromupstream todownstream.
PGN, as a Company engaged in the transmission and distribution of natural gas and as a Gas Subholding, continues to strive to strengthen its role in distributing goodenergyasadriverofeconomicgrowthinIndonesia by building Indonesia’s first LNG Bunkering.
One of the driving factors is that Indonesia’s territorial waters are a very strategic location for international shipping routes where the number of ships sailing through Indonesian waters reaches hundreds of thousands of ships in one year.
The Malacca Strait and Makassar Strait are one of Indonesia’ sbusiestinternationalshippingroutes.
existing bunkering stations owned by Singapore and Malaysia,locatedaroundtheMalaccaStrait,whichhave long been operating, the potential for developing bunkering stations in the Makassar Strait area is more promising.
ShippingTrafficAroundLNGBunkeringFacilities • TheMalaccaStraitandtheMakassarStraitareoneof Indonesia'sbusiestinternationalshippingroutes.
• LNG market penetration as a marine fuel is currently only0.01%oftheworld'stotalfleet.
TheeffectofIMO 2020 is expected to increase LNG penetration as a marinefuelto1%in2035.
Since2020,theInternationalMaritimeOrganization(IMO) has adopted the IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap regulation whereby ships on international shipping routes passing throughtheECA(EmissionControlArea)zonesmustnot exceed the 0.1% sulfur content limit generated from the combustion; and ships entering the Global Cap zones mustnotexceedthesulfurcontentlimitof0.5%generated fromthecombustion.
Severalalternativefuelscanbeused to obtain a sulfur content below 0.5%; for example, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
Several countries have operatedLNGbunkeringprojectstomeetLNGneedsfor ships using LNG fuel, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Netherlands,Norway,China,theUnitedStates,Belgium, Canada,SouthKorea,Japan,andFrance.
Considering the adoptio n of IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap r egulationandthestrategiclocationofIndonesianwaters for international shipping routes, the potential for developingLNGbunkeringinIndonesiaisverypromising.
This is also in line with one of the Seven National GassificationsProgramsknownas"SaptaPGN+",namely Gas for the Maritime Sector, which PGN has launched.
Through the implementation of the LNG bunkering program, PNG gained benefits, which are increasing revenuefromgas(LNG)sales,improvingtheutilizationof infrastructureownedbyPertaminaGroup(PTBadakNGL and PT Perta Arun Gas) as well as being a pioneer in creatingtheLNGmarketfordomesticshippingsector.
In an effort to reduce imports of fuel oil by 2030 and to supportcarbonemissionreduction,theGovernmenthas formulatedseveralstrategicstepsoutlinedintheNational Energy Grand Strategy (GSEN) document.
One of the accelerated steps in implementing the program is optimizingbiofuelsbyintensifyingtheuseandproduction of biofuels (biodiesel or bio-hydrocarbons including bioethanol).
The said biofuels cover optimization of the products from Palm Oil Mills (POM) and their derivative productsthatstillhavebenefitsfortheenvironment.
Palm oil i ndustry is an important part of the national economy with a transaction value of USD28.52 billion in 2021 or equivalent to 4.5% of Income Per Capita (GDP).
The potential for environmental pollution is related to the amount of waste and emissions generated from palm oil productionactivities,inwhichmainproducts(CrudePalm Oil(CPO)andPalmKernelOil(PKO))onlyrepresent26.3% of the total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) used as production raw materials.
A total of 44.5% of the FFB becomes biomass by-products, including Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), palm shells, mesocarp fiber, and palm kernel expeller.
Meanwhile, the highest productivity of by- products is liquid waste (Palm Oil Mill Effluent/POME reaches58%orequivalenttotheamountofFFB),inwhich most of the POME is processed by the anaerobic fermentation method in open ponds that part of the products are to be used as fertilizer and the remaining productisnotutilized/discarded.
AsanefforttodeveloptheCompany'sbusiness,including optimizing PGN's pipeline network and supporting the implementation process of GENS and the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Program, PGN recognizes the potential for providing clean energy (Biomethane) as alternative energytodriveeconomicgrowthinIndonesia.

Inaddition,PGNalsosynergizesinternallywithPertamina Group in constructing infrastructure for the Senipah- Balikpapan pipeline to flow gas to the RU V Balikpapan refinery.
In 2022, it reached the construction phase, and commissioning & gas-in are targeted to be achieved in mid-2023.
To support the Government's program to reduce LPG imports, PGN will expand the use of natural gas to the household segment, with a target of 4 million customers by 2024.
This activity is part of the Gas Kita Pintar program.
Inthefuture,apartfromthedevelopmentofgas networks independently, PGN plans to partner with businessentitiestodevelopthisgasnetwork.
Taking into account PGN's experience and capability in thetransportationbusinessusingthepipelinemodeand thesynergyofPertaminaGroup,PGNsupportsPertamina throughtheconstructionoftheRokanoilpipeline,witha total length of 360 km, which has been operating since November2022.
In 2022, PGN succeeded in achieving the current year’s targets in the Company Work Plan and Budget (RKAP), supported by positive operational performance.
The realization of natural gas management in 2022 consistedofnaturalgastradingof896BBTUDor83.2%of the 2022 RKAP and natural gas transportation of 1,349 MMSCFD or 97.5% of the 2022 RKAP.
