Equity contributes a significantly large portion to  the capital structure at 83%.
There was a slight increase in  capital structure in 2022 compared to 2021 with the equity portion reaching 80%.
Capital Structure Policy  Optimal capital structure supports low capital cost,  maximizes shareholder value, and generates a good credit  rating (low risk).
The Company is committed to creating  shareholder value by maintaining a high Return on Equity  ratio.
Capex and new projects will be prioritized and financed  by internal cash, long-term debt or bonds.
MATERIAL COMMITMENT FOR  CAPITAL GOODS INVESTMENTS In 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries did not make any  material investment commitments for capital goods (20%  of the equity value).
In 2022, the Company realized capital goods investments  of Rp293 billion, which were primarily intended to support the Company’s operations.
COMPARISON OF TARGET  AND REALIZATION Sales and Revenue Sales and revenues increased by 86% to Rp47,540 billion,  a significant increase from the set target.
This growth was  supported by an increase in selling prices and volumes.
Global prices for energy and basic chemicals increased  significantly in the second half of 2022.
This was due to  global supply chain constraints caused by the post-COVID-19  supply chain not yet being fully recovered, but also by global  geopolitical turmoil due to the conflict in Europe.
Both of  these factors increased selling prices for the Company.
The  volume of products distributed was also higher in line with  the increasing demand from the Company’s consumers.
Profit Core profit growth attributable to owners of the parent entity  for continuing operations increased significantly by 116%  to Rp2,403 billion.
This is the third year running with a very  strong performance, following increases of 20% in 2021 and  30% in 2020, despite the very challenging conditions.
This  achievement represents a very strong performance in a  very challenging environment.
Net profit growth was in line  with 1) stable business performance that resulted in gross  profit growth of 85% to Rp4,252 billion, 2) strict control over  operating costs that resulted in operating profit growth of 112% to Rp3,087 billion, and 3) reduced financial expenses due to working capital management.
A detailed analysis of  the profit increase has been previously presented in the  Financial Review section of this Annual Report.
Return on Capital and Capital Structure The rate of return on capital attributable to the parent entity  was 22%, higher than12% in 2021.

The Company has a prudent Capital  Structure policy that takes into account the risk of interest rate movements and potential investment opportunities in new businesses. 2023 PROJECTIONS  Bank Indonesia has predicted GDP growth for 2023 of 4.5%- 5.3%, higher than Indonesia’s GDP growth in 2022 of 5.31%.
This higher growth is based on increased domestic demand,  including household consumption, and an improved  investment climate together with the completion of National  Strategic Projects, as well as increased export performance  amid the slowing global economic growth.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is predicted to decline  and return to the target of 3.0 ± 1% in 2023.
Core inflation will  return earlier in the first half of 2023, together with imported  inflation due to the stable Rupiah exchange rate, and a  front-loaded, pre-emptive and forward-looking monetary  policy response.
Based on the improving economic prospects, improved  export performance, increased added value from the Smelter  operating in Indonesia, and increased manufacturing  competitiveness, the Company will strive to deliver another  year of healthy growth in 2023.
The JIIPE SEZ profile and attractiveness increased  significantly in 2022, with its status as a Special Economic Zone, which will provide fiscal and non-fiscal advantages, as well as accelerated progress in the Copper Smelter and  Precious Metals Refinery, as an anchor tenant at JIIPE, and  this is expected to attract foreign and domestic investors so  that a strategic industrial downstreaming ecosystem can  be established efficiently.
As Indonesia is expected to enter the investment cycle, we  are confident we can accelerate land sales to investors in  line with the Indonesian Government’s vision of Industry 4.0.
Sales and Revenues We expect steady volume growth in petroleum and chemical  sales in the coming year.
at a higher level than pre-COVID 19, will further support  our revenue growth.

BUSINESS PROSPECTS Petroleum Trading & Distribution Prospects The Company will maintain the momentum of industrial  fuel volume growth in 2023.
The Company’s 2023 volume  growth target is based on, 1) improvements in the economy  and increasing industry competitiveness 2) marketing to  new customers, 3) increasing activity in the mineral mining  sector 4) full mobility following the repeal of the Restrictions  on Community Activities and 5) increasing investments  originating from overseas.
The Company distributes petroleum through a disciplined  risk management business model.
BBM distribution to industrial/business customers in 2022  shows significant growth due to the high demand for fuel products.
The Company hopes that this trend will continue in 2023. 1.
Mining Higher prices of major commodities produced by Indonesia in 2022 will trigger mining companies in  Indonesia to carry out pre-stripping ratios where the  stripping ratio from a mine’s production will increase.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources targets  coal production to increase by 4.8%.
In addition, other  mineral mines have also increased their mining activities  in line with the growing demand for raw materials such  as nickel, bauxite and others driven by the Government’s  downstream program. 2.
Smelter  Value addition in the mining sector is creating demand  for petroleum products and chemicals.
The 2020 Law No.  3 as an amendment to the 2009 Law No. 4 concerning  Mineral and Coal Mining prohibits the export of raw  materials.
The downstreaming program encourages the  use of raw materials to produce value added products.
Mineral products such as copper, nickel, gold, tin,  bauxite and aluminum must be processed in smelters before obtaining export permits.
The Government is confident that the availability of refined products will expand domestic production,  especially as the smelting process requires additional  energy and chemicals.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources projects 17 new smelters in 2023, where 20 of  the 17 smelters are independent, while the remaining  12 are integrated with mines with most being nickel  smelters.
(Press Conference: 2022 Minerba Subsector  Achievements and 2023 Work Program, January 31, 2023) 3.
Plantations Heavy equipment in the plantation sector also uses diesel fuel.
AKR’s main plantation customers come  from palm oil plantations.
The Acting Chairman of the  Indonesian Palm Oil Board (DMSI) estimates that crude  palm oil production in 2023 will reach 52.5 million tons,  Annual Report 2022 PT AKR Corporindo Tbk153 ton, naik 2,9% dari produksi tahun 2022 sebesar 51 juta ton.

This year’s FAME  production is also predicted to increase to 10 million  tons, from 8.8 million tons in 2022.
This increase has  been influenced by the Government’s policy to increase  the vegetable content of biodiesel fuel from B30 to B35.
Export prices are expected to remain at record highs  within an estimated range of USD 800 per ton to USD  880 per ton.

Bunker Services (petroleum delivery & transportation  services) Mining bunkers and fishery bunkers use petroleum  from AKR.
The prospect of petroleum sales growth in  mining bunkers is certainly in line with the mining  industry prospects.
While the fishery bunkers demand  is determined by factors that influence fishing activities  such as weather, location, and policies related to marine  and fisheries management. 5.
General Market Increased economic activity will generate a broad  demand for the products distributed by the Company.
These include the manufacturing, trade, construction, and transportation sectors. 6.
Power Plant The Company distributes petroleum to Government- owned and private power plants when required. 7.
Retail The Company believes that the retail sector has enormous  potential.
Currently, the ratio gas stations to the total  population in Indonesia is still very low.
In addition, the  increase in the number of motorized vehicles each year  is quite high.
The retail business is carried out through AKR retail outlets and AKR-bp joint venture outlets.
In the subsidized fuel segment, the Company only sells  diesel fuel through AKR Retail Outlets.
Based on the  Head of the Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency  Decree Number 72/P3JBT/BPHMIGAS/KOM/2022 dated  15 August 2022 and Number 126/P3JBT/BPHMIGAS/ KOM/2022 dated 23 December 2022, the Company has  been reappointed by BPH Migas as the Business Entity  Implementing Agency for the Supply and Distribution  of Specific Fuel (P3JBT)  for year 2023-2027 and has  Laporan Tahunan 2022 PT AKR Corporindo Tbk154 ANALISIS DAN PEMBAHASAN MANAJEMEN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISkl untuk tahun 2023 AKR akan mendukung pertumbuhan  volume dan terus berupaya mendistribusikannya dengan  efektif dan efisien.
received a quota to distribute 177 thousand of subsidized  fuel in 2023, AKR will support volume growth and will  distribute it in effective and efficient manner.
In 2022, the AKR-bp joint venture operated 36 outlets.
Following the Government’s policy to allow the selling  price of RON 92 fuel to be based on market prices, the  AKR-bp price disparity with its competitors has narrowed,  and we expect this will boost volumes significantly in the  upcoming years.
These outlets have been opened in  Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Malang and toll rest areas. 8.
Aviation Fuel Indonesia, as the largest country in Southeast Asia in  terms of area, population, and economy, has the largest  aviation market in ASEAN.
Indonesia has a demographic  bonus or young population that is a market potential  in the aviation business.
Infrastructure development  to connect production areas with distribution areas  that facilitate access to tourism areas has become a  Government program in recent years.
For this reason, the  Government is trying to build new airports in Indonesia.
The Government is also encouraging new private aviation  fuel distributors to support the tourism sector.
The JV Company under PT Dirgantara Petroindo Raya  became the first private company to receive a permanent  INU license to distribute aviation fuel in Indonesia.
Following the first aviation fuel filling depot opened at  IMIP Morowali Airport, the Company has opened a second  depot at one helipad in Cibubur.
Basic Chemicals Trading & Distribution Prospects The Company targets consistent volume growth in 2023,  continuing the positive trend in 2022 where sales in 2022  grew according to management expectations due to  Indonesia’s GDP growth post-COVID-19 and demand from  the mining sector and the metal processing industry.
The  mineral downstream program launched by the Government,  supported by a ban on the export of raw minerals such as  nickel and bauxite, will increase the growth of mineral  smelters in Indonesia.
The Government through the Ministry  of Energy and Mineral Resources is targeting the operation of  53 smelters by 2024 consisting of different types of smelters  for nickel and alumina throughout Indonesia, of which 17  will be completed in 2023.
The additional smelters will  significantly increase the need for basic chemicals such  as caustic soda and sulfuric acid.
Chemical prices in 2022 experienced a sharp increase in  selling prices compared to the previous year.
This was due  to the increasing demand for basic chemicals domestically  and globally, as well as the supply chain disruptions, one  being the energy crisis that occurred in Europe.
Manufacturing Prospects Aruki’s growth is driven by growth in the national property  market and timber industry in Indonesia.
Furniture and  furniture exports in 2023 are estimated to grow by around  8 percent to US$3.67 billion compared to 2022, so the  Company expects stable growth in volume and selling prices.
However, the Company continues to implement conservative  projections for export growth, due to the Russia-Ukraine  conflict.
Exporting companies will continue to grow due to Bank  Indonesia holding the interest rate at a level of 3.5 percent,  and the easing of property ownership loans down payments to  zero percent, and Value Added Tax Borne by the Government  (VAT DTP) up to 50 percent.
These Government initiatives  and incentives will allow industry businesses to be more  optimistic about the property market in Indonesia.
This  increased the demand for furniture and furnishing for the  domestic market even though exports decreased due to  the conflict.
Logistics Prospects The high cost of logistics due to Indonesia’s geography as  an archipelagic country, and the geopolitical conditions in  Europe, resulted in logistics and supply chain disruptions  so that logistics costs increased sharply due to increased  fuel costs and the scarcity of modes of transportation in  addition to the challenges of infrastructure availability.
The  reduction in logistics costs has become more vital compared  to previous years, where efficiencies could only be achieved  by improving connectivity.
The Company has complete logistics & supply chain facilities  throughout Indonesia.
With a total of 17 ports, and a trusted  IT system to monitor the movement of goods, the Company  is ready to support the Company’s trading and distribution business and provide logistic services for third parties. 1.
Fuel tank storage & transportation  Even though the world economy is predicted to slow  down in 2023, with the complete removal of mobility  restrictions and also the Government program to encourage the manufacturing and downstream  minerals industry in Indonesia, means the demand for  petroleum is expected to stabilize in 2023.
This will drive  the demand for distribution, and storage facilities for  liquid bulk products.
Through AKR Sea Transport (AST), the Company  distributes fuel to the islands using 12 of our own Self  Propelled Oil Barges (SPOB).
While land distribution is  carried out using trucks belonging to AKR Transport  Indonesia (ATI), with a total of 250 trucks. 2.
Jakarta Tank Terminal (JTT)JTT has a total storage capacity of 350,000 cbm and its capacity utilization is expected to increase in line with  the increasing demand for fuel.
Strategically located at  Tanjung Priok, the main seaport in Jakarta, JTT serves  the fuel products import and distribution market in the  Greater Jakarta area.
Fuel product imports, especially  petroleum, have increased rapidly in Indonesia,  especially in Jakarta and the island of Java, where the  demand is expected to be higher after the removal of  people’s mobility restrictions.
This growth is expected  to grow further driven by Indonesia’s economic and  population growth.
The demand for storage tank facilities  is expected to increase due to expanding gasoline  distribution by the fuel industry businesses 3.
Bulk and Containers The Company through Usaha Era Pratama Nusantara  (UEPN) serves the loading and unloading of dry bulk and  containers in Surabaya.
In addition, PT Berlian Manyar  Sejahtera (BMS) operates the port services of Manyar  Terminal at Gresik Port, East Java and has a 76-year  concession from the Ministry of Transportation, and  can handle up to 5.4 million MT/year.
Currently BMS is  also expanding its jetties to support the copper smelter  facility built at JIIPE Gresik, from 2 vessel-mooring  points to 4.
Industrial Estate Prospects The Company believes that in the future Indonesia will  become increasingly attractive to many foreign and domestic  investments.
This will increase the demand for an industrial  estate that can reduce logistics costs through increasing  multi-modal connectivity, especially from the manufacturing  and processing-based industries.
With Pelindo III, the  Company is developing the Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE), which in 2021 was awarded the status of a Special Economic Zone so that its name has changed to JIIPE Gresik SEZ.
JIIPE Gresik SEZ was established in 2013 as part of the  Company’s vision to improve connectivity for businesses in  Indonesia.
The 3,000 hectare project includes an Industrial  Estate, Deep Sea Port and Residential Area strategically  located in East Java, close to the Madura Strait.
Java Integrated Industrial & Port Estate (JIIPE) provides  many unique advantages for tenants including an integrated industrial estate and port, in-house power  generation, availability of recycled water with zero runoff,  telecommunications services, and connectivity via land  transportation.
JIIPE’s status as a Special Economic Zone or SEZ was granted  by the President of the Republic of Indonesia based on  Government Regulation 71, dated June 28, 2021, and covers  2,167 hectares of land that includes an Industrial Estate  and Deep Sea Port.
As a result, investors will have a wide  range of advantages, including fiscal incentives such as  tax exemptions, bonded warehouses, ease of movement of goods, employment incentives, further easing of licensing and one-stop approval for permits.
Combining the SEZ benefits with the facilities available  at JIIPE, the cost of doing business will be comparable, if  not better, than other parts of ASEAN.
JIIPE targets large,  capital-intensive industries to fully utilize the facilities and  services we offer.
The target is to attract US$17 billion in  investment and create 20,000 new jobs.
In addition, potential  Investors can now immediately apply for available benefits,  significantly reducing their project gestation period.
An 20-year Long-term lease agreement with extension of 6  periods of 10 years for a Copper Smelter & Precious Metal  Refinery facility was signed in 2019 with one of Indonesia’s  largest mining companies to develop a new copper smelter  complex, covering 100 hectares at an estimated cost of  US$3 billion.
The project will become the world’s largest  copper smelter and include a precious metal refinery.
This project also signed an 85 hectare land lease agreement for the Laydown Area during the construction process.
In 2022, the Company also signed a power supply agreement  with PLN to supply electricity for the smelter facility needs,  where the approved scheme is that PLN will supply high- voltage electricity to JIIPE, and JIIPE as the owner of the  Electricity Generation Business Permit (IUPTL) will distribute  electricity according to specifications to the copper smelter.
This will encourage ongoing revenue growth, as well as  other facilities at JIIPE.
BMS also signed a separate 40  year agreement for the construction and use of the BMS  Infrastructure.
The copper smelter project started construction at JIIPE  in mid-2019, and is expected to be operational in 2024.
This smelter’s operations will encourage the growth of  other industries wanting to process by-products using the  smelting process, and with other heavy industries will later  establish a industrial ecosystem for its copper and derivative- based products.
In 2022 BKMS also sold 44.5 hectares of industrial estate  land including land sales to international investor, a leading  glass producer globally for 37.5 hectares and balance to other  companies intending to set up factories in JIIPE.
the rest of  land sales was purchased by a domestic steel companies  expanding its land to 4.5 Hectares for the additional facilities.
In 2023, we expect higher revenue from JIIPE SEZ, due  to: 1.
lease income from smelter project and also higher land  interest from ecosystem related to copper & EV battery segments and other industries MARKETING ASPECTS Petroleum The marketing strategy for the industrial fuel distribution  business is as follows: 1.

They also  had a direct impact on the Company’s business activities,  particularly in the trading and distribution business line.
However, with its long experience, the Company faced these  challenges and the Company’s business activities continued  and grew well throughout 2022.
Some of the key factors for  this achievement were: 1.
The Company has a broad and strong network. 2.
Risk control is based on business model. 3.
A complete logistics & supply chain infrastructure from  upstream to downstream. 4.
IT systems that monitor movement, inventory, and  product status. 5.
