The Company derives its total sales and other operating revenues  from net oil and gas sales, drilling operations and related services, net  methanol sales, electric power sales, and O&M services and LPG sales.
A large majority of such revenues are denominated in US Dollar.
For  the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded  total sales and other operating revenues of USD 620.2 million and 550.1  million, respectively, and EBITDA of USD 328.2 million and USD 254.8  million, respectively.
Net oil and gas sales accounted for 70% and 67%  of the Company’s total sales and other operating revenues in 2005 and  2004, respectively.
Below is summary of the Company’s financial results  for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Under the EJVA, Anadarko has  committed to a three-year work program to fund certain exploration  activities of the Company under 13 PSCs at a minimum cost of USD 80  million.
Entitlement minyak mentah yang tidak dijual dalam kontrak penjualan the Company’s initial interest in a PSC where a successful exploration  well is drilled at Anadarko’s cost.
Divestment of Middle East Assets  In July 2005, the Company sold all of the Novus Group’s remaining  Middle East assets, which consisted of one producing gas and  condensate block and three exploration blocks, to Meridian Oil & Gas  (Middle East) Limited, a Cayman Islands company associated with Silk  Route Investments, a Cayman Islands company, at a price of USD 65  million (subject to working capital adjustments).
The Company will  retain the right to re-acquire a 10% interest in the assets if there is a  commercial discovery within three years of the sale.
Farm-out and Farm-in at Jeruk Oil Field The Company entered into a Jeruk Participation and Operating  Agreement (“Jeruk Agreement”) with Santos (Sampang) Pty.
(“Santos (Sampang)”) on November 5, 2003, for the sole risk exploration  on the Jeruk field on a 50:50 cost and recovery sharing basis, with  Santos (Sampang) as the operator (the “Jeruk Field Operation”).
Under  the Sampang PSC’s joint operating agreement (“Sampang JOA”), both  Cue Sampang Pty.
(“Cue”) and Singapore Petroleum Company  Limited (“SPC”) retained the right to back-in to any sole-risk discovery  based on a contractually calculated penalty formula.
On April 29, 2005,  SPC and Cue notified the Company of their intention to reinstate their  interest in the Jeruk Field under the terms of the Sampang JOA.
As a  result, the Company is required to return its 50% interest in the Jeruk  Field Operation for compensation based on the penalty formula in the  Sampang JOA.
This will include immediate repayment of the Company’s  expenditures of USD 30.4 million.
Subsequently, the Company has been  asked by SPC and Cue to farm in 25% of Jeruk Field for an amount of  USD 21 million in which the Company has accepted.
Divestment of Apexindo  On September 28, 2005, PT Apexindo Pratama Duta (“Apexindo”)   completed its Rights Issue process that has resulted in the issuance of  837.6 million new shares with proceeds of IDR 460.68 billion.
Along  with this right issue, in which the Company did not exercise, Apexindo  noted the entrance of Sea Drill Limited, Inc.
– a European-based Drilling  Company listed in Oslo Stock Exchange – as a shareholder with 32.30%  of ownership.
Consequently, MedcoEnergi’s ownership in Apexindo was  reduced from 77.5% to 52.38%.
The Company did not receive any cash  from the above mentioned transaction.
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUES Net Oil and Gas Sales The Company’s revenues from net sales of crude oil and natural gas are  affected primarily by its net entitlement volume of oil and gas under  production sharing arrangements and the prices at which they are sold.
Net entitlement consists of the Company’s (i) cost recovery and (ii) profit  share, net of its Domestic Market Obligation (DMO).
The Company sells its net crude oil entitlement through a competitive  tender processes, subject to market conditions, and enters into short- term sales contracts with the winning bidders.
Crude oil entitlement  not sold pursuant to a sales contract can readily be sold in the spot  market, albeit without the modest premium afforded by a sales contract.
A major portion of the Company’s net crude entitlement in 2005 was  sold to Itochu Petroleum Co.
(“Itochu”), PTT Public Company  Limited, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.
MedcoEnergi Annual Report 2005 127 Financial Performance and ReportThe Company currently sells most of its oil at prices based on the  ICP-SLC, and is subject to adjustments depending on the quality of  the crude oil.
The cost recovery portion of net crude entitlement is  also calculated based upon ICP prices.
The monthly ICP-SLC is derived  from the average of the mean of three publications of independent  oil traders and marketers in the Asia-Pacific region, namely the Asian  Petroleum Price Index (“APPI”) that publishes the data twice a week,  RIM Intelligence Co.
(“RIM”) with daily publication, and Platts (“Platts”),  in the following proportions: 20% APPI, 40% RIM and 40% Platts.
The ICP-SLC is published by Pertamina every month.
An exception is  made for the Company’s sales of oil from the Tuban block whereby the  sales refers to the ICP-Arjuna, a similar indicator published monthly.
The Company’s average realized sales price for oil for the years ended  December 31, 2005 and 2004 were USD 53.68 and USD 36.93 per  bbls, respectively.
Currently, the majority of the Company’s net crude  entitlement is exported to Itochu and the remainder is supplied to  Pertamina’s domestic refinery.
On the other hand, gas sales contracts are typically long-term fixed price  contracts.
The Company’s average realized sales price for gas per mmbtu  for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were USD 2.45 and  USD 2.26, respectively.
As most of the natural gas produced by the  Company is from gas fields which were discovered while developing oil  fields, the costs of developing and operating its gas fields are relatively  low by industry standards.
The Company’s total sales and other operating revenues increased  by USD 70.0 million, or 12.7%, to USD 620.2 million in 2005 from   USD 550.1 million in 2004.
The increase was primarily due to the  increase of net oil and gas sales and revenues from other contracts, as  well as electric power sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in  revenues from drilling operations and other related services; and net  methanol sales.
Revenues from net oil and gas sales increased by USD 65.0 million,  or 17.7%, to USD 432.4 million in 2005 from USD 367.4 million in  2004.
The increase in revenue from net oil and gas sales was primarily  due to the higher average realized sales prices for both oil and gas in  2005 compared to 2004.
The Company’s average realized sales prices  for oil and condensate increased to USD 53.68 per bbls in 2005 from   USD 36.93 per bbls in 2004, which was partially offset by a decrease in  the Company’s total oil lifting from 57.5 mbpod in 2004 to 53.3 mbopd  in 2005.
Meanwhile, the Company also benefited from the increase in  average realized prices of gas to USD 2.45 per mmbtu in 2005 from   USD 2.54 per mmbtu in 2004.
Nevertheless, the volume of total gas sales  decreased to 132.2 mmcfd in 2005 from 192.4 mmcfd in 2004.
Revenues from Drilling Operations and Related Services The Company’s revenues from drilling operations and related services  vary based upon demand for its drilling and related services (such as  mobilization and demobilization fees), which in turn affects the number  of days that the rig fleet is utilized and the aggregate day rates received  by the Company.
Demand for drilling rigs is affected by a number of  factors, including the demand for oil and natural gas products, the level  of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and general  worldwide economic and market conditions.
(S) Pte Ltd (“Itochu”), PTT Public Company Limited,  Mitsui Oil Exploration Co.
MedcoEnergi  Laporan Tahunan 2005 128 Laporan dan Kinerja KeuanganRevenues from drilling operations are recognized as work is performed.
When mobilization or rig enhancement is required for a contract,  MedcoEnergi may receive a lump-sum payment to offset all or a  portion of the cost.
When an offshore rig is moved from one location  to another under a contract, mobilization revenues and costs incurred  are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract.
If a rig is  moved without a contract, all costs incurred are immediately charged  against income.
Payments received for rig enhancements are recognized  as Revenues over the term of the related drilling contract.
Revenues from  drilling operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the  timing of contract completions, mobilizations, scheduled maintenance  and the weather.
Revenues from drilling operations and related services decreased by   USD 5.4 million, or 5.7%, to USD 89.0 million in 2005 from USD 94.4  million in 2004, primarily due to the decrease in onshore rig utilization  rates from 53% in 2004 to 51% in 2005 and higher related parties  transactions.
Such related parties transactions has caused the revenues  from drilling operations and related services in 2005 to decrease  although the average daily revenue for both onshore and offshore rigs  in 2005 was higher than that of 2004.
The average daily revenues for  onshore rigs was USD 8,689 in 2005, compared to USD 8,133 in 2004.
While the average daily revenues for offshore rigs was USD 48,242 in  2005, compared to USD 44,774 in 2004.
Net Methanol Sales The Company derives revenues from the sales of methanol produced  from the Bunyu Methanol Plant and the operatorship of the plant which  is leased from Pertamina.
Revenues from net methanol sales are affected  by production volume and the prices at which the Company can sell its  methanol, which in turn are dependent upon worldwide demand and  supply of methanol.
Net methanol sales decreased by USD 10.5 million, or 19.0%, to   USD 45.0 million in 2005 from USD 55.5 million in 2004.
This is largely  attributable to lower methanol sales which was 198.7 thousand mt in  2005 from 236.6 thousand mt in 2004, as the Company experienced  a decreased supply of gas.
Furthermore, methanol prices decreased to  USD 225 per mt in 2005 from USD 230 per mt in 2004.
Share of Profit of Joint Ventures Revenues from the share of profit of joint ventures represent the  Company’s proportionate net income primarily derived from Kakap,  Brantas and Tuban blocks as well as the recently partial divestment of  Kakap (2.75%) and full divestment of Stratton, Bukha, Padre Island  blocks and asset in Pakistan, all of which are not operated by the  Company.
Revenues from share of profits of joint ventures was relatively stable, at  USD 19.8 million this year, compared to USD 19.7 million last year.
In  2004, the share of profits of joint ventures came from Novus Australia,  Novus Pakistan, Kakap, Brantas, Tuban and Jeruk.
The working interest  of Kakap and Brantas in 2004 were 25% and 50%, respectively with  contribution for 6 months since was acquired Novus in June 2004.
For  the year ended December 31, 2005, the share of profits of joint ventures  consisted only of Kakap, Brantas and Tuban with working interest 16%,  32% and 25%, respectively contributing on full year basis.
MedcoEnergi Annual Report 2005 129 Financial Performance and ReportElectric Power Sales  MedcoEnergi sells its electricity generated by its subsidiary, PT Mitra  Energy Batam (MEB) to the State Electricity Company (PLN).
Pursuant  the Power Purchase Agreement dated July 14, 2004 between PT PLN  Batam and MEB, PT PLN Batam agreed to purchase the electricity from  MEB’s power plant for a minimum of 408,391,200 kilowatt-hour per  year at the price of Rp 190 per kilowatt-hour for 12 years starting from  the commercial operation date of October 29, 2004.
On June 9, 2005, the Company, through the Consortium Fortum  Service Oy – PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk (Medco-Fortum), a  consortium established by virtue of an agreement dated October 9, 2004  (Operator), entered into an Operation and Maintenance Agreement  (O&M Agreement) with PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
Under this  O&M Agreement, Medco-Fortum Consortium was appointed as the  operator for the 2x660 MW coal-fired power station at Tanjung Jati,  East Java for a period of 24 (twenty four) years.
The Company – through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PT Medco Power  Indonesia – also holds 40% interest in PT Dalle Energy Batam, which  is the owner and operator of the second phase of a 55.5 MW power  plant located in Panaran Batam (Batam Power Plant Phase II).
Under  the Power Purchase Agreement (Phase II Power Purchase Agreement),  dated January 2, 2005, between PT PLN Batam and PT Dalle Energy  (which assigned the Power Purchase Agreement to PT Dalle Energy  Batam on May 20, 2005), PT PLN Batam will purchase the electricity  from the Batam Power Plant Phase II for a minimum of 371,424,000  kilowatt-hour per year at the price of Rp 439 per kilowatt-hour for 12  years starting from the commercial operation date.
During the year, the Company recorded Revenues of USD 8.2 million  from electric power sales as its PLTG Panaran-1 has fully operated.
Meanwhile, the 3-month operation in 2004 has generated Revenues  of  USD 1.5 million.
Revenues from Other Contracts Revenues from other contracts are recognized when earned and  primarily represent from back charges related to the Company’s drilling  operations, comprising spare parts, supplies, fuel and catering for the  Company’s drilling clients for which the Company bills its customers  and revenues from O&M Services.
Revenues from other contracts increased significantly, to USD 25.8  million in 2005 from USD 11.6 million in 2004, due to back charges  and the commencement of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement  for Tanjung Jati B Power Plant.
EXPENSES Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs Exploration and production (E&P) direct costs mainly comprise of  production and lifting costs, exploration expenses, depreciation, and  amortization expenses.
Production and lifting costs consist primarily  of salaries, wages and employees’ benefit, materials and supplies, and  contract charges.
The factors affecting production and lifting costs are  field operations overhead, operations and maintenance, pipeline and  transportation fees and operational supports.
MedcoEnergi  Laporan Tahunan 2005 130 Laporan dan Kinerja KeuanganExploration expenses vary with the level of exploration activities and  the success rate of such activities.
Depreciation and amortization are  caused by the depletion of capitalized oil and gas exploration and  development costs using the unit of production method, except for the  support facilities and equipment are calculated using the straight line  method over 4 to 20 years.
For the year 2005, MedcoEnergi’s lifting costs  and 3-year average finding and development costs was approximately   USD 2.76/bbl and  USD 1.37 per boe.
The low 3-year average finding and  development costs in 2005 was caused by the Senoro-Toili gas reserves  which was recorded as Proved reserves.
The Company believes that its  cost structure allows it to compete effectively even in a low crude oil  price environment.
The Company’s E&P direct costs increased by USD 2.41 million, or  1.6%, to USD 154.0 million in 2005 from USD 151.6 million in 2004.
The increase in E&P direct costs was caused by increases in depreciation  and amortization which was partially offset by a decrease in production  and lifting expenses, as well as exploration expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization arise from the depletion of capitalized oil  and gas exploration and development costs which are calculated using  the unit of production method, except for the support facilities and  equipment are calculated using the straight line method over 4 to 20  years starting in 2005 with the effect of the change, being immaterial,  was charged to current operations, as well as depreciation of property  and equipment in drilling, methanol and electric power operations which  are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful  lives of the assets.
Prior to 2002, the Company calculated depreciation  and amortization using internal reserve estimates which varied from  GCA’s reserve estimates.
Beginning in 2002, the Company calculated  depreciation and amortization using GCA’s reserve estimates where  available.
The Company’s adoption of GCA’s reserve data beginning  in 2002 and the resulting decrease in the Company’s proven reserves  caused an increase in the Company’s depreciation and amortization  expense.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization increased by USD 12.9  million, or 17,2%, to USD 87.5 million in 2005 from USD 74.6 million  in 2004, primarily attributable to the addition of oil and gas properties  from existing assets, after taking into account GCA report dated January  1, 2006, i.
In addition,  the Company’s Sembakung block has started to recognize depreciation  expenses in 2005, which amounted to USD 4.0 million.
Drilling Operations Costs Drilling operations costs consist primarily of salaries and wages, labor  contracts, repairs and maintenance, rental expense of drilling equipment,  catering and insurance expenses.
If a rig is moved without a contract, all  costs incurred are immediately recognized as drilling operations costs.
Drilling operations costs are not affected by changes in dayrates.
In  addition, such expenses are not, in the short term, generally affected by  fluctuations in utilization.
For instance, if a rig is idle for a short period of  time, the Company realizes slight decrease in expenses as rigs typically  are maintained in a ready-to-operate state with a full crew complement.
However, if a rig were expected to be idle for a longer period of time  (generally more than one month but not more than six months), the  Company attempts to decrease expenses by reducing the size of the  rig’s crew and takes steps to maintain the rig in an idle “hotstacked”  mode, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the negative impact  on operating income associated with loss of revenues.
If the idle time is more than six months,  the Company attempts to decrease expenses further by taking steps to  maintain the rig in an idle “coldstacked” mode and reducing contract  laborers and only maintains the stack cost around USD 1,000/day for  the permanent staff.
Cost of sales and direct expenses may also be impacted by the Company’s  ability to successfully hire and train sufficient numbers of employees to  operate the Company’s drilling equipment.
The Company recognizes  repairs and maintenance expenditures that maintain rather than upgrade  rigs as cost of sales and direct expenses.
The Company’s drilling operations costs decreased by USD 4.4 million,  or 6.1%, to USD 68.2 million in 2005 from USD 72.6 million in 2004.
The decrease in drilling operations costs were caused by decreases in  onshore rig average daily cost to USD 7,142 in 2005 from USD 7,950 in  2004 and offshore rig average daily cost to USD 19,952 in 2005 from  USD 20,049 in 2004.
Furthermore, the Company’s onshore rigs recorded  lower utilization rate to 51% in 2005 from 53% in 2004.
Production and Lifting Costs Production and lifting costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and  employee benefits, materials and supplies and contract charges.
These  costs are mainly affected by the level of production, field operation  overhead, operations and maintenance costs, operations support and  pipeline fees.
The Company’s production and lifting costs decreased slightly by USD  3.2 million, or 4.1%, to USD 74.6 million in 2005 from USD 77.8 million  in 2004, primarily due to the divestment of several international assets  during 2005.
Cost of Methanol Sales Pursuant to a 20-year agreement entered into with Pertamina in April  1997, the Company began operating a methanol plant owned by  Pertamina on Bunyu Island, east of Kalimantan through its subsidiary,   PT Medco Methanol Bunyu (“MMB”).
As compensation, since May 2003,  the Company has been paying Pertamina a fixed rental fee of USD 2.2  million per annum, which is subject to review every two years, while  the non-fixed rental fee in US Dollar is determined based on evaluation  of the methanol standard price by the international market.
The other  components of the cost of methanol sales are feed gas costs, refinery  plant operational costs, salaries and other allowances, contract labor,  fuel consumption and material used.
The Company’s cost of methanol sales slightly decreased by USD 10.4  million, or 24.4%, to USD 32.3 million in 2005 from USD 42.7 million  in 2004.
This was primarily because of declining methanol production  as the Company received limited amount of gas supply from Tarakan  block.
Methanol production in 2005 was 198,689 mt, compared to  2004 figure of 236,574 mt.
Exploration Expenses Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, geological and geophysical  costs and exploration overhead.
The Company’s exploration expenses  decreased by USD 4.8 million, or 20.1%, to USD 19.0 million in 2005  from USD 23.9 million in 2004.
This was mainly due to lower dry hole  costs of USD 8.6 million in 2005 compared to USD 13.4 million in  2004.
MedcoEnergi  Laporan Tahunan 2005 132 Laporan dan Kinerja KeuanganCost of Crude Oil Purchase This accounts consists of cost crude oil purchased by the Company from  BP Migas in 2005.
The Company’s cost of crude oil purchase were USD  5.0 million and USD 4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005  and 2004, respectively.
Cost of Power Sales Cost of power sales represents expenses, such as maintenance cost and  salaries, related to the Batam power plant since the commencement of  its commercial operations on October 29, 2004.
The Company’s cost of power sales increased by USD 4.9 million or  6,650.1% to USD 4.9 million in 2005 from USD 0.1 million in 2004,  as the Company’s Power subsidiary, PT Mitra Energi Batam (MEB),  commenced its commercial operations of the Batam Power Plant on  October 29, 2004.
Operating Expenses The Company’s operating expenses increased significantly by USD 15.9  million, or 21.4%, to USD 90.1 million in 2005 from USD 74.2 million  in 2004.
The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries, bonuses  and other employee benefits in the form of cost of living adjustments and  bonuses.
The increase was also driven by the recognition of termination  expenses for MEAPL (Novus) which amounted to USD 2.0 million.
In  2005, the Company also added its provision for pension plan in the  amount of USD 4.7 million.
Other Charges — Net The Company’s other charges — net increased by USD 9.1 million, or  18.5% to USD 58.2 million in 2005, from USD 49.1 million in 2004.
The increase in other charges — net was mainly attributable to Loss on  swap transactions and rising interest expenses.
• Equity in net income (loss) of associated entities – net was USD 11.0  million in 2005, compared to USD (0.8) million in 2004, primarily  due to the commencement of commercial lifting of the Company’s  subsidiary, Medco Moeco Langsa Limited (MML) on January 6,  2005 for USD 10.6 million and net income contribution from Probe  Technology Services Inc.
for USD 0.4 million.
In 2005, the Company posted signing bonus of  USD 5.0 million as it entered into an Exploration Joint Venture  Agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum  Corporation.
No signing bonus was recorded for the year 2004.
• Gain on foreign exchange – net was USD 4.4 million in 2005,  compared to USD (6.9) million in 2004, primarily because of lower  foreign exchange rate of Rupiah to the US Dollar.
• Gain on sale of marketable securities was USD 4.3 million in 2005,  compared to USD 1.1 million in 2004.
This is mainly because of the  exercise of buyback program for IDR bonds of MedcoEnergi (parent)  and Apexindo.
• Financing charges decreased sharply by USD 9.1 million, or 89.4%,  to USD 1.1 million in 2005 from USD 10.2 million in 2004, due to  the Company’s full repayments of syndicated loan from UOB in  January 7 and July 15, 2005.
The major contributor of financing  charges are the arrangement fees and rollover fees for syndicated  loan from UOB with outstanding of principal was USD 200.0 million  for the year ended December 31, 2004.
• Gain (loss) on swap transaction.
The Company recorded a loss  on swap transaction in the amount of USD 34.7 million in 2005,  compared to a gain of USD 1.9 million recorded in 2004.
Pada 31 Desember 2004,  transaksi CCS atas obligasi Rupiah dengan mark-to-market  masih  MedcoEnergi Annual Report 2005 133 Financial Performance and Reportmark-to-market remained to cause positive impact to consolidated  income statement.
Meanwhile, as of December 31, 2005, the  CCS transactions of IDR bonds, caused negative impact regarding  mark-to-market due to lower foreign exchange rate of Rupiah to  the US Dollar which ended the year at Rp 9,830/USD, compared to   Rp 9,290/USD at the end of 2004.
• Interest expense increased by USD 10.9 million, or 28.9%, to USD  48.6 million in 2005 from USD 37.7 million in 2004, which was  mainly attributable to the full recognition of interest expenses related   to the Company’s IDR Bonds which was issued on July 12, 2004  and the new issuance of IDR Bonds from its subsidiary, Apexindo.
• Others — net was USD 1.4 million in 2005, compared to USD 3.5  million in 2004, primarily consists of Euro Bonds amortization,  recognition of income from Anadarko signature bonus and Itochu  discount amortization.
Meanwhile, the others - net for the year  ended December 31, 2004 primarily consisted of Gain on Sales of  Property and Equipment and Accounts Payable Write-off in Medco  Methanol Bunyu.
Tax Income (Expense) The Company’s tax expense increased significantly by USD 48.4 million,  or 87.7%, from USD 55.1 million in 2004 to USD 103.5 million in 2005,  mainly because of the increase in revenue from oil and gas operations,  which is under PSC.
