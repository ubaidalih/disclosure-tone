219 The Company succeeded in implementing a cost-efficiency  strategy that has proven to be effective in mitigating the  effects of declining oil price throughout the second semester  of 2014, thereby maintaining a healthy net profit.
Net Oil & Gas Sales In 2014, the Company succeeded in arresting the natural  decline of its oil and gas production to under 10%.
This  is an achievement in and of itself, when compared to  the average natural decline of oil and gas production  in the normal range of 20%-25%.
Although the global  crude oil price declined in the second semester of 2014,  MedcoEnergi achieved a realized crude oil price of  US$97.83/barrel, or just 9.67% below the realized crude oil price in 2013.
whereas for the realized price of gas  that is based on long-term sale and purchase contract  with buyers, the Company realized a 9.16% increase over  the average price of gas to US$5.60/MMBTU in 2014.
This increase reflects the success of the Company in  renegotiating the sale and purchase contracts for gas,  which helped the Company’s performance in 2014 by  mitigating the decline in the realized oil and gas sales  as a result of the natural decline rate and lower realized  oil price.
The Company booked total net sales of oil and  gas amounting to US$701.43 million in 2014, lower than US$826.84 million in 2013.

In  comparison to those of 2013, the production and sale of coal totalled 633.97 MT and 525.34 MT, respectively.
The  decline was prompted by the cost-efficiency strategy to  reduce operating cost by eliminating certain activities that  did not contribute to optimum results during a bearish  coal market.
Total revenues derived from the Company’s  operations in 2014 declined to US$36.15 million, in  comparison with US$42.96 million a year before.
Revenue from Services The Company posted revenues from services totalling  US$13.16 million in 2014, declining by US$3.56 million  from revenues in 2013, mainly as a result of the  completion of a number of contracts during the year.
However,  the Company was able to gain new contracts for drilling services that started at year end 2014 and in  2015.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin MedcoEnergi posted total consolidated cost of sales and  other direct costs of US$479.77 million in 2014, a decline  of 8.04% from US$521.73 million in 2013.
The decline reflected the success of the Company’s cost-efficiency  strategy in order to maintain net profitability.
The decline resulted in a corresponding decline  in gross profit margin to 39.13%, from 41.76% in  2013.
•	 The	coal	sector	posted	a	gross	profit	of	US$6.20	 million, from US$15.31 million in 2013.
This resulted  in a decline of gross profit margin to 17.15%, from  35.64% in 2013.
•	 The	services	sector	posted	a	decline	in	gross	profit	 to record a gross loss of US$3.46 million in 2014, compared to a gross profit of US$2.02 million in 2013.
This resulted in a decline in the gross profit margin of  5.63% to a gross profit loss of 11.05% in 2014.
Sales, General and Administration Expenses Another proof of the Company’s success in maintaining  cost efficiency was underscored by the declining sales, general and administrative expense during the year by  5.81% to US$110.31 million, from US$117.11 million in  2013.
Operating ProfitIn 2014, MedcoEnergi posted an operating profit of  US$160.64 million, a decline from US$247.69 million in  2013.
The operating profit margin in 2014 declined to 21.40% from 27.94% in 2013.
Financing Expense In line  with the Company’s cost-efficiency strategy,  a number of initiatives were taken to reduce the cost  of financing such as early repayment of several bank  borrowings that bear high interest rates.
The Company also consistently raised new financing with more  competitive costs.

The Company’s average  financing cost in 2014 was 5.3% per annum, down from  5.8% in 2013.
Laporan Kewajiban Statutory Report 222 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk Laporan Tahunan 2014  | Annual Report 2014Other Revenues (Expenses) - Net In 2014, other net revenues (expenses) decreased by  26.69% to US$20.71 million from US$28.25 million.
The  decrease was dominated by a loss on foreign exchange.
Other Comprehensive Revenues After Tax Other Comprehensive Revenues After Tax comprised of:•	 Fair	Value	Adjustment	on	Cashflow	from	Hedging	 Instruments   In 2014, there was an increase of gains made on the  Fair Value Adjustment on Cashflow from Hedging  Instruments to US$22,07 million compared to a loss  of US$40.48 million in 2013.
One of the factors that  contributed to that increase was the depreciating Rupiah against the US Dollar, falling from Rp12,189/ US$1.00 in 2013 to Rp12,440/US$1.00 in 2014.
The  Company sought to protect its cash flow by hedging  several liability instruments including Rupiah Bonds  totalling Rp4.5 trillion and bank borrowings amounting  to Rp1.4 trillion, as well as borrowings in US Dollar  amounting to US$30 million.
•	 Foreign	Currency	Translation	in	the	Financial	 Statements   Foreign currency translation in the financial statements  arises from different currency denominations in the  book of the parent company and those of subsidiary  entities.
In 2014, the translation produced a loss of  US$1.60 million from a gain of US$0.99 million in  2013, This was due to the considerable depreciation  of the Rupiah against the US Dollar in 2014.
•		 Profit	Attributable	to	Non-controlling	Interests  Profit Attributable to Minority Interests amounted to  US$3.60 million or higher by 5.88% from US$3.40  million in 2013.
•		 Profit	Attributable	to	Owner	of	the	Parent	Company  In 2014, the Company posted Profit that is Attributable  to Owner of the Parent Company amounting to  US$10.11 million, a decline of US$2.47 million compared to US$12.58 million in 2013.
As a result, the  amount of earnings per share declined to US$0.0030  from US$0.0041 in 2013.
The success of the  Company in maintaining its  Profit that is Attributable  to Owner of the Parent Company was largely  attributed to the cost efficiency policy as well as the  Company’s successful efforts to reduce the cost  of borrowings by early repayment of high interest- bearing bank borrowings.
The Company’s net profit margin in 2014 declined  to  1.35% from 1.42% in 2013.
The Company posted an increase in the value of fixed assets in 2014 that was derived from the increase in  oil and gas assets from the acquisition of the oil and  gas assets in Tunisia.
This contributed to the decline  in the return on assets by 0.13% to 0.37% in 2014.
On the other hand, the increase in the fair value  adjustment on cashflow from hedging instruments  that resulted from a weakening of the rupiah from  Rp12,189/US$1.00 in 2013 to Rp12,440/US$1.00 in  2014, contributed to a return on equity of 1.10%.
Current Assets The total current assets of MedcoEnergi declined by  8.56% as at year-end 2014 to US$751.12 million from   US$821.45 million as of year-end 2013.
The difference  of US$70.33 million was primarily due to the significant  decline of cash and cash-equivalent to US$206.64 million  by year-end 2014 from US$263.97 million as at year- end 2013, the decline in trade receivables by 29.27% to  US$101.59 million by year-end 2014 from US$143.63  million at year-end 2013, the increase in other receivables by 47.86% to US$112.29 million by year-end 2014 from  US$75.94 million at year-end 2013, the decrease in Laporan Kewajiban Statutory Report 224 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk Laporan Tahunan 2014  | Annual Report 2014investment available for sale of US$7.29 million at year- end 2014 from US$24.99 million in 2013.
The decline in total net cash was largely due to the use  of cash for the retirement of bank borrowing amounting  to US$160.86 million and the retirement of borrowings  from related parties amounting to US$134.36 million,  plus the increase of cash derived from operating activities  amounting to US$163.27 million, and less cash used in  investment and funding activities; all of which resulted in a cash and cash-equivalent balance of US$206.64 million  as at year-end 2014.

Considering that the global oil price has fallen by up  to 50% has forced the Company to undertake cost  efficiency measures in a comprehensive manner  including rescheduling exploration timetables, while  maintaining investments that directly impact an increase  in production.
The Company believes that the price of oil will not stay low over a prolonged period of time, and  that oil price will rebound to around US$70/barrel by 2016  (source: Goldman Sachs oil price projection, 11 January  2015), and as such the Company is confident that the  business of oil and gas will still remain to be the backbone  of the Company for the foreseeable future.
The Company also believes that its business will have  a certainty factor that is adequate and assured of its Analisis dan Pembahasan Manajemen Management’s Discussion and Analysis 235 terjamin kelangsungannya selama tahun 2015.

They are expected to be the future  backbone of the Company and ensure its sustainable  long-term growth in 2015 and beyond.
The Company will continue to seek for growth  opportunities through the acquisition of producing oil and  gas assets, especially in the regions of the Middle East,  North Africa and Asia Pacific.
In addition, the Company  will also strive to obtain service contracts to operate oil  and gas fields in the Company’s current operating areas or  in new areas altogether.
