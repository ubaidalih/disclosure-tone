171 Statutory Report 2013  Annual Report | PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk Management's Discussion  and AnalysisA positive aspect in the achievements of the Company during  that year was that it also managed to arrest the decline in the oil reserves of aging fields to a level of below 10% compared to the normal average rate of decline of 20-25%.
MedcoEnergi’s commitment to maintain a stable operating performance in 2013  was evident from the EBITDA of the Company for the year, which was stable at a range of US$340-350 million.
Efforts to reduce interest expenses on funding proved to be effective, as shown by the significant decline in funding expenses during the year.
In addition, the cost efficiency program undertaken by the Company also yielded positive results as general and administrative expenses declined during the year.
Another positive aspect for the year under review was the success of MedcoEnergi to arrest the decline in the oil reserves of aging fields to a level of below 10%, compared to the normal average rate of decline of 20-25%.
Net Oil & Gas Sales In 2013, MedcoEnergi posted a total of US$826.84 million in oil-and gas sales, a decline of 5.29% from US$873.03 million in 2012.
The decline was due to a lower realized oil price of US$108.26/barrel in 2013 compared to US$115.89 barrel in 2012.
The Company’s commitment to maintain the level of its revenues was underscored by its successful negotiations to improve the price on several gas sales contract in 2013, which increased the realized average selling price of gas in 2013 to US$5.41/MMBTU compared to US$4.03/MMBTU in 2012.

The increase was due to PT Duta Tambang Raya’s success in achieving optimum production capacity, resulting in the increase of sales volume in 2013 to 525,342 MT from 132,035 MT in 2012.
Revenue from Services The Company posted revenues from services totalling US$16.72 million in 2013, a decline of 6.29% from US$17 .84 in 2012.
In 2013, the segment actually posted higher sales.
However, since the increase was obtained from drilling services across the same business line of the Company, it was not included in the consolidated profit-and-loss statements of the Company.
Sales Revenue from Chemicals and Other  Petroleum Products The Company posted total sales from chemicals  and other petroleum products of US$2.43 million in 2013, a decline of 45.14% from US$4.42 million in 2012.
The decline was due to the divestment of PT Medco Sarana Kalibaru that the Company undertook in 2012, which had been the largest revenue contributor to the segment.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in deprecation cost during the year as a result of the Company’s declining oil and gas reserves due to production, without the discoveries of new oil and gas reserves as their replacements.
The success of PT Duta Tambang Rekayasa in  achieving optimum production in 2013, contributed significantly to the Company’s Gross Profit for the year.
All the Company achieved a gross profit of US$367 .22 million in 2013, lower by 8.64% from US$401 .94 million in 2012.
The decrease in gross profit in 2013 brought a corresponding decrease in the Company's gross profit margin to 41 .31% from 44.44% in 2012.
The oil and gas segment posted a decrease in  gross profit to US$336.79 million from US$387 .20 million in 2012.
This translated into a slight decrease in gross profit margin to 41 .76% from 41 .85% in 2012.
The chemical and other petroleum products segment posted a decrease in sales to US$8.32 million from US$203.56 million in 2012.
The decrease resulted from the divestment of PT Medco Sarana Kalibaru that was completed in 2012.
This contributed to a decline in gross profit margin to minus 2.76% from 0.41% in 2012.
The services segment posted an increase in total  sales to US$35.93 million from US$26.16 million in 2012.
On the sales expense side there was an equally significant increase.
The largest increase was due to the large depreciation expense as a result of asset acquisition by the Company in 2012.
As a result of this, gross profit declined from US$5.14 million in 2012 to US$2.02 million in 2013.
This contributed to a decline in gross profit margin to 5.63% from 19.66% in 2012.

The increase was due to the success of the Company in achieving optimum production capacity in 2013.
This resulted in an increase of gross profit to US$15.31 million from US$0.65 million in 2012.
The success contributed to the increase in gross profit margin to 35.64%, from 7 .18% in 2012.
Operating Profit MedcoEnergi posted an operating profit of US$245.73 million in 2013, a decline of 5.61% from US$260.35 million in 2012.
As a result, operating profit margin in 2013 decreased to 27 .64% compared to 28.79% in 2012.
Sales, General and Administration Expenses The Company’s commitment to maintain cost efficiency in 2013 was underscored by its success in reducing sales, general and administrative expense during the year by 14.20% to US$121 .49 million from US$141 .59 million in 2012.
Financing Expense The Company succeeded in reducing financing expense to US$77 .08 million from US$95.35 million in 2012.
The Company successfully executed a cross currency interest rate swap on its Rupiah denominated bonds that were issued in 2013 and retired borrowings with high interest rates.
These efforts resulted in a significant reduction of the Company’s interest expense in 2013 compared to that of 2012.

The increase was dominated by gains made on foreign currency translation as well as from the restitution of value-added tax provision from Subsidiary Entities that are engaged in the oil and gas sector.
Other Comprehensive Revenues After Tax Other Comprehensive Revenues After Tax comprised of: •	 Fair	Value	Adjustment	on	Cashflow	from	 Hedging Instruments   In 2013, there was an increase of loss from  the Fair Value Adjustment on Cashflow from Hedging Instruments to US$40.48 million from US$13.24 million in 2012.
One of the factors that contributed to that increase was the depreciating Rupiah against the US Dollar, falling from Rp9,6790 to Rp12,189 to the US Dollar in 2013.
The Company sought to protect its cash flow by hedging several liability instruments including Rupiah Bonds totalling Rp3.5 trillion and bank borrowings amounting to Rp1 .4 trillion.
• Foreign Currency T ranslation in the Financial Statements   Foreign currency translation in the financial statements arises from different currency denominations in the book of the parent company and those of subsidiary entities.
In 2013, the translation produced gains of US$0.99 million, compared to US$0.48 million in 2012.
This was due to the considerable depreciation of the Rupiah against the US Dollar in 2013.
•		 Profit	 Attributable	to	Minority	Interests  Profit Attributable to Minority Interests decreased by 45.77% to US$3.40 million in 2013 from US$6.26 million in 2012.
The decrease was due to lower revenue contribution from the Company's operating block in Oman that decreased the share of minority interests from the operating block.
Other expenses of the Company rose by 50.29% to US$13.65 million from US$9.08 million in 2012, whereby the increase was mainly incurred from the cost of the adjustment of fair value from a hedging transaction by the Company, and provisioning for uncollected receivables in 2013.
Other Expense 05101520 9.0813.65(million US$) Other Income 0102030405060 25.3249.68(million US$)  2012 20132012 2013 176 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk | 2013  Annual Report •		 Profit	 Attributable	to	Shareholders	of	the	 Parent Entity  In 2013, the Company posted Profit that is  Attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Entity was amounting to US$12.58 million, a decline of US$0.01 million compared to US$12.59 million in 2012.
As a result, the amount of earning per share declined to US$0.0041 from US$0.0043 in 2013.
The success of the Company in maintaining its  Profit that is Attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Entity was largely attributed to the cost efficiency policy as well as the Company’s successful efforts to reduce the cost of borrowings by entering into a cross currency interest rate swap on several of its Rupiah denominated bonds and the retirement of high interest-bearing bank borrowings.
The Company’s net profit margin in 2013 rose to 1 .42% from 1 .39% in 2012.
This was because the decline in sales, general and administrative expense as well as the decline in borrowing expense were able to offset the decline in the Company’s total sales, resulting in the slight increase of the Company’s net profit margin in 2013 compared to that of the previous year.
In terms of return on assets, there was a slight increase to 0.50% from 0.47% in 2012.
The increase was triggered by the decrease in the Company’s total fixed assets that transpired in 2013 largely due to the fair value adjustments made on the assets of PT Medco Ethanol Lampung; whereas in terms of return on equity, there was a slight decrease to 1 .40% from 1 .49% in 2012.
The decrease was largely due  to the sale of the Company’s treasury stock in 2013 that contributed to the increase in the amount of paid-in capital by 68.87%.

The difference of US$323.21 million was primarily due to the significant decline of cash and cash-equivalent to US$263.97 million by year-end 2013 from US$525.65 million as of year-end 2012.
The trade receivables declined by 2.38% to US$143.63 million by year-end 2013 from US$147 .13 million as of year-end 2012 and the decline of other receivables was by 4.06% to US$75.94 million by year-end 2013 from US$79.16 million as of year-end 2012.

The increase in investment available for sales was amounting to US$24.99 million as at year-end 2013.
The decline in total net cash was largely due to the  use of cash for the retirement of bank borrowing amounting to US$421 .51 million and the retirement of other long-term debts amounting to US$41 .45 million, plus the increase of cash derived from operating activities amounting to US$209.44 million.

However, there was an increase in derivatives liability of US$144.15 million. 183 Statutory Report 2013  Annual Report | PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk (n US$) Description 2013 Contribution  (%)2012 Contribution  (%)∆ (%) Long-term debt - net of current maturities  889,993,298 72.66  1,186,996,294  85.99  (25.02) Other payables  9,698,707 0.79  13,849,625  1 .00  (29.97) Deferred tax liabilities - net  99,150,300 8.09  90,167 ,043  6.53  9.96  Post-employment benefits liabilities  13,065,752 1 .07  15,769,959  1 .14  (17 .15) Derivative liabilities  162,135,400 13.24  17 ,985,673  1 .30  801 .47  Asset abandonment and site restoration obligation  and other provisions 50,825,708 4.15  55,675,546  4.03  (8.71) T otal  1,224,869,165 100.00  1,380,444,140  100.00  (11.27)Composition of Long-term Liabilities Equity Shareholders' equity increased by 6.35%, or  US$53.33 million, from US$843.22 million in 2012 to US$896.76 million in 2013.
In addition to the increase in retained earnings that was derived from the Company’s net profit in 2013, the increase in shareholders’ equity was driven by the sale of treasury stock in 2013.
This resulted in an increase of the amount of paid-in capital by 68.87% or US$53.33 million.
The increase is accompanied by the recognition of the fair value adjustment in the hedging instrument on cash flow amounting to US$40.48 million.
All of which contributed to a net effect of the increase in total shareholders’ equity in 2013.
Cash Flow The Company's cash and cash-equivalent in 2013 declined by 49.59%, or US$259.68 million.
This was primarily due to the financing on the acquisition of PT Api Metra Graha amounting to US$100.29 million, additional oil and gas assets of US$67 .13 million, and the short-term investment placement by the Company of US$115 million in 2013.
Whereas virtually all of the cash inflows from operating activities were used to repay the Company’s debts that became due in 2013.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities The Company's cash flow from operating activities increased by 25.21%, or US$52.70 million, which primarily came from a decrease in the amount of cash payments to suppliers and employees in 2013 due to the business termination of PT Medco Sarana Kalibaru in 2012 and lower income tax payment as a result of the decline in the Company’s sales of oil and gas in 2013.
The increase was also contributed by the increasing production of PT Duta Tambang Rekayasa.
Cash Flow from Investment Activities The Company's cash flow that was used for investment activities in 2013 amounted to US$289.33 million, which was primarily due to additional short-term investments, additional oil and gas assets and exploration and evaluation assets, as well as the acquisition of PT Api Metra Graha.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company's cash flow that was used for financing activities in 2013 amounted to US$226.82 million.
During the year under review, the Company took out a bank borrowing amounting to US$110.00 million, other debts in the form of bonds amounting to US$123.06 million, and an additional debt from  184 PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk | 2013  Annual Report an affiliated party of US$5.21 million.

Material Information and Facts Subsequent to  Date of Financial Statements There are no material information and facts  subsequent to the date of financial statements.
Business Prospects Currently the Company’s strategy has remained to be an energy company, with a focus on the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.
Management believes that global crude oil price  in the future will not fall below US$90/barrel (source: projection of the price of ICE Brent oil from Bloomberg dated 15 November 2013), as such Management is confident that the business of oil and gas will still remain to be the backbone of the Company for the foreseeable future.
Management also believes that the Company's  business will have a certainty factor that is adequate and assured of its continuity in 2014.
This is underlined further by the significant progress that the Company continues to make in its Major Projects that are expected to be the future backbone of the Company and ensure its sustainable long-term growth.
The above capital structure shows a debt-to-equity ratio that declined by 0.45 from 1 .60 to 1 .15.
The decline was primarily due to the repayment of bank borrowings by the  Company.
Liquidity As of year-end 2013, the Company had very sound liquidity strength.
This was evident from the current ratio of the Company that stood at 2.00.
Cash and cash-equivalent amounted to US$263.97 million, while total short-term bank borrowings and long-term borrowings that became due in one year, had a combined amount of US$141 .70 million.
Management Policy on Capital Structure The Company had set its policy on capital structure by maintaining debt ratio (not to exceed) the financial covenant that was set in the debt agreement on the issuance of the Company's Rupiah Bonds in 2009, which is a debt-to-equity ratio of (and not to exceed) 2.50x, and in covenants over other debt instruments or liabilities of (and not to exceed) 3.00x.
Out of a total liability of US$1,634,923,055, a total of US$ 1,031,689,915 is interest expense such that the ratio of liability to equity as of 31 December 2013 was 1 .17x, or well below the stipulated financial covenants.

Management's Discussion and Analysis 187 Statutory Report 2013  Annual Report | PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk The Company shall continue to seek for growth  opportunities through the acquisition of producing oil and gas assets, especially in the regions of the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Pacific.
In addition, the Company will also strive to obtain service contracts to operate oil and gas fields in the Company's current operating areas or in new areas altogether.
Marketing Strategy Natural Gas Marketing StrategyThe Company seeks to maximize monetization of gas assets through high quality gas buyers and the renegotiation of the price of gas in existing gas sales contracts.
In the future, the Company will closely follow market opportunities to maximize monetization of gas fields with due consideration for the condition of market fundamentals, the scale of economies of the gas assets and public policy.
Market Share In line with the program of the government of Indonesia to increase the national gas production, MedcoEnergi continues to strive in intensifying its operations and development of gas fields in Indonesia.
Throughout 2013, MedcoEnergi supplied gas to various customers that include the power sector, fertilizer, transportation and household (city gas), at a total volume of 58.4 TBTU.
This volume increased slightly from 55.8 TBTU in 2012.
The increase in sales volume was complemented  with the success of MedcoEnergi in re-negotiating the selling price of gas.
The weighted average selling price of gas in 2013 reached US$5.4/MMBTU, an increase of 35% compared to the average selling price in 2012, which was US$4.0/MMBTU.
The increasing trend of the average selling price of gas over the past four years is presented in the following chart.
The price spike in gas price in 2013 was due to a number of factors, including: i.
The full realization of the gas price increase  that was agreed upon at the end of 2012, and despite the fact that the new gas price took effect towards the end of 2012, the full impact of the increase was only felt in 2013.
As reported in the previous annual report, the Company was able to increase the selling price of gas through a number of contract amendments with several customers, including PLN Borang, PGN and Mitra Energi Buana.
In the amended new contracts, the price of gas was raised from US$3.4-4.8/MMBTU to around US$6.0-6.9/MMBTU.
Implementing the new price structure in early 2013.

ICP represents a benchmark price for Indonesian crude oil that is calculated by using the formula of 50% from Indonesian crude oil price quoted by Platt’s Singapore, and the other 50% from the quote of RIM Japan that is based on the price of Brent crude.
In line with the domestic benchmark, sales of crude oil from the international fields follows the Brent crude price.
The following is the Brent price trend, and that of  ICP SLC that represents the benchmark price for the large majority of MedcoEnergi’s crude oil.
Management's Discussion and Analysis 189 Statutory Report 2013  Annual Report | PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk In 2013, Medco succeeded in implementing a  strategy for the sales of crude oil by maximizing production, tenor of contract, and gauging the demand of customers.
As a result, Medco was able to quote a premium, in which the realized selling price is set above the ICP price.
In the future, MedcoEnergi will continue to apply this strategy in order to add value and contribute to the continuing growth of the Company.
