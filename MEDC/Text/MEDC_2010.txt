MedcoEnergi is presently engaged in six business segments: 1.
Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas; 2.
Other contracts and related services; 3.
Chemicals or Downstream; 4.
Electric Power Generation;  5.
Trading; and 6.
Funding for MedcoEnergi Group operations.
The Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas business include activities in Indonesia and International.
The businesses of other contracts and related services include  activities in:  • Providing Services to Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas in the Sultanate of Oman; • Providing Supporting Services for the Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas; • Gas Distribution; • Exploration and Production of Coal Bed Methane; and  • Coal Mining.
In order to obtain information on the performance of each segment the followings are operating performance review of each segment which contributed to the Company’s sales and revenues. 1.
Oil and Gas E&P In 2010 and 2009, the oil and gas operation remains as the main  focus of MedcoEnergi’s business.
It also stays as the largest  contributor to MedcoEnergi’s 2010 and 2009 sales and operating  revenues.
In Indonesia, MedcoEnergi’s oil and gas activities focus on  upstream activity, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas.
Meanwhile, MedcoEnergi’s International oil  and gas activities cover exploration, development and production  of crude oil and natural gas, as well as providing management and operation of oil and gas producing field services.
Production and Sales Volume  In 2010 and 2009, MedcoEnergi’s oil and gas production was  generated from the Indonesian and United States of America operation.
Production Total oil and gas production in 2010 reached 20,890.46 MBOE, an  increase of 8.1% from 19,318.40 MBOE in 2009.
Total production  from Indonesia in 2010 were 20,358 MBOE, and from USA were 532.46 MBOE, up 6.9% and 91.9%, respectively, from 19,041 MBOE  and 277.40 MBOE in 2009.
The increase of gas production from S&CS working area and the  onstream of Singa gas field production, as well as the reactivation  of Sea Robin pipeline in East Cameron were the main attributes  to the increase of total production in 2010.
Higher gas production volumes were offset by natural decline of oil production volumes  from Rimau working area in Indonesia.
Crude Oil Sales In Indonesia, the Company sold its crude oil entitlement to potential offtakers through a limited open tender.
Meanwhile in USA, the  Company sells its oil and gas production under fee-based, short- term crude and gas marketing arrangements with third party at spot market prices determined daily at the point of delivery.
Marketing  arrangements are for estimated daily volumes and are typically for  one year in duration unless terminated by either party with 30 days  written notice.
Berikut ini kontrak dan volume penjualan minyak mentah Perseroan  pada 2010 dan 2009: In 2010, a lower crude oil production from Indonesia reduced daily average sales volume to 30,454 BOPD from 34,738 BOPD in  2009.
Meanwhile, the reactivation of Sea Robin pipeline in 2010  improved the average sale volumes to 307.59 BOPD from 248.03 BOPD in 2009.
Therefore, the total average crude oil sales in 2010 declined by  12.08% to 30,761.21 BOPD from 34,986.03 BOPD in 2009.
The followings are the contracts and volume of crude oil sold in  2010 and 2009: No.
Natural Gas Sales In line with higher volume of gas production resulting from the  increase of gas production from S&CS and the onstream of Singa  field in Indonesia, the average gas sales in 2010 also increased by 46.0% to 148.36 MMCFD from 101.61 MMCFD in 2009.
The reactivation of Sea Robin pipeline also increased the USA gas  sale volumes of 6.91 MMCFD from 3.07 MMCFD in 2009. 134Laporan Tahunan MedcoEnergi 2010 No.
The volume of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) sales to PT Pertamina (Persero) declined to 42.03 tonnes per day in 2010 from 45.24  tonnes per day in 2009.
The decline in crude oil production from  Rimau Block resulted the decline of associated gas valume processed in the LPG Plant.
Consequently, high gas sales volume in Indonesia and USA caused  a significant increase of the Company’s gas sales volume in 2010 by  48.32% to 155.27 MMCFD compared to 104.68 MMCFD last year.
Berikut ini harga rata-rata minyak mentah dan gas alam Perseroan  yang terealisasi di Indonesia, AS dan Oman di tahun 2010 dan  2009: Enhancement of E&P Services in Oman In the efforts to enhance production of the Karim Field Clusters  in the Sultanate of Oman, MedcoEnergi managed to continuously  improve the oil production to 3.4 MBO in 2010, an increased by 0.1 MBO or 3.9% compared to 3.3 MBO during 2009.
However, due to  the nature of the contract, whereas MedcoEnergi is only providing  exploration and production services, the production from Karim Field Clusters will not be booked as the Company’s production.
Average Price of Oil & Gas MedcoEnergi recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil and  natural gas based upon shipment to offtakers.
Meanwhile, the total amount paid for the exploration and production services contract  provided to Karim Fields Clusters is calculated based on the total  numbers of production and the sales price of crude oil.
Therefore, the Company’s oil and gas sales are highly dependent on the global  oil price.
To determine the sales price of oil from Karim fields Clusters, the  price reference used is Dubai Merchantile Exchange Oman Crude  (DME-OQD).
The Company uses Indonesian Crude Price (ICP)- Sweet Light Crude  (SLC) set by the Department of Energy and Mining Resources as a reference in determining the price of oil sales in Indonesia.
The  ICP-SLC price is subjected to global oil price.
The Company uses the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil  price index and Henry Hub natural gas price index as references of its oil and gas production from US.
In 2010, the ICP-SLC reached an average price of US$81.44/barrel.
As a result, the realized average selling price of the Company’s  crude oil increased to US$81.41/barrel in 2010 from US$64.02/ barrel in 2009.
Meanwhile the average realized selling price for the Company’s natural gas in 2010 increased by 16.4% to US$3.62/ MMBTU compared to US$3.11/MMBTU in 2009, due to an increase  in the gas price of several sales contracts.
In 2010, the average realized crude oil price and natural gas price  in USA were US$74.30 per barrel and US$4.22 per million British  thermal units (MMBTU), respectively, an increase from US$57.70 per barrel and US$3.72 per MMBTU in 2009.
In 2010, the consolidated realized price of oil and gas sales of  MedcoEnergi reached an average price of US$81.41/barrel and  US$3.62/mmbtu, respectively, compared to US$64.02/barrel and  US$3.11/mmbtu in 2009.
Net Sales of Oil and Gas & Revenue from Other Contract  In 2010, MedcoEnergi’s net sales of oil and gas were generated  from the sales of oil and gas production in Indonesia and the United  States of America.
In 2010, the total sales of crude oil and natural gas of derived  from the operation activities in Indonesia was US$549.61 million,  increased by US$89.59 million or 19.5% from US$460.02 million in  2009.
The increase was primarily due to the higher average selling price of crude oil realized and the higher natural gas sales volume  in 2010, compared to that of 2009.
In United States of America, the net oil and gas sales reached  US$19.78 million in 2010, increased by 94.1% compared to  US$10.19 million in 2009.
The increase was mainly driven by the reactivation of Sea Robin pipeline, as well as higher oil and gas  prices in 2010, compared to 2009.
The revenue from exploration and production services contract in  Oman also increased by 21.2% to US$90.29 million, compared to  US$74.48 million in 2009.
The increase in production and average realized price of crude oil were the primary cause of higher revenue  from exploration and production services contract in Oman.
In total, MedcoEnergi recorded the net sales of oil and gas  and revenues from other contract for the International oil and gas business of US$110.07 million in 2010, 30.0% higher than  US$84.67 million last year.
Cost of Goods Sold and Direct Costs of Oil and Gas  Exploration and Production, and Other Contract The costs incurred in the oil and gas activities consist of production  and lifting cost, exploration cost, and costs of crude oil purchases  and depreciation, depletion and amortization.
For the exploration and production services, the Company booked cost of other  contracts.

In December 2010, BPMIGAS granted confirmation  on such working interest transfer, therefore, the composition of  working interest ownership subsequent to the transfer becomes MEPTS-30%, TEL-20% and PT Pertamina Hulu Energi Tomori  Sulawesi-50%.
Currently, the Company is presently evaluating and has not  determined the effects of these revised standards on its  consolidated financial statements.
In the same month, the Company signed an agreement for the divestment of 100% equity of TEL to Mitsubishi Corporation  (MC) for US$260 million.
As of December 31, 2010, all the sale  conditions had been fulfilled and the divestment of TEL became effective.
The Company recognized a gain on divestment in 2010  of US$250 million.
The Company received the payment of US$260  million for such divestment in January 2011.
At the effective date of the divestments, TEL and the assets and  liabilities associated with the 20% working interest in Senoro- Toili PSC were no longer included in the Company’s consolidated  financial statements, and as a consequence, the Company proved oil and gas reserves declined by 45,376 MBOE (thousand barrel oil  equivalent) due to exclusion of the reserves associated with the  divested working interest.
In relation with the process of partner’s selection to invest in  the Donggi-Senoro Project in 2005, the Commissioners’ Panel of  Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition (KPPU) decided on January 5, 2011, that the Company, together with  its business partners, PT Pertamina (Persero) and Mitsubishi  Corporation, have allegedly violated the Articles 22 and 23 of the Law No. 5 Year 1999 concerning Prohibition on Monopolistic  Practices and Unfair Business Competition (Law No. 5/1999).
In its decision, the KPPU Commissioners’ Panel, among other  matters, imposed on the Company an administrative penalty in  the amount of Rp6 billion.
However, the Commissioners’ Panel’s decision does not nullify or stop the ongoing business consensus  and even recommends to the Government to encourage the Donggi- Senoro Project to be accomplished within the planned project time frame.
In regard to the KPPU’s decision which is not yet legally final and  binding (in kracht van gewijsde), on January 31, 2011, pursuant to  the Law No. 5/1999, the Company officially filed an objection to the  South Jakarta District Court.
As of the date of the completion of the consolidated financial statements, the investigation process for the objection to the  KPPU decision is still ongoing in the District Court.
At this stage,  management is unable to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation process.
Nevertheless, management believes that the  decision issued by the Commissioners’ Panel on the Company has  no strong legal merit, and as such, the Company has not made any provision for the litigation process.

Middle East and North Africa The Company has oil and gas exploration and production joint venture contracts in Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia, and an oil and gas  service contract in Oman.
As of the completion date of the consolidated financial statements,  the operation in Tunisia (whereby the Company is a non-operating  partner) has returned to normal, and the situations in Yemen  and Oman have not had any significant effects on the Company operations in those countries.
Due to the ongoing civil unrest in Libya, the Company has  suspended operations in that country and repatriated all of its  non-Libyan employees and their families.
As of the completion  date of these consolidated financial statements, the emergency situation is still ongoing and therefore the Company’s operations  in Libya have not resumed.
As of December 31, 2010, the Company  has total capitalized exploration expenditures of US$150 million or 6.6% of the Company total consolidated assets as of that date.
The expenditures were substantially spent for the drilling activities  involving primarily sub-surface well equipment, not in the form of tangible assets on land, that have resulted in the discovery  of very significant volume of hydrocarbons that reside between  8,000 and 10,000 feet underground.
Therefore, the assets (i.
, the hydrocarbon reserves and the associated sub-surface well  equipment) are not exposed to the ongoing disturbances.
The  management is closely monitoring the situation in Libya, and intends to resume or continue operations when it is safe for the  Company personnel to do so.
While it is not presently possible  to determine the ultimate outcome of the political and security situation in Libya, the Company management is confident that its oil  project remains to be economically viable and realizable.
