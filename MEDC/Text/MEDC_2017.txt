the increase was due to higher retained  earnings from 2017 net income and higher capital stock  and additional paid in capital from the 2017 rights issue.
Due to the lower profit and increased share capital,  return on equity decreased from 20.82% in 2016 to  10.11% in 2017 .

the Company’s liquidity position is strong with adequate  resources and facilities to meet both current and near  term liabilities.
increase was due to the re-profiling of current maturities  with the uS$ global bond, the drawdown of long term  secured debt for the Block A Aceh gas development,  offset with the retirement of a Singapore listed bond  and repayment of bank loans.
