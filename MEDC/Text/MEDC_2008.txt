The Management discussion and analysis below should be read together with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the selected consolidated financial and operation data.
MedcoEnergi’s consolidated financial statements have  been prepared in accordance with Indonesian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as promulgated in the Indonesian Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (PSAK) and Regulation of the Indonesian Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Board (Bapepam-LK)	No.
G.7	regarding	Guidelines	to	the	Presentation of Financial Statements.
The presentation of this consolidated financial statements differ in certain material respects from the U.
GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The Company has applied the US dollar as its functional  currency based on its revenues, cash flows and expense indicators	as	required	by	PSAK	No.	52.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the  years	ended	December	31,	2008	and	2007	have	been	audited by the Public Accounting Firm of Purwantono, Sarwoko & Sandjaja with a fair and unqualified opinion.
Overview Despite the global economic downturn in the last quarter of 2008, MedcoEnergi managed to maintain a strong  financial and operational performance.
The high realized  average price of crude oil in 2008 enabled the Company to  post its highest revenue ever.
The launch of a new Corporate Strategy in the second  quarter of 2008, which focused MedcoEnergi’s business  activities on three business units, namely exploration  and production of oil and gas, power generation and  downstream industries, has reaffirmed the BOD’s  decision to dispose the Company’s drilling services  business unit, of which disposal has been completed in  September 2008.
Additionally, the Company has begun to  implement its assets optimisation program by exercising  the	divestment	of	its	25%	participating	interests	in	 the Tuban Block.
As a result, the Company was able  to gain significant proceeds from the disposal of those  subsidiaries and booked significant amount of other  income in 2008.
The highest revenue and significant amount of other  income recorded in 2008 have also enabled MedcoEnergi  to book its highest net income ever.
The highest net  income recorded consequently increased the Company’s net equity at the end of year 2008.
The disposal of the drilling services business and a  put option that was exercised by the Company’s USD  noteholders resulted in a decrease of the Company’s debts as at year-end 2008.
Therefore, the Company  managed to sustain a relatively low debt-to-equity-ratio  that provided the Company with the opportunity to obtain additional funding to finance its business growth.
In terms of liquidity, by year-end 2008 MedcoEnergi held  significant amount of cash and cash equivalent, short term investments that could be cashed in when necessary, as  well as trade and other receivables that are due within  one year period.
Additionally, the Company also held high  value assets that could be leveraged when necessary.
Consequently, despite the current tight financial liquidity in the market, the Company remains confident that by  implementing cost efficiency measures and prioritising  its allocation for capital expenditure and resources,  MedcoEnergi will be able to sustain its business growth.
The following discussion and analysis describe  MedcoEnergi’s performance during 2008.
Operating Performance Analysis MedcoEnergi’s financial results in 2008 were still derived from the operations of four business activities, namely  exploration and production of oil and gas, downstream  industries, power generation and drilling services.
The  disposal of drilling services business in the third quarter of 2008 resulted in a sharp decline in revenues derived from that operation in 2008.
The exploration and production of oil and gas still accounted for the majority of sales  and other operating revenues, followed by downstream  industries, power generation and drilling services.
The majority production costs were also spent in the  exploration and production of oil and gas, which consisted  of production and lifting cost, exploration cost and the  cost of crude oil purchases.
Meanwhile, the remaining  production costs were attributed to the costs spent for  the sales and operations in downstream industries, power  generation and drilling services.
In 2008, MedcoEnergi booked total sales and other operating	revenues	in	the	amount	of	US$1,286.3	million,	an	increase	of	19.3%	compared	to	US$1,078.0	million	in	2007.
On	the	other	hand,	production	costs	also	increased	by	12.9%	to	US$776.2	million	in	2008,	compared	to	US$687.7	million	in	2007.
The increase in total sales and other operating revenues,  as well as production costs were caused by the increase in net oil and gas sales, net sales of chemicals and other petroleum products, and electric power sales.
The hike in oil price is a key factor contributing to the Company’s increased revenues.
On the other hand, it also increased the field operations overhead, hence the overall production and lifting costs.
Meanwhile, the revenues from other contracts and revenues from drilling operations and related services declined due to the divestment of the drilling services business.
Production and SalesIn 2008, the Company’s oil and gas lifting declined by 9.9%	to	63.5	MBOEPD	from	70.5	MBOEPD	in	2007,	whereas	the	oil	and	gas	lifting	decreased	by	of	10.7%	and	8.0%	respectively,	to	45.0	MBOPD	and	108.1	BBTUPD	from	50.4	MBOPD	and	117.5	BBTUPD	in	2007.
The oil lifting decrease was mainly caused by a natural  decline of the Company’s oil reserves from Kaji and Semoga fields in the Rimau Block, as well as the divestment of participating interests in the Tuban Block and	the	expiry	of	Sanga-Sanga/Samboja/Tarakan	TAC	Blocks.
Meanwhile, the declining gas sales were due to lower gas off-take by the buyers from South Central Sumatra and Kakap Blocks, and the hurricane that struck offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Through-out 2008, MedcoEnergi sold most its Indonesian  net crude oil entitlements to Itochu Petroleum Co.
(Singapore) Pte Ltd (Itochu), BPMIGAS and PT Pertamina (Persero), while the oil production from the USA was sold to local customers.
Meanwhile, the Company’s gas production in Indonesia was supplied to the urea fertilizer plant of PT Pupuk Sriwijaya, several power plants of PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero) and the methanol plant operated by PT Medco Methanol Bunyu, while the USA’s gas production was supplied to local industries.
Net Sales of Oil and Gas The high realized average prices of oil and gas in 2008 of	US$101.0/barrel	and	US$4.2/mmbtu,	respectively,	increased the Company’s net sales of oil and gas by 19.0%	to	US$843.5	million	compared	to	US$708.6	million	in	2007.
The Company’s realized average oil price for crude oil sales  in Indonesia referred to the Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) published by the Department of Energy and Mining Resources, while the USA’s realized average oil price referred to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price.
The Company’s average realised oil prices for 2008  and	2007	were	US$101.0/barrel	and	US$72.5/barrel,	respectively,	an	increase	of	39.3%.
The	Company’s	average realized gas price for the years ended December 31,	2008	and	2007	was	US$4.2/mmbtu	and	US$3.2/mmbtu,	respectively,	an	increase	of	31.3%.
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs The costs incurred in the oil and gas activities consist of production and lifting cost, exploration cost, and costs  of crude oil purchases and depreciation, depletion and  amortization.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties, except un-operated acreages and uncompleted wells, equipment and facilities, are calculated based on the unit-of-production method, using the gross production divided by gross proved developed reserves.
Depreciation of supporting facilities and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over a period of four to 20 years, to reflect the economic benefits of these assets.
The declining depreciation, depletion and amortization  costs	by	40.5%	to	US$105.0	million	in	2008,	from	US$176.6	million	in	2007,	were	mainly	due	to	the	expiration of the Technical Assistance Contract in Sanga-Sanga area; the depletion of some domestic maturing blocks.
Production and Lifting Costs Production and lifting costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and employees’ benefits, materials and supplies and contract charges.
These costs are mainly affected by the level of production, field operations overhead, operations and maintenance costs, operations support and pipeline fees.
Total	production	and	lifting	costs	increased	by	19.8%	to	 US$250.6	million	in	2008,	from	US$209.2	million	in	2007,	mainly due to the hike of oil price, as well as the efforts in maintaining the level of production in the Rimau Block through the implementation of EOR Pilot Project, and the completion of additional facilities and development wells to increase production volume in the SCS Block.
Exploration Costs Exploration costs include dry hole cost, geological and  geophysical cost, seismic costs, exploration overheads,  and provision for suspended wells.
Exploration costs vary with the level of exploration activities and the success rate of such activities.
The Company uses the  “successful efforts method” of accounting for oil and  gas exploration expenses.
Accordingly, costs related to  acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties, the costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells that locate or result in proved reserves, and the costs of drilling  and equipping development wells, including the costs  of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells, are Analisa dan Pembahasan Manajemen Atas Kinerja MedcoEnergi Annual Report 2008 131uji exploratory type stratigraphic, semuanya dicatatkan  sebagai bagian dari sumur yang belum terselesaikan, peralatan dan fasilitas sampai saat mana eksplorasi tersebut dinyatakan tidak berhasil.
Industri Hilirinitially capitalized and recorded as part of uncompleted wells, equipment and facilities until the exploration is determined to be unsuccessful.
Exploration expenses for dry holes are expensed in the year in which the exploration effort is determined to be unsuccessful.
Total	exploration	costs	increased	by	17.6%	to	US$64.9	 million	in	2008,	from	US$55.2	million	in	2007,	mainly	due to dry hole cost as well as provisionary cost for suspended wells in 2008, primarily related to wells in the Indonesian blocks, which in total was amounting to US$30.6	million.
Cost of Crude Oil Purchases Total cost of crude oil purchases from BPMIGAS and  Pertamina	decreased	by	13.8%	to	US$34.4	million	in	2008,	from	US$40.0	million	in	2007,	mainly	due	to	the	fact that there was no over-lift of crude oil from the Rimau Block.
The Company’s only over-lift of crude oil was from Tiaka field.
In 2008, a slight increase of gas supplied from Tarakan  block enabled MedcoEnergi to increase its methanol production	by	13.5%	to	129.6	thousand	MT	compared	to	114.2	thousand	MT	in	2007.
Consequently,	the	sales	of	methanol	in	2008	increased	by	5.4%	to	123.3	thousand	from	117	thousand	MT	in	2007.
The natural declining of crude oil production in the Rimau  Block in 2008 had decreased the petroleum associated gas	supplied	to	the	LNG	plant	by	38.4%	to	2,619	MMCF,	from	4,250	MMCF	in	2007.
As	a	result,	the	production	of LPG as well as condensate and lean gas decreased by 37.7%,	36.2%	and	29.3%,	respectively,	to	16.7	thousand	MT,	61.6	thousand	barrel	and	2,105	MMCF;	from	26.8	Management Discussion and Analysis on Performance Laporan Tahunan MedcoEnergi 2008 132MMCF;	dari	masing-masing	26,8	ribu	MT,	96,5	ribu	barel	 and	2.979	MMCF	di	tahun	2007.
Ketenagalistrikanthousand	MT,	96.5	thousand	barrel	and	2,979	MMCF,	respectively,	in	2007.
Meanwhile, the full operation of fuel storage facilities and  distribution of HSD in 2008 enabled MedcoEnergi to sell 196,8	thousand	KL	of	HSD,	while	in	2007,	MedcoEnergi	sold	HSD	in	the	total	volume	of	47	thousand	KL.
Sales of Chemicals and Other Petroleum Products With a higher sales volume and average price for both methanol	and	HSD	in	2008,	which	were	US$315/MT	and	Rp8,241/KL,	respectively,	MedcoEnergi	booked	a	net	sales of chemicals and other petroleum products in the total	amount	of	US$215.9	million,	increasing	by	351.7%	 compared	to	US$47.8	million	in	2007.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of buildings for 20 years, machinery and equipment for eight years, motor vehicles for five years, office equipment for three years and leasehold improvement for three and eight years.
In 2008, MedcoEnergi booked depreciation in the  operation of downstream industries business in the total amount	of	US$3.8	million,	an	increase	of	26.6%	compared	to	US$3.0	million	in	2007.
The	increase	was	due	to	the	full	operation of the fuels storage facilities in 2008.
Costs of Sales of Chemicals and Other Petroleum  ProductsCosts of chemicals sales and other petroleum products consist of costs of HSD sales, feed gas of methanol plant, rentals of methanol plant, operational plant, salaries and other allowances of employees, contract labor, fuel consumption, material and supplied used, and others.
The total	cost	in	2008	was	US$209.1	million,	increasing	by	463.6%	compared	to	US$37.1	million	in	2007.
The increase in the cost of sales of chemicals and other  petroleum products were caused by:•	 Higher	volume	of	HSD	sales;•	 Higher	volume	of	feed	gas;•	 Higher	rental	fees	of	methanol	plant	and	operational	 costs of plant due to higher sales of methanol volume.
However,	the	Company	managed	to	increase the production of power plant operated under the Operation and Maintenance Services Agreement by 24.2%	to	9,082	GWH	in	2008,	compared	to	7,313	GWH	in	2007.
Electric Power Sales In 2008, the Company booked electric power sales in the	amount	of	US$81.9	million,	an	increase	of	58.1%	compared	to	US$51.8	million	in	2007.
MedcoEnergi’s sales from its power generation business  was derived from the sales of electricity generated from the Company’s power plants, Panaran I and II, O&M services provided to PLN’s Tanjung Jati B power plant, and EPC services provided to PLN and other customers.
The increase in sales in the power generation business  was due to additional revenues from EPC and Project Management services, as well as performance incentive received from O&M services provided to the Tanjung Jati B power plant.
Depreciation and Amortization Costs Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: computers, motor vehicles, equipment, furnitures and fixtures for four years.
The Company’s depreciation and amortization in the  operation	of	power	business	decreased	by	18.7%	to	US$3.2	million	in	2008,	from	US$3.9	million	in	2007,	due	to weakening of Rupiah against US Dollar.
Cost of Electric Power Sales Costs of electric power sales represent expenses, such as maintenance costs and salaries as well as gas purchases related to the Batam power plant.
In	2008,	MedcoEnergi	spent	US$60.7	million,	an	increase 	 of	117.6%	compared 	to	US$27.9 	million	in	2007.
The	 increase	was	primarily	due	to	the	full	operation 	of	TM	2500,	 EPC services business and increase in the price of gas  supply in DEB.

As a result, effective from the divestment, MedcoEnergi did not consolidate the financial data of its drilling services business any longer.
Therefore, at year-end 2008, the Company only  consolidated financial data up to the effective divestment,  and booked revenues from drilling operations and related  services	in	the	amount	of	US$53.4	million	and	revenues	from	other	contracts	in	the	amount	of	US$5.8	million.
Meanwhile, the Company booked the depreciation,  depletion	and	amortization	expenses	of	US$10.7	million,	 and drilling operation costs of US$33.8 million, decreased by	67.6%	compared	to	US$104.3	million	in	2007.
Operating Expenses The Company’s operating expenses in the drilling services business consist of expenses incurred for general and  administrative (G&A) purposes and other expenses used  for sales purposes.
Operating	expenses	increased	by	15.7%	to	US$163.8	million	in	2008,	from	US$141.6	million	in	2007.
The	increase was mainly due to higher expenses incurred for G&A which was caused by the increase in salaries, wages and employees benefits related to cost of living adjustments; professional fees, and contract charges.
Operating Income The high sales and other operating revenues booked in 2008 has enabled the Company to record Income from operations	in	the	amount	of	US$346.3	million,	significantly	increase	by	39.2%	compared	to	US$248.7	million	in	2007.
Other Income (Expenses) MedcoEnergi’s other income (expenses) in 2008 consist of net gain on the disposal of subsidiaries, income from the termination of Exploration Joint Venture Agreement (EJVA) with Anadarko, uplift income, equity rights on the net income of associated entities, interest expense, loss on impairment of assets, loss on short term investments, financing charges, loss from derivative transactions and foreign exchange, and other charges.
In 2008, the Company booked other income (net) in the	total	amount	of	US$153.5	million,	while	in	2007	 the Company booked other expenses in the amount of  US$126.7	million.
The	Company	booked	other	income	in	2008 primary due to the disposal of shares in the drilling  services	business,	Apexindo,	and	25%	participating	 interests in the Tuban Block.
The Company booked other expenses in the amount of  US$157.1	million	in	2008.
The	high	other	expenses	in	 2008, in addition to interest expenses, financing expenses and loss on the imparment of assets, was also due to the  impact of the global financial turmoil at year-end 2008.
As a result, the Company had to book both realized and unrealized losses on financial transactions in 2008, in the form of short-term investments, derivative and foreign  exchange transactions.
The following describes other income and expenses  booked by the Company in 2008.

d) Equity in net income of associated entities, namely in the	amount	of	US$9.9	million	that	was	booked	due	to changes in the posting of Apexindo’s financial data from consolidated method to equity method since the completion	of	shares	sale	on	March	26,	2008.
MedcoEnergi’s	EBITDA	in	2008	increased	by	63.7%	to	US$668.6	million,	from	US$408.5	million	in	2007.
The	increase was mainly due to the high operating income achieved in 2008 and proceeds from divestment.
Other Charges In 2008, the Company booked other charges in the amount	of	US$157.1	million,	an	increase	of	12.9%	compared	to	US$139.2	million	in	2007.
The increase in other charges was partly due to the  posting of routine expenses on the net interests of Rupiah bonds	and	bank	loans	in	the	amount	of	US$46.2	million	and	financing	charges	in	the	amount	of	US$17.3	million	as	a result of short and long-term borrowings obtained during the year which caused the increase in amortization costs and other expenses related to the financing activities in 2008.
Additionally, the worst condition of financial market due to global financial turmoil at the end of year resulted the Company to book: a) Loss on short term investment booked by the  Company	in	the	amount	of	US$33.9	million,	of	which	US$28.1 million was recognized as unrealized loss.
Pajak Penghasilanb) Loss in derivative and exchange rate transactions in the respective amount of US$10.0 million and US$8.8 million.
The loss was due to the application of hedging program on the Company Rupiah bonds through Cross Currency Swap (CCS).
Pursuant to PSAK No. 55	regarding	Accounting	of	Derivative	Instruments	and Hedging Activities, CCS does not meet criteria of hedging transactions.
Therefore, any movement of swap fair value shall be recognized as gain or loss during that period even though the gain or loss has not been realized yet.
In addition to charges related to financing activities and the loss on financial transactions, the increase in other charges was also due to the posting of loss on the Company’s	impairment	of	assets	of	US$39.2	million	in	2008.
Loss on the impairment of assets resulted from the revaluation of oil and gas reserves and assets valuation on the Sembakung Block, Bangkanai Block and Jeruk field.
Tax Expense The	Company’s	tax	expense	increased	by	120.9%	to	US$210.7	million	in	2008,	compared	to	US$95.4	million	in	2007.
The	increase	was	mainly	due	to	the	increase	in	current tax and deferred tax expenses of subsidiaries.
Current Tax The	Company’s	current	tax	increased	by	26.2%	to	US$170.4	million	in	2008,	compared	to	US$135.0	million	in	2007.
The	increase	was	maily	due	to	higher	taxable	income that was subject to a final income tax in 2008 amounting	to	US$248.2	million	compared	to	US$12.0	million	in	2007.
Deferred Tax The Company’s deferred tax expense in 2008 amounted to	US$40.3	million,	compared	to	US$39.6	million	of	deferred	tax	benefit	in	2007.
The	deferred	tax	expense	in	2008	was	mainly	due	to	a	fiscal	loss	of	US$25.7	million and the deferred tax assets of the Company and subsidiaries amounting to US$82.2 million.

Total Assets The Company’s total assets at year-end 2008 decreased to	US$1,980.2	million,	or	by	9.2%,	compared	to	US$2,179.8	million	at	year-end	2007.
The	decrease	was	mainly due to deconsolidation of Apexindo.
Current Assets Total	current	assets	increased	by	16.1%	to	US$862.8	million	in	2008,	compared	to	US$743.2	million	in	2007.
The increase was due to: 1.
The increase in the amount of cash and cash equivalent	to	US$348.5	million	in	2008,	an	increase	of	30.9%	compared	to	US$266.4	million	in	2007.

An	increase	in	short	term	investments	by	106.1%	 to	US$174.0	million,	compared	to	US$84.4	million	in	2007.
An increase in other receivables from third parties of	US$156.2	million	in	2008,	an	increase	of	136.3%	compared	to	US$66.1	million	in	2007.
The	increase	was	attributed	to	the	account	receivable	of	US$70.6	million from Sabre Systems International Pte.
Ltd, a subsidiary of the buyer of Apexindo.
Meanwhile, the Company’s trade receivables in 2008 decline	drastically	by	40.8%	to	US$129.8	million	from	US$219.2	million	in	2007	due	to	the	deconsolidation	of	trade receivables from Apexindo at the end of year 2008.
The Company’s BOD believes that trade receivables and  other receivables from third parties could be collected  on schedule.
Therefore, the Company is in the opinion  that allowances for doubtful accounts of around US$0.1 million	in	2008	compared	to	US$0.3	million	in	2007	is	adequate to cover possible losses on uncollectible trade receivables accounts.
Meanwhile for the other receivables from third parties, the Company has set aside allowances for	doubtful	accounts	totaling	US$6.5	million	in	2008,	compared	to	US$3.7	million	in	2007.

The decline of investments in shares of stock in 2008 by	38.0%	to	US$10.5	million,	compared	to	US$16.9	million	in	2007. 2.
The decline of investment in projects in 2008 by 12.4%	to	US$31.7	million,	from	US$36.2	million	in	2007	due	to	a	recognition	of	loss	from	the	impairment	of Jeruk project. 3.
The decline in property, plant and equipment in 2008 by	69.9%	to	US$157.4	million,	from	US$523.0	million	in	2007	due	to	the	divestment	of	the	Company’s	shares in Apexindo.
At the end of year 2008, the Company’s total liabilities decreased	by	19.4%	to	US$1,234.8	million	compared	to	at	the	end	of	year	2007	totalling	US$1,531.1	million.
The decrease was mainly due to the declining of the  Company’s non current liabilities.
Current Liabilities The Company’s total current liabilities at the end of year 2008	increased	by	13.2%	to	US$387.8	million	compared	to	US$342.5	million	at	the	end	of	year	2007.
Jumlah HutangThe increase was mainly due to the recording of the  Company’s	Rupiah	bonds	in	the	amount	of	US$107.8	million	that	will	be	matured	in	July	2009.
Non-current Liabilities At the end of year 2008, the Company recorded non-current	liabilities	in	the	amount	of	US$847.1	million,	declined	by	28.7%	compared	to	US$1,188.6	million	at	the	end	of	year	2007.
The declining of non-current liabilities was caused by the  exercised of US dollar bonds’ buy back and put option, and the un-consolidated of Apexindo’s Rupiah bonds and bank loans.
Bank Loans The Company’s total bank loans at the end of year 2008 increased	by	14.0%	to	US$348.5	million	compared	to	US$305.7	million	in	2007.
The	increase	was	due	to	the	32.3%	increase	of	the	 Company’s	long	term	bank	loans	to	US$288.4	million	from	US$217.9	million	in	2007,	as	a	result	of	additional	bank	facilities obtained by the Company and its subsidiaries for the purpose of refinancing of Company’s maturing obligations, as well as funding the operations and projects of its subsidiaries.
Meanwhile, the current portion of long-term	bank	loans	decreased	by	31.6%	to	US$60.1	million	at	the	end	of	year	2008	compared	to	US$87.8	million	at	the	end	of	year	2007	due	to	the	deconsolidation	of	Apexindo’s bank loans at the end of year 2008.

Meanwhile, current portion of long-term debt increased due to the maturity of the	Company’s	Rupiah	bonds	in	July	2009.
The Company is confident that with cash at hands, and  additional bank loans facilities obtained during the year 2008,	it	will	be	able	to	service	its	obligations	in	2009.
Additionally, with a lower amount of debts, the Company also will have a low debt of equity ratios.
Thus, the Company would have an opportunity to adding new debts to finance the necessary capital expenditures and its key development projects.
Struktur ModalThe	Company’s	total	equity	increased	by	40.6%	to	US$733.2	million	at	the	end	of	year	2008	compared	to	US$521.3	million	at	the	end	of	year	2007.

The	net	cash	for financing activities in 2008 was used, among others, for payment of notes payable, buyback of treasury notes, payment of bank loans, payment of interest and financing charges as well as shares buyback.

Business Prospect The Company believes that its prospect in the Oil and Gas  business remains very promising.
As such, the Company continues to focus on the business.
With the progress of its seven key development projects, of which five are directly related to oil and gas in Indonesia and abroad, including the Gas Reserve Monetization Project at Senoro, Sulawesi, and the Company’s project in Libya with its huge oil and gas contingent resources.
Furthermore, one of the rapidly growing energy needed  today and in the years to come is electricity.
As such, the Company continues to increase its production of electricity by developing more power plants, such as the geothermal power plant in Sarulla, North Sumatra.
This is in line with the Company’s strategy to capitalise on clean energy opportunities that are increasingly sought as an alternative source of renewable energy.
Economic Analysis A majority portion of Indonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is derived from domestic consumption.
Net export alone	only	contributes	some	10%	of	GDP,	whereas	both	government and private sector consumption account for 65%.
Amidst	the	global	economic	downturn,	these	figures	still represent a condusive economy for businesses in Indonesia.
Although	economic	conditions	in	2009	will	still	be	clouded	 by the global economic recession, the Indonesian economy is estimated to maintain growth in the range Management Discussion and Analysis on Performance Laporan Tahunan MedcoEnergi 2008 1466,1	persen.
of	5.5-6.1%.
This	is	further	supported	by	several	positive	 economic indicators that were released by the Ministry  of Finance such as electricity consumption that showed  a	significant	in	March	2009.
Such	an	increase	in	power	 consumption could only be attributed to a general increase  in industrial activities, indicating a strengthening national  economy.
Based on industry figures, Indonesia’s trade  balance will continue to be positive despite a decline to  0.5%	of	GDP,	compared	to	2.1%	of	GDP	in	2008.
The target for inflation set by the government for the  year	2009	is	within	the	range	of	6.5-7.5	per	cent,	lower	 than the inflation rate in 2008.
The low targeted inflation rate could lead to a lowering of bank interest rate.
The assumption for the benchmark three month Bank Indonesia	Certificate	(SBI)	rate	for	2009	is	8.5	per	cent.
Economic	growth	rate	in	2009	is	targeted	at	5.5-6.1	per	cent.
The price of Indonesian crude is assumed to be US$85	in	2009.
Bank Indonesia Interest Rates and Inflation Rates Bank Indonesia reduced its prime interest rate (BI Rate) by 50	basis	points	to	7.75%,	from	8.25%	at	the	start	of	2009.
The global economic downturn was the basis for the interest rate cut.
The current global economic trend that still indicate a deep recession, is reflected in the contraction of the economiies of advanced nations that have fallen steeper than previously anticipated, not to mention the vulnerable global financial markets as major financial institutions around the world continue to report falling earnings.
Bank Indonesia is expected to further reduce its  benchmark	interest	rate	by	25	basis	points	from	7.50%	to	7.25%.
By	the	end	of	2009,	it	is	expected	that	Bank	Indonesia	will	again	reduce	the	benchmark	rate	to	6.50%.
However, the bank credit interest rates have only fallen by 0.38	basis	points	since	the	start	of	2009	due	to	the	fact	that banks are wary of reducing of their lending rates in anticipation of a worsening global economic crisis.
Rupiah Currency Exchange Rate Based on market estimates, the Rupiah will reach an equilibrium of Rp11,000 to the US dollar, or an average of	Rp11,000	to	the	US$	throughout	the	year	2009.
The	government has taken measures to defend the Rupiah, among other things, as follows: -  The national banking sector has been prohibited  from undertaking transactions in foreign exchange structured products or derivative transactions without the underlying assets.
-  Indonesian citizens have to show proof of transactions and include their Tax Identification Number to undertake foreign exchange transactions in nominal sum of more than US$100,000.
-  State-owned companies are required to place their foreign currency reserves in local banks and are required to report their foreign currency needs periodically.
-  Expedite development projects that derive their financing in foreign currency.
Analisa dan Pembahasan Manajemen Atas Kinerja MedcoEnergi Annual Report 2008 147-  State-owned companies are prohibited from  transferring their funds from one bank to another to gain from interest rate differential.
-  The government and Bank Indonesia will redeem  government bonds.
-  Annulment of taxation on the sale of the palm oil  comodity and streamline the processing of Letter of credits (LC) for exports.
-  Form inter-departmental teams to undertake oversight  of the movements of goods and funds.
Generating Business Opportunities The Company is also evaluating several new business  opportunities in the field of energy through its Incubator  business unit.
The Company believes that the need for  global energy will increase in the future while oil and gas  are energy forms that are not renewable.
Therefore, the  Company sees a huge opportunity to participate in other energy fields, such as Coal Bed Methane (CBM), coal, and  the renewable energy form of ethanol.
The Company sees  an opportunity to support the government in bio-ethanol  development that could reduce import for fuels.
The  Government	has	also	decreed	the	use	of	25%	ethanol	content in petrol.
In the prospects of coal, the Company realised that  consumption of coal has increased rapidly over the past several years.
The growth in global coal consumption  is directly related to the growing need of global energy  in which coal represents the second largest source of  energy after oil.
Indonesia itself has experienced a similar  growth in coal consumption over the past decade.
This consumption increase has been spurred by demand for  coal as a source of fuel, primarily for power plants in  Indonesia as well as those countries that import their coal  from Indonesia.
CBM is a relatively new, alternative source of energy.
The methane gas derived from coal beds can be used  as a valuable source of energy.
Although its is derived  from fossil fuel that is not renewable, the gas can be  produced from coal beds without having to mine the coal, and therefore would have less impact on environmental  conservation.
In line with the ever growing need for energy, for both  electricity and transportation, developing nations such as  Indonesia also require alternative forms of energy that  can be developped sustainably.
If opportunities from the  business Incubator are deemed viable, the Company will  allocate funds to develop the business further.
