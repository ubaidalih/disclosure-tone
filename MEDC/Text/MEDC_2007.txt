MEDCOENERGI 2007: Developing the Company and Delivering on Our Goals 82MedcoEnergi’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in  accordance with Indonesian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as promulgated by Indonesian Financal Accounting Standards (PSAK).
These principles diﬀer in certain material respects from U.
GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The Company’s reporting currency is U.
S dollars, which represents its functional currency based on its revenues, cash ﬂows and expense indicators as required under Indonesian SFAS 52.
Overview MedcoEnergi substantially derives all of its total sales and other operating revenues from net oil and gas sales, revenues from drilling operations and related services, net chemical and other petroleum product sales, electric power sales, and share of proﬁts in joint ventures.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, MedcoEnergi had total sales  and other operating revenues of USD 981.9 million, an increase of 23.9% from USD 792.4 million in 2006.
MedcoEnergi’s EBITDA for 2007 was USD 435 million, an increase of 43% from USD 304.0 million in 2006.
Meanwhile, MedcoEnergi’s net income for 2007 was USD 6.5 million, a decrease of 82.9% from USD 38.2 million in 2006.
MedcoEnergi’s ﬁnancial performance is aﬀected by a number of  external variables, both within and outside of the petroleum industry, including political, economic and social conditions in Indonesia.
Business Environment and Risk Assessment Regulatory, Political And General Economic EnvironmentMedcoEnergi is headquartered in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia with ﬁeld operating oﬃces dispersed in each of its production areas.
The majority of MedcoEnergi’s assets and operations are in Indonesia.
MedcoEnergi’s performance can be aﬀected by changes in its business environment which are not within its control.
Risks relating to Indonesia are primarily connected to the country’s political instability, involving changes in Government, Government policies, the Government’s failure or inability to implement necessary reforms, terrorist acts as well as social instability and increasing regional autonomy.
In addition to economic and political risks, the Indonesian archipelago is subject to signiﬁcant natural or geological risks including earthquakes, tsunamis, ﬂoods, etc.
Accordingly, MedcoEnergi’s performance is subject to changes in  Government policies, social instability or other political, economic, legal, regulatory or international developments.
These risks might have an impact on MedcoEnergi in terms of its ﬁnancial condition and results of operations, as well as investor’s conﬁdence in Indonesia and Indonesian stock prices General Business Risks Foreign Exchange RisksAll major contracts entered into by MedcoEnergi have historically been denominated in U.
dollars, and it is anticipated that this will continue to be the case.
Consequently, a majority of MedcoEnergi’s revenues and cash expenses are denominated in U.
Certain expenses comprising the salaries of Indonesian employees, local vendors, local rentals and interest income/expense are normally paid in Rupiah.
MedcoEnergi is also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk resulting primarily from ﬂuctuations in exchange rates in the translation of its Rupiah denominated loans.
As of December 31, 2007, MedcoEnergi maintained Rupiah denominated loans equivalent to USD 254.8 million.
Interest Rate Risks MedcoEnergi is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from ﬂuctuations in interest rates on its short-term and long-term borrowings.
Upward ﬂuctuations in interest rates increase the cost of new borrowings and the interest cost of MedcoEnergi’s outstanding ﬂoating rate borrowings.
Capital Requirements The Company expects certain projects currently under development to signiﬁcantly increase its cash ﬂow.
If such projects do not increase revenue as expected, or, if, following such increases, revenue subsequently declines, the Company may have limited sources of cash to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete the programs.
There is no certainty that debt or equity ﬁnancing or cash generated by operations will be available or suﬃcient to meet these requirements.
The inability of the Company to access suﬃcient capital for its operations and future expansion could have a material adverse eﬀect on the Company’s ﬁnancial conditions directly impacting results of its operations or future prospects Speciﬁc Segment Risks Risks Relating to Oil and Gas OperationsApproximately 66% of MedcoEnergi’s revenues are derived from oil and gas production.
Its revenues are therefore in large part determined by the diﬀerence between the prices received for the oil and gas it produces and the costs of exploring for, developing, producing and selling these products.
Consequently, similar with other oil and gas operating companies in Indonesia, MedcoEnergi is, among others, subject to risks connected with prevailing world oil prices and Indonesian domestic energy prices.
Accordingly, volatilities in prices and demand for crude oil and condensate as well as natural gas have signiﬁcant eﬀects on MedcoEnergi’s future revenues and net income.
The market price of crude oil has been and are expected to continue to be volatile and are subject to a variety of factors beyond MedcoEnergi’s control.
Additionally, MedcoEnergi is exposed to operating risks, including  reservoir risks, risks of loss of oil and gas and natural calamities and risks in respect of all its installations and facilities.
Drilling hazards or environmental damage could furthermore increase the costs of operations, and various ﬁeld operating conditions may aﬀect MedcoEnergi’s production levels from successful wells.
These conditions include delays in obtaining Government approvals or consents, shut-in of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions, insuﬃcient storage or transportation capacity or other geological and mechanical conditions.
Production delays and declines from normal ﬁeld operating conditions may have unfavorable eﬀects on revenue and cash ﬂow to a varying degree.
The occurrence of a signiﬁcant event that MedcoEnergi is not fully insured against, or the insolvency of the insurer of such an event, could have a material adverse eﬀect on MedcoEnergi as well.

*  Audited by P ublic  Accountant Oﬃce  Purwantono, Sarwoko & Sandjaja (E&Y) (1)  Revenues from other contracts represent back charges related to the Company’s drilling operations, operation  and management services for Tanjung Jati B and other business .
The detail discussions will focus on the  revenues from drilling and power operations.
Oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia are subject to the  prevailing laws and regulations, particularly the Indonesian Oil and Gas Law No. 22/2001 and as well as each operations Production Sharing Contract (PSC).
Amongst the key terms and conditions under such Oil and Gas Law and PSC are the cost recovery arrangements and the Domestic Market Obligation (DMO).
For every barrel produced, an oil and gas company that operates under a PSC is entitled to recover costs pertaining to the exploration and production activities carried out during the year.
The cost recovery portion of the net entitlement varies with the level of cost incurred, including capital investment for exploration, development and production, annual operating expenses and the market prices of oil and gas.
Risks Relating to Drilling Services Operations MedcoEnergi’s Drilling Business makes up approximately 16% of MedcoEnergi’s total revenues.
The contract drilling industry has always been highly volatile, competitive and cyclical, with periods of low demand, excess rig supply and depressed rig dayrates.
The contract drilling business is inﬂuenced by many factors beyond the control of MedcoEnergi, such as the worldwide demand for, and the prices of oil and natural gas, operational risks as well as the ability of OPEC to inﬂuence production levels and pricing and the level of production of non-OPEC countries.
There can be no assurance as to the duration of prevailing utilization and dayrates, and a decline in utilization and dayrates may have a material adverse eﬀect on MedcoEnergi.
Risks Relating to Downstream Operations Approximately 5% of MedcoEnergi’s revenues are derived from the sales of methanol produced by the Company’s subsidiary, PT Medco Methanol Bunyu.
Revenues from methanol sales depend on the production volume and the prevailing methanol price.
The production volume depends on the availability of gas supply.
Methanol prices are volatile in nature, ﬂuctuating based on the world’s trend in supply and demand of methanol.
Risks Relating to Power Operations Approximately 3.4% of MedcoEnergi’s revenues are derived from the sales of electricity and provision of services relating to power generation by the Company’s subsidiaries.
The Power business in Indonesia is highly regulated business and is subject to subsidies which aﬀect the tariﬀs that can be charged to the oﬀ-taker.
Furthermore, the business is inﬂuenced by factors beyond the control of MedcoEnergi such as new market entrants, prices and gas supply as well as operating risks inherent in the industry.
The risks covered here are not all inclusive and other possible risks and  uncertainties could arise.
Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain summarized historical consolidated ﬁnancial data of MedcoEnergi as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.
The summarized historical consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were audited by Ernst & Young .
As per the above table, in 2007, MedcoEnergi recognized total sales and revenues of USD 981.9 million, an increase of 24% or equal to USD 189.5 million compared to USD 792.3 million in 2006 .
The overall increase was due to the increase in revenues from:• net oil and gas sales driven by higher realized oil and gas prices;• revenue from drilling operations and related services, as a result of  an increased demand for rig services and higher rental prices; • revenues from other contracts due to higher back charges from  drilling services, higher production rates in Tanjung Jati B and Oman in which MedcoEnergi provides operation and maintenance services;  • net sales of chemicals and other petroleum products due to higher  realized methanol prices and the operation of a high speed diesel distribution facility beginning in June 2007;Consolidated Sales and Revenues MEDCOENERGI 2007: Developing the Company and Delivering on Our Goals 84realized weighted average oil price increased by 13.3% to USD 72.49/Bbl  in 2007 from USD 63.98/Bbl in 2006.
MedcoEnergi sells its net crude oil entitlement through competitive  tender processes, subject to market conditions, and enters into short-term sales contracts with the winning bidders.
Crude oil entitlement not sold pursuant to a sales contract can readily be sold in the spot market, albeit without the modest premium aﬀorded by a sales contract.
Substantially all of MedcoEnergi’s net crude entitlement in 2007 was sold to Itochu Petroleum Co.
Gas and LPG - Revenues Gas sales contracts are typically long-term ﬁxed price contracts.
The increase in gas revenue was due to higher realized gas prices, which outweighed a decline in gas production.
Gas sales increased by 8% in 2007 to USD 74.3 million from USD 68.6  million in 2006.
Gas production decreased by 7.6 % in 2007 to 117.53 BBTUPD from  127.15 BBTUPD in 2006 mainly from a reduction of gas in the Tarakan PSC and the divestment of Brantas which still contributed to gas sales volumes in 2006, oﬀset by new sales contracts entered into by the South Central Sumatra PSC.
The decrease in gas volume was compensated by higher realized weighted average gas price to USD 3.19/MMBTU in 2007, or an increase of 14.5% from USD 2.78/MMBTU in 2006.
LPG sales decreased by 33% to USD 7.2 million in 2007 from USD 10.7  million in 2006.
A lower supply of associated gas from oil production in Rimau block  decreased LPG sales/production by 26.4% in 2007 to 73.73 MTD from 100.13 MTD in 2006.
However, this was partly oﬀset by an increase in realized LPG price by 39.0% in 2007 to USD 440.12/MT from USD 316.56/MT in 2006 .
The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization by USD 65.8 million or 70% in 2007 was mainly due to higher depletion expense from the Company’s US assets (additional DD&A of approximately    USD 30.7 million due to an impairment adjustment in the Company’s East Cameron block), higher depletion from its Rimau and East Kalimantan blocks in line with the remaining life of reserves/production and PSC contract, and due to increase in production of gas from the South Central Sumatra block.

Consolidated Production CostsAs per the consolidated sales and revenues table, MedcoEnergi recognized production costs of USD 613.6 million in 2007, an increase of 22% or equal to USD 108.6 million compared to USD 504.9 million in 2006.
The increase was mainly driven by higher depreciation depletion and amortization, costs, production and lifting costs, exploration expenses, cost of crude oil purchases, drilling operations costs, cost of sales of chemical and other petroleum products, and cost of electric power sales but was oﬀset by a decrease in share of loss in joint ventures.
A more detailed overview of the results and costs of operations from the  respective segments is outlined below.
Oil and Gas MedcoEnergi classiﬁes its revenues and expenses from exploration and production of oil and gas primarily on the basis of whether the ﬁelds are operated directly by MedcoEnergi or by third parties.
Revenues and expenses from ﬁelds operated directly by MedcoEnergi are presented under the respective income and expense accounts, including net oil and gas sales, depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and lifting costs, exploration expenses and operating expenses.

Oil – Revenues The increase in oil revenue was due to the higher realized oil prices,  which outweighed a decline in oil production.
The Company’s average lifting volume of oil decreased by 10.6% in 2007  to 50.41 MBOPD from 56.37 MBOPD in 2006.
The decrease was mainly due to the natural decline in oil production in the Rimau block.

Demand for drilling rigs is aﬀected by a number of factors, primarily demand for oil and natural gas products, the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and general worldwide economic and market conditions.
Revenues from drilling operations and related services totaled USD  160.7 million in 2007 representing an increase of 31% compared to  2006. 120% 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0%Drilling Utilization Rates  FY 2007 FY200 6Oﬀshore - Jack UpOﬀshore - Swampbarges Onshore During 2007, the Company maintained 100% utilization rates for  swamp-barge oﬀshore rigs and slightly increased daily revenues by 6.7% to USD 53,019 from USD 49,677 in 2006.
On the contrary, the utilization rate of the Company’s jack-up oﬀshore rigs declined by 50% to 50% in 2007 from 100% in 2006.
In 2007, the Company owned and operated 2 jack-up oﬀshore rigs (Raniworo and Soehanah) while in 2006 the Company only owned and operated the Raniworo rig.
The decline in utilization rates of jack-up oﬀshore rigs was due to the refurbishment of the Raniworo rig in conjunction with the preparation to enter into a new contract and late commencement of the Soehanah rig operation during 2007 period.
The lower utilization rate was partially compensated by the increase in average daily revenue for jack-up oﬀshore rigs by 7.0% in 2007 to USD 76,211 from USD 71,221 in 2006.
The increase in oil price has bolstered the demand of rigs.
Thus in 2007,  the Company acquired new contracts for onshore rigs which resulted in a slight increase in rig utilization to 70% from 68% in 2006.
At the same time, the increase in demand in onshore rigs also increased the rental rate, thus the daily revenue increased signiﬁcantly by 13.8% in 2007 to USD 22,530 from USD 19,791 in 2006.

The increase was primarily attributed to the overall increase in drilling operations.
Production and lifting costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and employees’ beneﬁts, materials and supplies and contract charges.
These costs are mainly aﬀected by the level of production, ﬁeld operations overhead, operations and maintenance costs, operations support and pipeline fees.
Total production and lifting costs increased by 39% to USD 147 million in  2007 from USD 106 million in 2006 mainly due to eﬀorts to maintain the level of the production in the Rimau block and increase production in the South Central Sumatra block.

In this respect, exploration expenses include dry hole costs, geological and geophysical costs and exploration overheads.
Exploration expenses vary with the level of exploration activities and the success rate of such activities.
Exploration expenses increased by 16% from prior year primarily relating to exploration activities in the US, Libya and various blocks in Indonesia.
The Cost of Crude Oil Purchases increased by 29% to USD 40 million in  2007 from USD 30.9 million in 2006 mainly due to the overlifting of the Company’s entitlement in the Rimau Block and Pertaminas’ portion in the Tiaka Field .

On March 15, 2007, MedcoEnergi and Pertamina signed the amendment of Methanol Bunyu Plant operatorship agreement with eﬀective date on January 01, 2006 in which Pertamina is entitiled to a monthly fee calculated based on cost and proﬁt sharing with minimum of USD 2.2 million per annum.
The other components of the cost of methanol sales are feed gas costs, plant operational costs, salaries and other allowances, contract labor, fuel consumption and material used.
Cost of HSD sales primarily is purchase price of this product from the  producer.
The increase in cost of production for chemicals primarily represents  cost of HSD purchases from suppliers (while in 2006 there was no HSD distribution), while costs of methanol in 2007 did not increase signiﬁcantly as the volume of production decreased.
Power At the moment, MedcoEnergi sells its electric power generated by its subsidiaries to the State Electricity Company (PLN).
The subsidiaries of MedcoEnergi that currently operate in this ﬁeld are PT Mitra Energi Batam (MEB) and PT Dalle Energy Batam (DEB).
MEB is the operator of Panaran I, a power plant with the capacity of 2 X 27.75 MW and 7.5 MW chiller.

The signiﬁcant increase in net other expense in 2007 was mainly due to: a.
an increase in ﬁnancing charges of USD 8.1 million as a result of  a number of new short and long term loans in 2007 as working  capital, general corporate purposes and project ﬁnancing; b.
an unrealized loss of USD 8.0 million from swap transactions  in 2007 compared to an unrealized gain of USD 39.5 million in 2006.
MedcoEnergi’s IDR Bonds were partly hedged by Cross Currency Swaps (CCS) which did not meet the criteria for ‘hedging transactions’ under SFAS No. 55.
As a result of this, any movement in the fair value of the swaps is to be recognized as a gain or loss in the current period, although the gain or loss from movement has not been realized.
Primarily due to strengthening of USD against IDR, MedcoEnergi recognized unrealized losses of USD 8 million due to changes in the fair value of the swaps, a decrease of USD 47.5 million from gains of USD 39.5 million in 2006.
Despite the (unrealized) loss being recognized on the swap transaction as noted above, on a cash basis, in 2007 the swaps have reduced payments for interest on IDR Bonds by USD 3.4 million; c.
an increase in interest expense of USD 24.9 million as a result of new  loan facilities from Bank Mandiri, BNI, Natixis de Banque (Natixis), other loan facilities and full year accrual for interest from Convertible Bonds which was issued in May 2006; d.
the sale of the Company’s participating interests in the Sorento  Dome assets in the United States of America, which resulted in a  loss of USD 20.5 million; and  e.
US asset impairment of USD 25.9 million was recognized due to  downward adjustment of petroleum reserves in the East Cameron block.
The impairment expense is non-cash in nature, which will reduce future depletion charges by such amount from production of petroleum reserves from East Cameron.
Revenues from other contracts for power business represent the Operation and Management (O&M) services for Tanjung Jati B which has been eﬀective since September 19, 2005 for a period of 23 years.
The increase is in line with increase in the level of O&M operations in 2007.

The signiﬁcant increase was due to full year depreciation of a couple of turbines in 2007, and only partial year depreciation in 2006 (operation started in July  2006).
MedcoEnergi’s depreciation and amortization increased by USD 1.3  million, or 50%, to USD 3.9 million in 2007 from USD 2.6 million in 2006, primarily attributable to the full operation of DEB in 2007.

The decrease in overall tax expense was due to the recognition of deferred tax beneﬁts from loss carry forward, which outweighed a slight increase in current tax expense paid by subsidiaries that posted net  income in 2007.

The excess funds were due to timing diﬀerence in utilizing cash for capex spending projections.
Trade Receivables NetThe Trade receivables rose by 83.7% to USD 219.2 million in 2007 from USD 119.4 million in 2006.
This was mainly due to higher realized oil & gas prices, the increase in rig utilization rates and the average daily revenue (especially from jack-up rigs) in Apexindo, and the new operation of high speed diesel distribution company, PT Medco Sarana Kalibaru.
Inventories The inventories increased by 33.6% to USD 64.8 million in 2007 from USD 48.5 million in 2006 mainly due to the new operation of the Company’s high speed diesel distribution.
Restricted Cash in Banks The Restricted cash in banks increased by 146.9% to USD 11.4 million in 2007 from USD 4.6 million in 2006 due to the requirement of an escrow account from Banque de Natixis in relation to the Soehanah Jack-up project ﬁnancing in April 2007.
Non Current Assets Other Receivables from Third Party - NetOther receivables decreased signiﬁcantly by 75.6% to USD 11.2 million in 2007 from USD 45.8 million in 2006 due to the repayment of cash calls especially under Senoro Toili JOB PSC and reimbursement of VAT from BP Migas.
Accounts Receivables from a Related Party  Accounts receivables from a related party decreased signiﬁcantly by 97.2% to USD 0.3 million in 2007 from USD 11.2 million in 2006 due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% shares in Medco Moeco Langsa (Langsa block) thru MEPL in November 2007.
With this acquisition MEPL became a consolidated subsidiary, and the receivable was eliminated in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of MedcoEnergi.
Investment in Shares of Stock The increase in Investment in Shares of Stocks in 2007 of 60.3%, or equal to USD 6.4 million, to USD 16.9 million from USD 10.6 million in 2006 was mainly due to the acquisition of Trada International shares in the amount of USD 12.3 million which was partially oﬀset by the consolidation of MML after acquiring 50% of the shares in November  2007.
Investment in Projects Investments in projects decreased by 15.8% to USD 36.2 million in 2007 from USD 43.0 million in 2006, mainly due to the conversion of investment in Bawean and Bangkanai projects into working interests in the respective PSCs.
Property, Plant and Equipment The increase in property, plant and equipment in 2007 by 7.9%, or equal to USD 37.1million, to USD 506.6 million in 2007 from USD 469.5 million in 2006 was mainly due to the costs of the new jack-up rig, Soehanah that were incurred in 2007.
Oil and Gas Properties The increase in oil and gas properties in 2007 of 18.8%, or equal to USD 108.3 million, to USD 686.0 million in 2007 from USD 577.7 million in 2006 was mainly due to several new acquisitions of international assets,an additional acquisition of interest in the Block A PSC, the consolidation of the Langsa block (previously accounted for as equity investment), and an increase due to capitalization of expenditures incurred on existing international and domestic oil and gas assets.

The increase was mainly due to: Current Liabilities Short term bank loansIncrease in short term bank loans by USD 57.6 million was due the addition of a loan from Bank Mandiri.
Trade Payables- 3rd partiesThe increase in Trade payables to third parties in 2007 was 46% higher, or equal to USD 28.4 million, to USD 90.6 million from USD 62.2 million in 2006 which was primarily due to the increase in rig utilization and average daily costs especially for the jack-up rigs in Apexindo.
Taxes Payable The increase in Taxes payables in 2007 was 22% higher, or equal to USD 9.2 million, to USD 51 million from USD 41.8 million in 2006.
The increase is in line with current corporate income tax due by MedcoEnergi in 2007.
Accrued Expenses The increase in Accrued expenses in 2007 was 85% higher, or equal to USD 43.1 million, to USD 93.5 million from USD 50.5 million in 2006.
The increase was primarily due to the accrued interest relating to loans/debts, including debts newly obtained in 2007, and increased severance and contract services which were mainly related to Medco E&P Indonesia.
Current Maturities – Long Term Loans and Other Long Term  ObligationsThe increase in Current maturities – long term loans in 2007 was 112% higher, or equal to USD 15.9 million, to USD 30.2 million from USD 14.2 million in 2006.
The increase was primarily due to higher working capital loans of MedcoEnergi and the current portion of Apexindo’s loan from Natixis in the amount of USD 21 million for Soehanah rig.
Current maturities of other long term obligations decrease by USD 25.7 million due to payment of Note Payable due during the year.
Non Current Liabilities Long Term Loans – bank loansThe increase in Long term bank loans in 2007 was 299% higher, or equal to USD 163.3 million, to USD 217.9 million from USD 54.7 million in 2006.
Such increase was due to the ﬁnancing for the Soehanah rig from Natixis in the amount of USD 92.2 million and a General Corporate Purpose Facility from Bank BNI in the amount of USD 50 million and a Working Capital Loan from Bank Mandiri of USD 30 million.
Payable under construction contract The decrease in payable under construction in 2007 was 100%, or equal to USD 100.7 million.
The decrease was due to the completion of the Soehanah rig, whereby this payable was reﬁnanced through the Natixis  loan.
Advance from customer The balance of advance from customer as of December 31, 2007 of USD 127.6 million was received from Itochu as the buyer of MedcoEnergi’s oil production from the Kaji/Semoga ﬁeld.

As noted above, the increase was mainly due to loans from Bank Mandiri, Bank BNI and Natixis, as outlined in more detailed below:  Bank Mandiri and Bank BNI.
In 2007 the Company obtained loan  facilities from Mandiri and BNI.
As of 31 December 2007 the Company has drawn down a total of USD 136.3 million from these facilities, USD 86.3 million from Mandiri and USD 50 million from BNI.
From the USD 86.3 million proceeds from Mandiri, USD 56.3 million is due in March 2008, while USD 30 million is due in December 2012.
The loan from BNI  is due in June 2010.
Natixis.
Apexindo, a subsidiary, also secured a loan of USD 113.99  million from Natixis in 2007, which represents a re-ﬁnancing of the construction contract payable accruing since 2005 of USD 100.7 million as of December 31, 2006 for the construction of the Soehanah rig which was completed in mid 2007.
This loan is repayable in annual installments from 2008 to 2014.
Compliance with Debt Covenants The Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the existing covenants and their existing banking facilities and long-term obligations, except DEB, and except with respect to the ﬁnancial ratio requirement under USD and IDR bonds regarding maximum debt to equity ratio (DER) of 1.75x.
DEB did not meet certain ﬁnancial covenants but have received wavers from their respective banks.
At December 31, 2007, MedcoEnergi did not meet the aforementioned DER maximum requirement.
On March 26, 2008, the Company sold a 2.5% interest in Apexindo triggering the deconsolidation of USD 190 million in debt.
The sale of Apexindo shares and the related impact placed MedcoEnergi back into compliance with the bond covenant, and the Company informed the Trustee of this matter in accordance with the respective bond agreements.
MedcoEnergi’s primary source of liquidity is free cashﬂow and use  of ﬁnancing.
Management continues to believe that such internally generated cashﬂow and its debt-to-equity ratios are such that it will be adequate to service existing debt and to continue to pay dividends and ﬁnance future growth.
Free operating cashﬂow is a measurement that is not the same as net  cashﬂow from operating activities per the statement of cashﬂow and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by USD 139.3 million  to USD 451.9 million in 2007 from USD 312.6 million in 2006.
The signiﬁcant portion of the cash outﬂows for investment activities continued to be expenditures for acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, exploration activities, as well as the acquisition of property and equipment in 2007.
Net cash provided in Financing Activities was USD 104.1 million in 2007,  mainly due to the proceeds from the loans obtained from Mandiri and BNI, which were oﬀset primarily by payments for long terms notes payable, treasury stock, and dividends.

The decreases in proﬁtability ratios in 2007 were primarily due to MedcoEnergi’s losses from its US assets.
