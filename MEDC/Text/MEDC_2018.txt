In total, these dispositions will raise proceeds of US$260 million by quarter three 2019.
During 2018 both MPI and AMNT were able to demonstrate that they have the capacity to stand alone and refinance maturities and raise funds for future developments.
MPI successfully issued a combination of conventional and shariah bonds, raising approximately IDR 1.2 trillion for refinancing and investment in the Riau and Ijen power generation projects.
AMNT also secured US$1.2 billion funding from four major Asian banks in order to fully fund the development of phase 7 of the Batu Hijau.
