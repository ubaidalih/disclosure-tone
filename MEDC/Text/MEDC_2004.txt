110 MedcoEnergi Laporan Tahunan  2004Laporan dan Kinerja Keuangan    Financial Performance and Report In line with MedcoEnergi’s continuing endeavor to  expand its operational  activities, the Company ensures that these efforts are supported by discipline and conservative ﬁnancial management practices.
Such practices encompass ongoing pursuit for optimum ﬁnancial leverage and relentless drive for cost efﬁciency.
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES   Throughout 2004, MedcoEnergi has been actively involved in a number of activities to strengthen the Company’s ﬁnancial structure to support its reserves enhancement and business diversiﬁcation activities. 43.82% increase in oil and gas properties.
In July 2004, MedcoEnergi  has completed the acquisition of 100% of Novus Petroleum Limited (Novus), an Australian oil and gas company managing exploration and production ﬁelds located in 7 countries, including Indonesia, Australia, Oman and United Arab Emirates.
Consequently, by year end 2004, the Company’s oil and gas property increased by 43.82% to US$ 449.15 million, from 2003 record of US$ 312.29 million.  43.4% increase in total assets.
The increase in oil and gas properties  has increased the Total Assets by 43.4% to US$ 1.411 billion, from    US$ 984.44 million in 2003. 63.28% increase in non-current liabilities.
To support the  business expansion throughout 2004, MedcoEnergi has issued 5-year corporate bonds totaled Rp 1,350 billion, or roughly US$ 144 million, listed in the Surabaya Stock Exchange.
The bond was rated AA- by    PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (Peﬁndo), reﬂecting market conﬁdence toward the Company’s performance and future prospects.
With this bond issuance, the Company’s ﬁnancial leverage slightly increased as indicated by Total Non-current Liabilities that rose by 63.28% to    US$ 534.75 million, from US$ 327.5 million in 2003.
Consequently, Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) rose to 1.02 times, from last year’s ﬁgure of    0.68 times.
Despite their marginal contribution, these new plants represent the Company’s ﬁrm commitment to increase the shareholders value and become an energy company of choice.
MedcoEnergi’s revenues remain to be derived from three primary sources,  they are, sales of crude oil and natural gas, services provided under drilling contracts and sales of methanol.
The total operating revenues for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 were US$ 535.10 million and US$ 448.99 million, respectively, which represents 19.18% increase.
From the total revenues, 65.85%, or US$ 352.36 million were attributed  to the oil and gas sales, while 19.81%, or US$ 105.99 million were contributed by the Company’s drilling services.
Sales of methanol contributed 10.37% of total revenues, or US$ 55.49 million.
In 2004, as MedcoEnergi commenced its LPG Plant and Power Plant  operations, it began to earn revenues from those businesses.
LPG Plant, effectively operating for 9 months during 2004 starting from    2 April 2004, generated US$ 6.68 million of revenues, while the Power Plant, which has been in operation for 2 months in 2004 starting from 29 October 2004, generated US$ 1.53 million.
OIL AND GAS Revenue from oil and gas sales in 2004 reﬂected the combined results of Medco E&P Indonesia and MEAPL.
Medco E&P Indonesia continued  to experience decline in its crude production from its Rimau block operation.
The production decreased from 51.76 MBOPD in 2003 to 36.08 MBOPD in 2004, however, it was offset by the increasing average crude oil price from US$ 29.33/barrel in 2003 to US$ 36.78/barrel in 2004.
In addition to that, gas sales increased from 87.3 MMBTUD in 2003 to 106.7 MMBTUD in 2004 with the gas prices amounting US$ 1.61/MBTU in 2003 and US$ 1.66/MBTU in 2004.
Among the key factors determining the Company’s oil and gas revenues  are the net entitlement volume of oil and gas and the prices at which they are sold.
Under the terms of the PSCs, MedcoEnergi’s net entitlement consists of (i) cost recovery and (ii) proﬁt share, net of domestic market obligations.
In 2004, the Company sold its crude oil production to PT Pertamina  (Persero), Mitsui Oil (Asia) Hongkong.
(Itochu), and PTT Public Company Limited (PTT) at prices based on the Indonesian Crude Price-Sumatra Light Crude/Minas (the ICP-SLC), with adjustments based on the crude oil quality.
The ICP-SLC is the monthly mean average of three publications: (i) twice a week by APPI, a panel of international producers, traders and reﬁnery, (ii) daily by RIM, oil industry publishers which focus on the market in the Asia-Paciﬁc region, and (iii) Platts, oil industry publishers which focus on the Japanese market, in the following proportions: 20% APPI, 40% RIM and 40% Platts.
Pertamina publishes the ICP-SLC once every month.
Under the PSC Arrangement, MedcoEnergi’s net crude entitlement could  be sold to a third party through a competitive tender process.
Under the revised agreement, the crude oil quantity to be supplied by the Company shall be about 50% of its available quantity for export (ranging from 7 to 10 MBPD).
On    12 November 2004 the Company announced Itochu as the winning of the bidder of the Kaji Semoga Crude Oil, therefore, starting from 1 January up to 31 December 2005 , Itochu becomes the offtaker of the Kaji Semoga Crude Oil.
Due to the increase of average realized price for oil per barrel for  the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 were US$ 29.33 and    US$ 36.78, respectively, the Company’s oil and gas sales in 2004 increased by 17.03%, to US$ 352.36 million from US$ 301.07 million in 2003, despite the decrease in our net oil entitlement by 13.11%, from  24.4 MBOPD in 2003 to 21.2 MBOPD.
From the total oil and gas sales of US$ 352.36 million in 2004, about  32.08%, or US$ 113.04 million was generated from the sales to PTT Public Company Ltd.
, followed by Mitsui Oil (Asia) Hongkong Ltd.
, which purchased US$ 99.82 million worth of oil and gas, or 28.33% of total sales.
Meanwhile, US$ 59.37 million or 16.85% of total was generated from the sales to PT Pertamina (Persero).
When evaluated based on ﬁeld contributions, a large part of MedcoEnergi’s  oil and gas sales particularly in Medco E&P Indonesia was generated from Rimau PSC, as its oil and gas production comprised of 67.75% of the Company’s total production.
The realized gas prices per MMBTU for the year ended 31 December 2004 were US$ 1.32 for gas sales to PUSRI, US$ 2.50 to PLN and US$ 1.42 to    PT Medco Methanol Bunyu (MMB), the Company’s petrochemical subsidiary.
The costs of developing and operating the gas ﬁelds are low, as most of the natural gas the Company produced is associated gas produced from our oil ﬁelds.
Drilling Operations.
MedcoEnergi’s revenues from drilling operations vary based upon demand for drilling and related services, which affects the number of days that the rig ﬂeet is utilized and the day rates received.
Demand for drilling rigs is affected by a number of factors including the level of oil and gas exploration and production activities.
Revenues from drilling contracts may also ﬂuctuate due to the timing of contract completions, mobilizations, scheduled maintenance and weather conditions.
Revenues from drilling operations are recognized as work is performed.
When mobilization or rig enhancement is required for a contract, MedcoEnergi may receive a lump-sum payment to offset all or a portion of the cost.
When an offshore rig is moved from one location to another under contract, mobilization revenues and costs incurred are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract.
If a rig is moved without a contract, all costs incurred are immediately charged against income.
Payments received for rig enhancements are recognized as Revenues over the term of the related drilling contract.
For offshore rigs, the average revenue per day rose 27.14% to US$ 44,376  in 2004 from US$ 34,904 in 2003.
While for onshore rigs, the average revenue per day increased 4.66% to US$ 8,314 in 2004 from US$ 7,944 in 2003.
Average daily cost for offshore rigs, on the other hand, increased 22% to US$ 24,533 in 2004 from 16,503 in 2003.
Average daily cost for onshore rigs decreased by 18% to US$ 5,921 in 2004 from US$ 7,221 in  2003.
From its drilling services, the Company earned revenues amounted   US$ 105.99 million, increase 18.88% from last year’s ﬁgure of US$ 89.16  million.
This is primarily driven by the recovery of offshore rig utilization to 100% in 2004 from 78% in 2003.
Nevertheless, the onshore rig utilization decrease to 53% in 2004 from 57% in 2003.
Since April 1997, MedcoEnergi has earned revenues from   PT Medco Methanol Bunyu (MMB), its subsidiary that manages the production and sales of methanol at Bunyu island, East Kalimantan.
Revenues from methanol sales are affected by production volume and the sales prices.
Sales of methanol slightly increased to US$ 55.4 million in 2004, from  US$ 55.1 million in 2003, in the midst of increasing methanol price.
This is due to lower production volume, from 723 MT/day in 2004 versus 783 MT/day in 2003 – due to scheduled shutdown of the plant for maintenance and repairs and unscheduled shutdown of the plant which was caused by the turbine and compressor troubles.
Methanol prices are volatile and over the last six years have reached  a high of US$ 264.17/MT in March 2004 for domestic sales and    US$ 237.59/MT (f.
) in May 2004 for export sales, and a low of   US$ 72/MT in December 1998 for domestic sales and US$ 70/MT (f.
) in November 1998 for export sales.
The average price per MT realized during the year increased by 8.49%, to US$ 230 from US$ 212 in 2003. 114 MedcoEnergi Laporan Tahunan  2004COST OF SALES AND DIRECT EXPENSES MedcoEnergi’s total direct expenses increased 9.87%, to US$ 267.62 million  from US$ 243.57 million in 2003.
The major contributor for such increase was the increase in direct expenses of drilling operations for 34.22% to    US$ 94.16 million from US$ 70.16 million in 2003.
Methanol cost of sales rose 35.65% to US$ 34.03 million from US$ 25.09 million in 2003.
Meanwhile, Exploration and Production (E&P) direct expenses decreased by 6.05% to    US$ 139.35 million from US$ 148.33 million in 2003.
Oil and Gas.
E&P direct costs mainly comprise of lifting expenses,  exploration expenses, depreciation, and amortization expenses.
The factors affecting lifting expenses are: the level of production, salaries and wages, employee beneﬁts, materials and supplies, contract charges, business travel expenses and pipeline fees.
Exploration expenses vary with the level of exploration activities and the  success rate of such activities.
Depreciation and amortization are caused by the depletion of capitalized oil and gas development costs under the unit of production depletion method.
Between 1997 and 2001, the most recent period for which industry data provided by Pertamina is available, MedcoEnergi had on average the lowest exploration and development costs, and one of the lowest operation and production costs of any oil and gas operator in Indonesia.
For the year 2004, MedcoEnergi’s average total lifting costs and average  ﬁnding and development costs was approximately US$ 3.48 per BOE and US$ 3.47 per BOE.
Such costs are achieved through employment of local professionals, the existing infrastructure in place near its producing blocks and the geographic concentration of its oil ﬁelds.
For the past years, approximately 10%-15% of MedcoEnergi’s costs were denominated in Rupiah.
The Company believes that its cost structure allows it to sustain even in a low crude oil price environment.
The 6.05% or US$ 8.97 million decreases in E&P direct expenses were  primarily due to 17.30% increase in depreciation and amortization, to US$ 55.73 million in 2004 from US$ 47.51 million in 2003, and 11.92% decrease in production and lifting expenses, to US$ 59.77 million from US$ 79.50 million in 2003.
Meanwhile, exploration expenses increased by 11.92% to US$ 23.85 million from US$ 21.31 million in 2003.
Drilling Operations.
Operating costs are not affected by changes in  dayrates, nor are they affected by ﬂuctuations in utilization.
For instance, when a rig is idle for a short period of time, the Company realizes few decreases in operating expenses since the rig typically is maintained in a ready-to-operate state with a full crew.
However, when a rig were expected to be idle for a longer period of time, MedcoEnergi could reduce the size of the rig’s crew and take steps to maintain the rig in an idle “stacked” mode, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the negative impact on operating income associated with loss of revenues.
Operating costs may also be impacted by MedcoEnergi’s ability to  successfully hire and train sufﬁcient numbers of employees to operate its drilling equipment.
MedcoEnergi recognizes repair and maintenance expenditures that maintain rather than upgrade rigs as operating costs.
Laporan dan Kinerja Keuangan    Financial Performance and Report 115 2004 MedcoEnergi Annual ReportThe 34.22% increase in drilling operations’ direct expenses was  mainly attributable to the increases in the costs of Labor, Repair and Maintenance, Drilling Equipment, and Depreciation and Amortization.
Costs of sales of methanol increased by 35.65% to   US$ 34.03 million from US$ 25.09 million in 2003, primarily as a result of an increase in methanol plant rental expense due to re-negotiation of the price with Pertamina which owns the plant.
The increase was also contributed by the increase in reﬁnery plant operational costs due to higher number of days of the plant’s downtime from 27 days in 2003 to 42 days in 2004.
GROSS PROFIT In 2004, MedcoEnergi has managed to earn 30.21% increase in Gross Proﬁt as it rose to US$ 267.48 million from US$ 205.42 million in 2003.
Such increase was mainly attributable to strong revenue growth that reaches 19.18%.
E&P Gross Proﬁt increased by 39.45% to US$ 213 million from US$ 152.75  million in 2003.
Drilling services gross proﬁt decreased by 37.76% to    US$ 11.83 million from US$ 19 million in 2003.
While Methanol operation gross proﬁt decreased by 28.54% from US$ 21.46 million in 2004, compared to US$ 30.03 million in 2003.
The Gross Proﬁt margin for E&P, Drilling and Methanol in 2004 were  60.45%, 11.16% and 38.67%, respectively.
OPERATING EXPENSES All major contracts entered into by the Company have been – and anticipated to continue to be – denominated in US Dollar.
Such contracts include PSCs, TACs, JOBs, drilling contracts, agreements with joint venture partners, major construction contracts, drilling leases, service contracts, oil and gas sales contracts and transportation agreements.
The Company collects the major portion of its revenues in US Dollar and signiﬁcant portions of the Company’s expenses are also denominated in US Dollar.
Only certain expenses such as the salaries of Indonesian employees, costs of local vendors and local rentals, are paid in Rupiah.
Rupiah expenses represented approximately 10%-15% of total expenses for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Therefore, the Company’s exposure to the Rupiah currency risk is limited.
Operating expenses increased by 44.03% to US$ 88.45 million from    US$ 61.41 million in 2003, which mainly due to an increase in salaries and  wages and other employees beneﬁt and contract charges.
The increase in salaries, wages and other employees beneﬁt is due to acquisition of Novus in 2004 and operational cost of newly built of power plant.
The increase in contract charges is related to cost in acquiring its oil and gas assets.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN/LOSS Net foreign exchange decreased to loss amounted to US$ (6.88) million in 2004 from gain amounted to US$ 48.75 thousand in 2003, primarily due to the restatement of the Company’s non US Dollar denominated liabilities.
Such increase was mainly attributable to issuance of IDR Bond in July and United Overseas Bank (UOB) bridging loan facility in 2004.
TAX EXPENSES Oil and Gas.
Indonesian income tax rates (including dividends tax) on MedcoEnergi’s PSC operations vary from 44% to 56% depending on the contract area where the revenue is generated.
A change in the mix of production percentage from the areas operated by MedcoEnergi will change the effective tax rate.
Reported income tax expense is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the fact that  PSCs cannot be consolidated for Indonesian income tax purposes.
Each PSC is taxed individually and no cross deduction is allowed.
Income tax expense is more fully described in Note 30 of MedcoEnergi’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Tax expenses decreased by 13.31% to US$ 59.49 million from US$ 68.63  million in 2003, due to the lower oil production.
NET INCOME As a result of the foregoing, net income increased by 29.7% to US$ 70.12 million from US$ 54.08 million in 2003, slightly higher than the increase in our gross revenues of 19.18%, which means that the Company has been successfully controlled the operational expenses.
EQUITIES As a result of the foregoing, equities increased by 10.15% to US$ 537.15 million from US$ 487.65 million in 2003, which generated from the increase of the Company’s retained earning.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company’s operations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements have been partly funded from borrowings, both short-term and long-term, and cash generated from operations.
The Company generated US$ 136.27 million of net cash from operations in 2004, increased by 33.9% from US$ 101.77 in 2003.
The increase in net cash generated from operations was mainly due to 13.99% increase in cash receipt from customer to US$ 537.41 million from US$ 471.47 million in 2003.
Cash capital expenditure in 2004 was US$ 322.48 million, increased by  66.82% from previous year ﬁgure of US$ 193.31 million.
Such expenditure primarily related to additions to oil and gas properties and acquisitions of property and equipment. 2005 OUTLOOK The Company’s budgeted capital expenditures for each business unit in ﬁscal year of 2005 are as follows:• Exploration and development activities: approximately US$ 219.49  million; • Drilling: approximately US$ 5.99 million; • Methanol: approximately US$ 0.55 million; and• Power Plants: approximately US$ 5.43 million.
In addition to the budgeted development and exploration expenditures relating to the Company’s oil and gas properties described above, the Company may make additional capital expenditures and investments, consistent with its business strategy.
For instance, the above budgeted amounts do not include any investments the Company may make in downstream businesses or acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
The Company’s ability to maintain and grow its revenues, net income  and cash ﬂows depends upon continued capital spending.
The Company adjusts its capital expenditure and investment budget periodically, based on prevailing market conditions.
The preparation of Capital Expenditure and Investment Plan incorporates a number of risks, contingencies and other external factors.
Therefore, discrepancies between planned and actual ﬁgures of capital expenditures and investments are likely to exist.
The Company believes that its future cash ﬂows from operations,  borrowing capacity and the net proceeds of the issuance of the notes will be sufﬁcient to fund its planned capital expenditures and investments, debt maturities and working capital requirements.
The Company’s ability to obtain adequate ﬁnancing to satisfy its capital expenditure and debt service requirements may be limited by its ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and the liquidity of international and domestic ﬁnancial markets.
