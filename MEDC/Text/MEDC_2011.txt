MedcoEnergi 2011 Annual Report 21Financial Review and Strategy Net Income &  ProÔ¨Åt Attributable  to Shareholder MedcoEnergi is  very pleased with  the high results  of performance  achieved in 2011.
The new Board  of Directors‚Äô  commitment to refocus  MedcoEnergi‚Äôs  business to oil &  gas returned a  better Ô¨Ånancial  result in 2011  compared to 2010.
In 2011, the Company recorded a  higher net income of USS$89.2  million, compared to a prior  year net income of US$88.2  million, with proÔ¨Åt attributable  to the shareholders amounting  to US$85.1 million, slightly  higher than that of the prior year  of US$83.1 million.
Thus, the  earning per share attributable to  shareholders in 2011 increased to  US$0.0289 from US$0.0282 last  year.
The Company‚Äôs net income in 2011  was entirely generated from the  oil & gas business which recorded  a net income of US$109.9 million.
The oil & gas net income in  2011 increased signiÔ¨Åcantly  from US$5.7 million in 2010.
The  increase was due to a higher  realized average oil price in  2011, amounting to US$113.68/barrel, compared to US$81.41/ barrel in 2010, and the Company‚Äôs  successful efforts in cost  efÔ¨Åciency.
The high net income recorded from  the oil & gas business offset by  the adverse result from the non  oil & gas business, and a gain on  disposal of subsidiaries enabled  the Company to achieve a higher  net income in 2011.
Total Sales & Other Operating  Revenues In 2011 MedcoEnergi recorded a  total sales and other operating  revenues of US$1,143.3 million,  IJHIFSUIBO64NJMMJPO in 2010.

Additionally, the  Company successfully negotiated  an increase of the realized gas  price to US$3.80/MMBTU and  sold 59.1 BCF in 2011, compared to  the realized gas price of US$3.62/ MMBTU and sales volume of 56.6  BCF last year.
